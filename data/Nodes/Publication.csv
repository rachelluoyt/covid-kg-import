doi:10.1016/s0168-1702(97)00081-6,Generation of cytopathogenic subgenomic RNA of classical swine fever virus in persistently infected porcine cell lines,doi:10.1016/s0168-1702(97)00081-6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133997/,pubmed:9498611,pmc:PMC7133997,Virus Res,2003,Generation of cytopathogenic subgenomic RNA of classical swine fever virus in persistently infected porcine cell lines,Two biological clones  A.1 and B.2  of the classical swine fever virus strain Alfort 187 and the recombinant virus vA187-1  derived from a cDNA clone of Alfort 187  were used to establish persistently infected cultures oft he swine kidney cell lines SK-6 and PK-41. It was found that 100% of the cells in the passaged cultures were positive for viral antigen throughout the course of the experiment. Additionally  supernatants collected upon passaging of the cells continuously contained high titers of infectious virus. In six separate cultures persistently infected with either the biological clones or the recombinant virus  a cytopathic effect occurred spontaneously between passage 8 and 94. The cytopathogenic agent in the supernatants of these cultures could be passaged repeatedly  suggesting the generation of a mutant virus. Analysis of RNA from such cultures revealed the presence of a subgenomic viral RNA of approximately 8 kilobases  kb . In all six cases  this RNA had an identical internal deletion of 4764 nucleotides  including the region coding for all structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA replicated and was packaged in the presence of wild-type virus. Cells infected with cytopathogenic virus contained increased amounts of the viral protein NS3 thought to be involved in pestivirus cytopathogenicity.

Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here  we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern  VOCs  representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2  first associated with infections in India  and B.1.351  first associated with infection in South Africa  lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2  Pfizer BioNTech  and ChAdOx1  Oxford AstraZeneca  vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals  the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351  South African  variant  6.29-fold reduction  that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2  conferred reductions in titre of 7.77  11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1  B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses  the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69  4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs  and others  demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly  booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.

This study aimed at evaluating the neutralizing activity against the viral variants emerged in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7   Brazil  B.1.1.28.1   and South Africa  B.1.351  in human serum samples from hospitalized patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave in Italy in 2020. METHODS: Serum samples of 42 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Italy between March and May 2020  were included in the present study. Samples available for each patient at three time points were selected: hospital admission sample  sample showing the highest neutralizing antibody titre against 2019-nCov Italy-INMI1 strain  Wuhan strain   and the last sample available during hospital stay. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody against B.1.1.7  B.1.1.28.1  and B.1.351 wild type viruses by micro-neutralization assay. RESULTS: The decrease of neutralizing antibody titre for all three variants was statistically significant at any time point. At discharge decease  59.5% of patients showed a decrease  ≥2 fold  in neutralizing antibody titre against the B.1.1.7 variant  83.3% against the B.1.1.28.1 variant  and 90.5% against the B.1.351 variant with respect to the original strain. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of neutralizing antibody titres against all analysed variants  and in particular B.1.1.28.1 and B.1.351 ones  suggests that previous symptomatic infection might be not fully protective to exposure of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying a set of relevant spike mutations. KEY MESSAGES: A reduction in neutralizing antibody titres against B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.1.28.1 variants was observed. Previous symptomatic infection might be not fully protective to exposure of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying a set of relevant spike mutations.

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite  VIIRS  night-time light datasets can precisely detect the intensity and scope of human activities. Accurate and temporal monitoring of urban areas and urban sprawls is highly imperative to the detection and assessment of regional development of a region. This study quantitatively assessed and mapped the light extents and urban region in Kerala  one of the southwest Indian states from 2012 to 2020 with the help of low light imaging day night band data collected from the VIIRS and utilised VIIRS night time Lights V.2 time series from the monthly averages with filtering to eliminate extraneous features such as aurora  biomass burning  and background. ISOCLUSTER based classification and the threshold methods are used for the light extent and urban region extraction respectively. The result indicated that the Kerala State experienced very high urbanization from 2012 to 2019. But in the case of 2020  there was a decrement in the radiance due to the lockdown and night curfews followed by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Normal life including transportation  industries  and business  etc. was affected much before the national lockdown in Kerala. It was proved with the help of time series data generated from mid-2019 to the end of 2020. The time-series data was generated with 580 night light datasets of NASA’s Black Marble VNP46A2 from 1st June 2019 to 31st December 2020 on daily basis. [Image: see text]

We aim to study national population level SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 associated hospitalisations by vaccination status to provide insight into the association of vaccination on temporal trends during the time in which the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became dominant in Scotland. METHODS: We used the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance  EAVE II  platform  covering the period when Delta was pervasive  May 01 to October 23  2021 . We performed a cohort analysis of every vaccine-eligible individual aged 20 or over from across Scotland. We determined the vaccination coverage  SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate and COVID-19 associated hospitalisations incidence rate. We then stratified those rates by age group  vaccination status  defined as “unvaccinated”  “partially vaccinated”  1 dose   or “fully vaccinated”  2 doses    vaccine type  BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19   and coexisting conditions known to be associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: During the follow-up of 4 183 022 individuals  there were 407 405 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with 10 441  2.6%  associated with a hospital admission. Those vaccinated with two doses  defined as fully vaccinated in the current study  of either vaccine had lower incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and much lower incidence rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalisations than those unvaccinated in the Delta era in Scotland. Younger age groups were substantially more likely to get infected. In contrast  older age groups were much more likely to be hospitalised. The incidence rates stratified by coexisting conditions were broadly comparable with the overall age group patterns. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that national population level vaccination was associated with a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 associated hospitalisation in Scotland throughout the Delta era.

In early 2021  northeastern France experienced an outbreak of Beta that was not observed elsewhere. This outbreak slightly preceded and then overlapped with a second outbreak of the better understood VOC Alpha  B.1.1.7  in the region. This situation allowed us to contemporaneously compare Alpha and Beta in terms of the characteristics  management  and outcomes of critically ill patients. METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted on all consecutive adult patients who had laboratory confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection  underwent variant screening  and were admitted to one of four intensive care units  ICU  for acute respiratory failure between January 9th and May 15th  2021. Primary outcome was 60-day mortality. Differences between Alpha and Beta in terms of other outcomes  patient variables  management  and vaccination characteristics were also explored by univariate analysis. The factors that associated with 60-day death in Alpha- and Beta-infected patients were examined with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total  333 patients  median age  63 years; 68% male  were enrolled. Of these  174 and 159 had Alpha and Beta  respectively. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of 60-day mortality  19 vs. 23%   28-day mortality  17 vs. 20%   need for mechanical ventilation  60 vs. 61%   mechanical ventilation duration  14 vs. 15 days   other management variables  patient demographic variables  comorbidities  or clinical variables on ICU admission. The vast majority of patients were unvaccinated  94% . The remaining 18 patients had received a partial vaccine course and 2 were fully vaccinated. The vaccinated patients were equally likely to have Alpha and Beta. CONCLUSIONS: Beta did not differ from Alpha in terms of patient characteristics  management  or outcomes in critically ill patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT04906850.

Several dozens of mutations have been observed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus  during the last two years. Some of the mutated strains show a greater infectivity and are capable of suppressing the earlier strains  through interference. In this work  kinetic and thermodynamic properties were calculated for strains characterized by various numbers and locations of mutations. It was shown that mutations lead to changes in chemical composition  thermodynamic properties and infectivity. Through competition  the phenomenon of interference of various SARS-CoV-2 strains was explained  which results in suppression of the wild type by mutant strains. Standard Gibbs energy of binding and binding constant for the Omicron  B.1.1.529  strain were found to be Δ B G⁰ = −45.96 kJ mol and K B  = 1.13 ∙ 10 +8  M −1   respectively.
doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.820250,Natural SARS-CoV-2 Infection Affects Neutralizing Activity in Saliva of Vaccinees,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.820250,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8962193/,,pmc:PMC8962193,Front Immunol,2022,Natural SARS-CoV-2 Infection Affects Neutralizing Activity in Saliva of Vaccinees,BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 transmission mainly occurs through exposure of the upper airway mucosa to infected secretions such as saliva  which are excreted by an infected person. Thus  oral mucosal immunity plays a central role in the prevention of and early defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although virus-specific antibody response has been extensively investigated in blood samples of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and vaccinees  local humoral immunity in the oral cavity and its relationship to systemic antibody levels needs to be further addressed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We fine-tuned a virus neutralization assay  vNTA  to measure the neutralizing activity  NA  of plasma and saliva samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2-infected  SI   40 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated  SV   and 28 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated subjects with a history of infection  SIV  using the “wild type” SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1  EU  and the Delta  B.1.617.2  strains. To validate the vNTA results  the presence of neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  to the spike receptor binding domain  RBD  was evaluated with an ELISA assay. RESULTS: NA to SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1  EU  was present in plasma samples from all the tested subjects  with higher titers in SIV compared to both SI and SV. Conversely  NA was detected in saliva samples from 10.3% SV  45% SI  and 92.6% SIV  with significantly lower titers in SV compared to both SI and SIV. The detection of NAbs in saliva reflected its reduced NA in SV. DISCUSSION: The difference in NA of plasma vs. saliva was confirmed in a vNTA where the SARS-CoV-2 B.1 and Delta strains were tested head-to-head  which also revealed a reduced NA of both specimens compared to the B.1 variant. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was associated with limited virus NA in the oral cavity  as measured in saliva and in comparison to plasma. This difference was more evident in vaccinees without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection  possibly highlighting the importance of local exposure at the site of virus acquisition to effectively prevent the infection and block its spread. Nevertheless  the presence of immune escape mutations as possibly represented by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant negatively affects both local and systemic efficacy of NA associated with vaccination.
pubmed:34873578,Omicron  B.1.1.529 : Infectivity  vaccine breakthrough  and antibody resistance,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8647651/,pubmed:34873578,pmc:PMC8647651,ArXiv,2021,Omicron  B.1.1.529 : Infectivity  vaccine breakthrough  and antibody resistance,The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variant Omicron  B.1.1.529  has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike  S  protein receptor-binding domain  RBD . However  a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here  we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron’s infectivity  vaccine-breakthrough  and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence  AI  model  which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2  reveals that Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional  3D  structures of antibody-RBD complexes  we unveil that Omicron may be twice more likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug Administration  FDA -approved monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However  its impact to Regeneron mAb cocktail appears to be mild.

While Iran was among the first countries confronted with rapid spread of virus in February 2020  no real‐time SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐genome tracking in early phase of outbreak was performed in the country. To address this issue  we provided 50 whole‐genome sequences of viral isolates ascertained from different geographical locations in Iran during March–July 2020. The corresponding analysis on origins  transmission dynamics and genetic diversity of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus  represented at least two introductions of the virus into the country  constructing two major clusters defined as B.4 and B.1*. The first entry of the virus might have occurred around very late 2019 early 2020  as suggested by the time to the most recent common ancestor  followed by a rapid community transmission that led to dominancy of B.4 lineage in early epidemic till the end of June. Gradually  reduction in dominancy of B.4 occurred possibly as a result of other entries of the virus  followed by surge of B.1* lineages  as of mid‐May. Remarkably  variation tracking of the virus indicated the increase in frequency of D614G mutation  along with B.1* lineages  which showed continuity till October 2020. The increase in frequency of D614G mutation and B.1* lineages from mid‐May onwards predicts a rapid viral transmission that may push the country into a critical health situation followed by a considerable change in composition of viral lineages circulating in the country.

This relationship might differ for the recently emerged B.1.617.2  delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2. Here we use data from an outbreak in Sydney  Australia that commenced in winter and time-series analysis to investigate the association between reported cases and temperature and relative humidity. METHODS: Between 16 June and 10 September 2021  the peak of the outbreak  there were 31 662 locally-acquired cases reported in five local health districts of Sydney  Australia. The associations between daily 9:00 am and 3:00 pm temperature  °C   relative humidity  %  and their difference  and a time series of reported daily cases were assessed using univariable and multivariable generalized additive models and a 14-day exponential moving average. Akaike information criterion  AIC  and the likelihood ratio statistic were used to compare different models and determine the best fitting model. A sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the exponential moving average. RESULTS: During the 87-day time-series  relative humidity ranged widely  < 30–98%  and temperatures were mild  approximately 11–17 °C . The best-fitting  AIC: 1 119.64  generalized additive model included 14-day exponential moving averages of 9:00 am temperature  P < 0.001  and 9:00 am relative humidity  P < 0.001   and the interaction between these two weather variables  P < 0.001 . Humidity was negatively associated with cases no matter whether temperature was high or low. The effect of lower relative humidity on increased cases was more pronounced below relative humidity of about 70%; below this threshold  not only were the effects of humidity pronounced but also the relationship between temperature and cases of the delta variant becomes apparent. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the control of COVID-19 outbreaks  specifically those due to the delta variant  is particularly challenging during periods of the year with lower relative humidity and warmer temperatures. In addition to vaccination  stronger implementation of other interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing might need to be considered during these higher risk periods.

It is also the major antigen stimulating the host's protective immune response  specifically  the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recently  a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 possessing multiple mutations in the S protein  designated P.1  emerged in Brazil. Here  we characterized a P.1 variant isolated in Japan by using Syrian hamsters  a well-established small animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease  COVID-19 . In hamsters  the variant showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity similar to those of early and contemporary strains  i.e.  SARS-CoV-2 bearing aspartic acid [D] or glycine [G] at position 614 of the S protein . Sera and or plasma from convalescent patients and BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccinees showed comparable neutralization titers across the P.1 variant  S-614D  and S-614G strains. In contrast  the S-614D and S-614G strains were less well recognized than the P.1 variant by serum from a P.1-infected patient. Prior infection with S-614D or S-614G strains efficiently prevented the replication of the P.1 variant in the lower respiratory tract of hamsters upon reinfection. In addition  passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to hamsters infected with the P.1 variant or the S-614G strain led to reduced virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. However  the effect was less pronounced against the P.1 variant than the S-614G strain. These findings suggest that the P.1 variant may be somewhat antigenically different from the early and contemporary strains of SARS-CoV-2.

However  the potential interactions with host cells linking N501Y mutation to pathogenic relevance remain elusive. Recently  we and others report that kinases such as PI3K AKT signaling is essential in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here we analyzed the predicted potential kinases interacting with the mutation. Bioinformatics tools including structure-prediction based molecular docking analysis were applied. We found kinases such as EGFR might potentially act as new acceptors involving the N501Y mutation binding through possible phosphorylation at Y501 and enhanced affinity in certain variants. To our surprise  the Omicron receptor binding domain harboring N501Y mutation did not enhance binding to EGFR which might be due to the mutations of charged polar to uncharged polar side chains located on the interaction interfaces. Similarly  potent gains of phosphorylation in B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 by mutations were predicted and interaction networks were analyzed with enrichment of pathways. Given kinases might be elevated in cancer patients  the N501Y mutation containing lineages may be possibly much more infectious and additional care for cancer management might be taken into consideration by precision prevention  therapy or recovery.

Here  we present a comprehensive review of the current literature on the clinical and experimental findings associated with the interrelationship between diabetes and COVID-19. To control disease outcomes and glucometabolic complications in COVID-19  this issue is still being investigated. ABSTRACT: The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  global pandemic  which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   remains uncontrolled  with the spread of emerging variants. According to accumulating evidence  diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for a severe COVID-19 clinical course  depending on the glycemic state before admission and during COVID-19 hospitalization. Multiple factors are thought to be responsible  including an altered immune response  coexisting comorbidity  and disruption of the renin-angiotensin system through the virus–host interaction. However  the precise underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Alternatively  the focus is currently on the diabetogenic and ketosis-prone potential of SARS-CoV-2 itself  even for probable triggers of stress and steroid-induced hyperglycemia in COVID-19. In this article  we present a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the clinical and experimental findings associated with diabetes and COVID-19  and we discuss their bidirectional relationship  i.e.  the risk for an adverse prognosis and the deleterious effects on glycometabolism. Accurate assessments of the incidence of new-onset diabetes induced by COVID-19 and its pathogenicity are still unknown  especially in the context of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants  such as Omicron  B.1.1.529   which is a major challenge for the future.

While single-dose vaccine regimens would provide multiple advantages  two doses may improve the magnitude and durability of immunity and protective efficacy. We assessed one- and two-dose regimens of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate in adult and aged nonhuman primates  NHPs . A two-dose Ad26.COV2.S regimen induced higher peak binding and neutralizing antibody responses compared with a single dose. In one-dose regimens  neutralizing antibody responses were stable for at least 14 wk  providing an early indication of durability. Ad26.COV2.S induced humoral immunity and T helper cell  Th cell  1–skewed cellular responses in aged NHPs that were comparable to those in adult animals. Aged Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated animals challenged 3 mo after dose 1 with a SARS-CoV-2 spike G614 variant showed near complete lower and substantial upper respiratory tract protection for both regimens. Neutralization of variants of concern by NHP sera was reduced for B.1.351 lineages while maintained for the B.1.1.7 lineage independent of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine regimen.

A systematic summary of the landscape of neutralizing antibodies against emerging variants is needed. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed  Embase  Web of Science  and 3 pre-print servers for studies that evaluated neutralizing antibodies titers induced by previous infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 variants and comprehensively collected individual data. We calculated lineage-specific GMTs across different study participants and types of neutralization assays. FINDINGS: We identified 56 studies  including 2 483 individuals and 8 590 neutralization tests  meeting the eligibility criteria. Compared with lineage B  we estimate a 1.5-fold  95% CI: 1.0–2.2  reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7  8.7-fold  95% CI: 6.5–11.7  reduction against B.1.351 and 5.0-fold  95% CI: 4.0–6.2  reduction against P.1. The estimated neutralization reductions for B.1.351 compared to lineage B were 240.2-fold  95% CI: 124.0–465.6  reduction for non-replicating vector platform  4.6-fold  95% CI: 4.0–5.2  reduction for RNA platform  and 1.6-fold  95% CI: 1.2–2.1  reduction for protein subunit platform. The neutralizing antibodies induced by administration of inactivated vaccines and mRNA vaccines against lineage P.1 were also remarkably reduced by an average of 5.9-fold  95% CI: 3.7–9.3  and 1.5-fold  95% CI: 1.2–1.9 . INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the antibody response established by natural infection or vaccination might be able to effectively neutralize B.1.1.7  but neutralizing titers against B.1.351 and P.1 suffered large reductions. Standardized protocols for neutralization assays  as well as updating immune-based prevention and treatment  are needed. FUNDING: Chinese National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars

Prions are proteins that possess a unique conformational conversion  with the ability to rapidly shift between multiple conformations due to residue hydrophobicity and net sequence charge  and viral prion-like proteins are known as potential regulators of viral infections. However  the prion-like domains  PrD  in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome have not been analyzed. In this in silico study  using the PLAAC algorithm  we identified the presence of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared with other viruses  a striking difference was observed in the distribution of prion-like domains in the spike protein since SARS-CoV-2 is the only coronavirus with a prion-like domain found in the receptor-binding domain of the S1 region of the spike protein. The presence and unique distribution of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains of the spike protein are particularly interesting since although the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins share the same host cell receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2. We identified prion-like domains in the α1 helix of the ACE2 receptor that interact with the viral receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Finally  we found substantial differences in the prion-like domain of the S1 region of the spike protein across emerging variants including Omicron  B.1.1.529 . Taken together  the present findings indicate that the identified PrDs in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  and ACE2 region that interact with RBD play important functional roles in viral adhesion and entry.

In Switzerland  during the last weeks of December 2020  we established a nationwide screening protocol across multiple laboratories  focusing first on epidemiological and microbiological definitions. In January 2021  we validated and implemented an N501Y-specific PCR to rapidly screen for VoCs  which are then confirmed using amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing  WGS . A total of 13 387 VoCs have been identified since the detection of the first Swiss case in October 2020  with 4194 being B.1.1.7  172 B.1.351  and 7 P.1. The remaining 9014 cases of VoCs have been described without further lineage specification. Overall  all diagnostic centers reported a rapid increase of the percentage of detected VOCs  with a range of 6 to 46% between 25 to 31 of January 2021 increasing towards 41 to 82% between 22 to 28 of February. A total of 739 N501Y positive genomes were analysed and show a broad range of introduction events to Switzerland. In this paper  we describe the nationwide coordination and implementation process across laboratories  public health institutions  and researchers  the first results of our N501Y-specific variant screening  and the phylogenetic analysis of all available WGS data in Switzerland  that together identified the early introduction events and subsequent community spreading of the VoCs.

To identify the new emergent variants  the surveillance of the variants of concern  VOC  and variants of interest  VOI  is ongoing. This study aimed to determine how the transition of viral lineage occurred by stationary genome analysis in Yamanashi  Japan. METHODS: We performed the whole genome sequencing using SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from February 2020 to the end of June 2021. Viral lineage was defined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak  PANGO  lineages. RESULTS: We successfully obtained 325 viral genome sequences and the number of analyzed samples accounted for 15.4% of the total 2109 COVID-19 patients identified in our district. We identified 13 types of viral lineages including R.1  P.1  B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.617.2  Delta . These virus lineages had distinct periods of expansion and decline. After the emerging of the R.1 lineage harboring E484K variant  designated VOI in Japan   the prevalent B.1.1.214 lineage were no longer identified. The R.1 lineages were temporarily prevalent afterwards  but the influx of B.1.1.7 lineage  designated VOC  led to a decline in R.1. Currently  B.1.1.7 has become dominant after mid-April 2021. CONCLUSION: We clearly elucidated the transition and replacement of viral lineage by the community-based analysis. The virus completely replaced by more infectious lineages  therefore  it will be necessary to continue to monitor the VOC and VOI.

However  the dynamics of viral transmission in this setting remain incompletely understood. We describe the clinical and viral-phylogenetic characteristics of a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a high attack rate  and explore how whole-genome sequencing  WGS  can inform outbreak investigations in this context. In this cluster  the first symptomatic case was a 22-month-old infant who developed rhinorrhoea and sneezing 2 days prior to attending a family gathering. Subsequently  seven family members in attendance at this event were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections  including the infant described. WGS revealed indistinguishable SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from the adults at the gathering  which were closely related genetically to B.1 lineage viruses circulating in the local community. However  a divergent viral sub-lineage was recovered from the infant and another child  each harbouring a distinguishing spike substitution  N30S . This suggested that the infant was unlikely to be the primary case  despite displaying symptoms first  and additional analysis of her nasopharyngeal swab revealed a picornavirus co-infection to account for her early symptoms. Our findings demonstrate how WGS can elucidate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections within household clusters and provide useful information to support outbreak investigations. Additionally  our description of SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages and notable variants circulating in Ireland to date provides an important genomic-epidemiological baseline in the context of vaccine introduction.

The B.1.617.2 variant has a potentially higher rate of transmission than other variants  2 . During May 12-18  2021  the Oklahoma State Department of Health  OSDH  Acute Disease Service  ADS  was notified by the OSDH Public Health Laboratory  PHL  of 21 SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 specimens temporally and geographically clustered in central Oklahoma. Public health surveillance data indicated that these cases were associated with a local gymnastics facility  facility A . OSDH ADS and local health department staff members reinterviewed persons with B.1.617.2 variant-positive laboratory results and conducted contact tracing. Forty-seven COVID-19 cases  age range = 5-58 years   including 21 laboratory-confirmed B.1.617.2 variant and 26 epidemiologically linked cases  were associated with this outbreak during April 15-May 3  2021. Cases occurred among 10 of 16 gymnast cohorts* and three staff members; secondary cases occurred in seven  33%  of 26 interviewed households with outbreak-associated cases. The overall facility and household attack rates were 20% and 53%  respectively. Forty  85%  persons with outbreak-associated COVID-19 had never received any COVID-19 vaccine doses  unvaccinated ; three  6%  had received 1 dose of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech &#8805;14 days before a positive test result but had not received the second dose  partially vaccinated ; four persons  9%  had received 2 doses of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech or a single dose of Janssen  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine &#8805;14 days before a positive test result  fully vaccinated . These findings suggest that the B.1.617.2 variant is highly transmissible in indoor sports settings and within households. Multicomponent prevention strategies including vaccination remain important to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2  including among persons participating in indoor sports and their contacts.

Approaches to this task have been varied  relying on differing sequencing methods and computational analyses. We used a novel computation workflow based on amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 spike domains in order to track viral populations in wastewater. As part of this workflow  we developed a program  SAM Refiner  that has a variety of outputs  including novel variant reporting as well as functions designed to remove polymerase chain reaction  PCR  generated chimeric sequences. With these methods  we were able to track viral population dynamics over time. We report here on the emergence of two variants of concern  B.1.1.7  Alpha  and P.1  Gamma   and their displacement of the D614G B.1 variant in a Missouri sewershed.

Animal models can be used to assess phenotypical changes in the absence of confounding factors. Here  we compared variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to a recent B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G spike substitution in the rhesus macaque model. B.1.1.7 behaved similarly to D614G with respect to clinical disease and replication in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with B.1.351 resulted in lower clinical scores  lower lung virus titers  and less severe lung lesions. In bronchoalveolar lavages  cytokines and chemokines were up-regulated on day 4 in animals inoculated with D614G and B.1.1.7 but not with B.1.351. In nasal samples  cytokines and chemokines were up-regulated only in the B.1.1.7-inoculated animals. Together  our study suggests that circulation under diverse evolutionary pressures favors transmissibility and immune evasion rather than increased pathogenicity.

Using a clinical strain of the Omicron variant  we analyzed the neutralizing power of eight currently used monoclonal antibodies compared to the ancestral B.1 BavPat1 D614G strain. We observed that six of these antibodies have lost their ability to neutralize the Omicron variant. Of the antibodies still having neutralizing activity  Sotrovimab Vir-7831 shows the smallest reduction in activity  with a factor change of 3.1. Cilgavimab AZD1061 alone shows a reduction in efficacy of 15.8  resulting in a significant loss of activity for the Evusheld cocktail  42.6-fold reduction  in which the other antibody  Tixagevimab  does not retain significant activity against Omicron. Our results suggest that the clinical efficacy of the initially proposed doses should be rapidly evaluated and the possible need to modify doses or propose combination therapies should be considered.

Human natural defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Serine proteases  SPs  including furin and TMPRSS2 cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  facilitating viral entry. Here  we show that FXa  a SP for blood coagulation  is upregulated in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 donors and exerts anti-viral activity. Mechanistically  FXa cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  which prevents its binding to ACE2  and thus blocks viral entry. Furthermore  the variant B.1.1.7 with several mutations is dramatically resistant to the anti-viral effect of FXa compared to wild-type SARA-CoV-2 in vivo and in vitro. The anti-coagulant rivaroxaban directly inhibits FXa and facilitates viral entry  whereas the indirect inhibitor fondaparinux does not. In a lethal humanized hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2  FXa prolonged survival while combination with rivaroxaban but not fondaparinux abrogated this protection. These preclinical results identify a previously unknown SP function and associated anti-viral host defense mechanism and suggest caution in considering direct inhibitors for prevention or treatment of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed  recovered COVID-19 convalescent individuals  n = 30  infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 +  T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-major histocompatibility complex tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8 +  T cells in these individuals  n = 52 distinct epitopes  are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC  n = 50 mutations . Within this population  only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein  restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2 30  7%  individuals  contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 +  T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.

Several recent SARS-CoV-2 variants are more transmissible and evade infection- or vaccine-induced protection. We constructed live attenuated vaccine candidates by large-scale recoding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and showed that the lead candidate  designated sCPD9  protects Syrian hamsters from a challenge with ancestral virus. Here  we assessed immunogenicity and protective efficacy of sCPD9 in the Roborovski dwarf hamster  a nontransgenic rodent species that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19–like disease. We show that a single intranasal vaccination with sCPD9 elicited strong cross-neutralizing antibody responses against four current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   B.1.1.28.1  Gamma   and B.1.617.2  Delta .

Methods: Since the onset of the pandemic  more than 2 700 SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory samples have been randomly selected and sequenced in the Balearic Islands. Genetic diversity of circulating variants was assessed by lineage assignment of consensus whole genome sequences with PANGOLIN and investigation of additional spike mutations. Results: Consensus sequences were assigned to 46 different PANGO lineages and 75% of genomes were classified within a VOC  VUI  or VUM variant according to the WHO definitions. Highest genetic diversity was documented in the island of Majorca  42 different lineages detected . Globally  lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 AY.X were identified as the 2 major lineages circulating in the Balearic Islands during the pandemic  distantly followed by lineages B.1.177 B.1.177.X. However  in Ibiza Formentera lineage distribution was slightly different and lineage B.1.221 was the third most prevalent. Temporal distribution analysis showed that B.1 and B.1.5 lineages dominated the first epidemic wave  lineage B.1.177 dominated the second and third  and lineage B.1.617.2 the fourth. Of note  lineage B.1.1.7 became the most prevalent circulating lineage during first half of 2021; however  it was not associated with an increased in COVID-19 cases likely due to severe social restrictions and limited travels. Additional spike mutations were rarely documented with the exception of mutation S:Q613H which has been detected in several genomes  n = 25  since July 2021. Conclusion: Virus evolution  mainly driven by the acquisition and selection of spike substitutions conferring biological advantages  social restrictions  and size population are apparently key factors for explaining the epidemic patterns registered in the Balearic Islands.

Here  we performed a high-resolution multiplex  16-plex  surrogate virus neutralization assay covering all major SARS-CoV-2 variants and pre-emergent ACE2-binding sarbecoviruses against 20 different human serum panels from infected  vaccinated and hybrid immune individuals which had vaccine-breakthrough infections or infection followed by vaccination. Among all sarbecoviruses tested  we observed 1.1 to 4.7-  2.3 to 10.3- and 0.7 to 33.3-fold reduction in neutralization activities to SARS-CoV-2 Beta  Omicron and SARS-CoV-1  respectively. Among the SARS-CoV-2 related sarbecoviruses  it is found that the genetically more distant bat RaTG13 and pangolin GX-P5L sarbecoviruses had less neutralization escape than Omicron. Our data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged from the changed immune landscape of human populations are more potent in escaping neutralizing antibodies  from infection or vaccination  than pre-emergent sarbecoviruses naturally evolved in animal populations with no or less immune selection pressure.

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 lineage was first identified in South Africa  2  and might be neutralized less effectively by antibodies produced after vaccination or natural infection with other strains  3-6 . To limit SARS-CoV-2 chains of transmission associated with this index patient  MDH used contact tracing to identify the source of infection and any linked infections among other persons. The investigation identified two linked clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection that included 17 patients. Three additional specimens from these clusters were sequenced; all three had the B.1.351 variant and all sequences were closely related to the sequence from the index patient's specimen. Among the 17 patients identified  none reported recent international travel or contact with international travelers. Two patients  including the index patient  had received the first of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination series in the 2 weeks before their likely exposure; one additional patient had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 5 months before exposure. Two patients were hospitalized with COVID-19  and one died. These first identified linked clusters of B.1.351 infections in the United States with no apparent link to international travel highlight the importance of expanding the scope and volume of genetic surveillance programs to identify variants  completing contact investigations for SARS-CoV-2 infections  and using universal prevention strategies  including vaccination  masking  and physical distancing  to control the spread of variants of concern.

However  because of the lifting of international travel restrictions  amid the many uncertainties induced by the emerging B.1.1.529 variant  it remains unclear about the timeline of reaching herd immunity and when our daily life will return to normalcy. Since access to a vaccine is an important predicate to the achievement of herd immunity  we articulate the vaccine access issue as the degree of fit between patients and the healthcare system in five dimensions: availability  accessibility  accommodation  affordability  and acceptability. These five dimensions can be adopted in existing health practice and policy to elucidate effective strategies for raising COVID-19 vaccination rates and improving vaccine equity in the fight against the new variant.

The B.1.1.28 lineage has been evolving in Brazil since February 2020 and originated the P.1 variant of concern  VOC   recently named as the Gamma variant by the newly WHO nomenclature proposal  and P.2 as a variant of interest  VOI . Here we describe an early case of P.1 primary infection in Southern Brazil in late November 2020  soon after the emergence of the variant in Manaus  Northern Brazil. The same male patient was reinfected by another B.1.1.28 variant  namely P.2  in March  2021. The genomic analysis confirmed genetically significant differences between the two viruses recovered in both infections  the P.1 lineage in the first episode and P.2 in the reinfection. Due the very early detection of P.1  we have also investigated the circulation of P.1 in the same region by differential RT-qPCR  showing that this was an isolated case of P.1 at the time of detection  and this variant has disseminated and became prominent from late January to the end of March  2021. SARS-CoV-2 recent reports of reinfection have raised critical questions on whether and how well a first infection protects against reinfection.

Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody  NAb  responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However  little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study  we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain  RBD  and N-terminal domain  NTD  binding antibodies  homologous NAb titers  and membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on the cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses. IMPORTANCE Widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. NAb responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However  SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virological  immunological  and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Here  we developed a rapid test  termed CoVariant-SCAN  that detects neutralizing antibodies  nAbs  capable of blocking interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and the spike protein of wild-type  WT  SARS-CoV-2 and three other variants: B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. Using CoVariant-SCAN  we assessed neutralization blocking of monoclonal antibodies and plasma from COVID-19–positive and vaccinated individuals. For several monoclonal antibodies and most plasma samples  neutralization against B.1.351 and P.1 variants is diminished relative to WT  while B.1.1.7 is largely cross-neutralized. We also showed that we can rapidly adapt the platform to detect nAbs against an additional variant—B.1.617.2  Delta —without reengineering or reoptimizing the assay. Results using CoVariant-SCAN are consistent with live virus neutralization assays and demonstrate that this easy-to-deploy test could be used to rapidly assess nAb response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Public health departments identified primary and secondary cases by using coronavirus disease surveillance data  case investigations  and contact tracing. A primary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2 detected <14 days after travel to or residence in Provincetown during July 3–17. A secondary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2 detected <14 days after close contact with a person who had a primary case but without travel to or residence in Provincetown during July 3–August 10. We identified 1 098 primary cases and 30 secondary cases associated with 26 primary cases among fully and non–fully vaccinated persons. Large gatherings can have widespread effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission  and fully vaccinated persons should take precautions  such as masking  to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission  particularly during substantial or high transmission.

In this study among school contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive children in 43 contact-investigations  we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Norway  August 2020–May 2021. All participants were tested twice within seven to ten days  using SARS-CoV-2 PCR on home-sampled saliva. Positive samples were whole genome sequenced. Among the 559 child contacts  eight tested positive  1.4%  95% CI 0.62–2.80   with no significant difference between primary  1.0%  95% CI 0.27–2.53  and secondary schools  2.6%  95% CI 0.70–6.39   p = 0.229  nor by viral strain  non-Alpha  1.4%  95% CI 0.50–2.94  and Alpha variant  B.1.1.7   1.7%  95% CI 0.21–5.99   p = 0.665. One adult contact  1 100  tested positive. In 34 index cases  we detected 13 different SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineage variants  with B.1.1.7 being most frequent. In the eight contact-investigations with SARS-CoV-2 positive contacts  four had the same sequence identity as the index  one had no relation  and three were inconclusive. With mitigation measures in place  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from children in schools is limited. By excluding contact-investigations with adult cases known at the time of enrolment  our data provide a valid estimate on the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants  particularly those deemed VOC Is: B.1.351  B.1.1.7  and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases  as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7  first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1  originating from Brazil; and B.1.351  first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility  by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation  which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies  leading to partial immune escape  favoring reinfections  and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore  the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk  lowered when using multiplex assays   as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance  many new VOC Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing  vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans  and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.

These conditions could be complicated by concomitant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection as in the case herein described. A young amateur soccer player died in late October 2020 after a fatal arrhythmia and the autopsy revealed the presence of HCM with diffuse non-obstructive coronary disease. The molecular autopsy revealed a compound condition with a first mutation in the MYH7 gene  p.Arg719Trp  and a second mutation in the LDLR gene  p.Gly343Cys : both have already been described as associated with HCM and HeFH  respectively. In addition  molecular analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7  UK variant with high titer in the myocardium. Co-segregation analysis within the family  n = 19  showed that heterozygous LDLR mutation was maternally inherited  while the heterozygous MYH7 genetic lesion was de novo. All family member carriers of the LDLR mutation  n = 13  had systematic higher LDL plasma concentrations and positive records of cardiac and vascular ischemic events at young age. Considering that HCM mutations are in themselves involved in the predisposition to malignant arrhythmogenicity and HeFH could cause higher risk of cardiac complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection  this case could represent an example of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection role in triggering or unmasking inherited cardiovascular disease  whose combination might represent the cause of fatal arrhythmia at such a young age. Additionally  it can provide clues in dating the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Northern Italy in the early phases of the second pandemic wave.

However  it is unknown if antibodies elicited by infection with these variants target the same or different regions of the viral spike as antibodies elicited by earlier viral isolates. Here we compare the specificities of polyclonal antibodies produced by humans infected with early 2020 isolates versus the B.1.351 variant of concern  also known as Beta or 20H 501Y.V2   which contains mutations in multiple key spike epitopes. The serum neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by infection with both early 2020 viruses and B.1.351 is heavily focused on the spike receptor-binding domain  RBD . However  within the RBD  B.1.351-elicited antibodies are more focused on the “class 3” epitope spanning sites 443 to 452  and neutralization by these antibodies is notably less affected by mutations at residue 484. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 variants can elicit polyclonal antibodies with different immunodominance hierarchies.

Here  we evaluated performance characteristics of TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 mutation panel genotyping molecular assay for detection of most common reported SARS-CoV-2 variants using specific RT-PCR assays targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNP . PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 150 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from March to July were included for this study. In addition  five controls comprised of synthetic RNA B.1.1.7_601443  B.1.351_678597  P.1_792683  B.1.617.1_1662307 and MN908947.3-Wuhan-hu-1 from Twist bioscience and B.1.1.7  England 204820464 2020  and B.1.351  South Africa KRISP-K005325 2020  from Zeptometrix  NY  USA were used for validation. Total RNA from specimens was extracted using Omega Bio-Tek Mag-Bind Viral RNA Xpress Extraction Kit and tested for known SARS-CoV2 variants using ThermoFisher TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 mutation panel molecular assay on the QuantStudio 12K Flex. Nine representative samples have been compared with sequencing. Data were analyzed by genotype calling using QuantStudio™ design and analysis software v 2.5 with the genotyping analysis module. RESULTS: All validation controls were tested in triplicate and repeated in singlet on three different days and all reported variants were matched as expected. Out of 150 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens  69  46%  were B.1.617.2  49  32.7%  were B.1.1.7  P.1 and P.2 were 4  2.7%  each and B.1.351 and B.1.427 B.1429 were 2  1.3%  each. Three  2%  were B.1.526  and 17  11.3%  have a mutation in D614G. Genotyping results from the present study showing B.1.617.2  B.1.1.7  and B.1.526 variants and their mutation genes were concordant with sequencing results.

An understanding of the immune response that is predictive of protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines. Data from a randomized efficacy trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  AZD1222  vaccine in the United Kingdom was analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and noninfected vaccine recipients. Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. A vaccine efficacy of 80% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 264  95% CI: 108  806  binding antibody units  BAU  ml: and 506  95% CI: 135  not computed  beyond data range   NC   BAU ml for anti-spike and anti-RBD antibodies  and 26  95% CI: NC  NC  international unit  IU  ml and 247  95% CI: 101  NC  normalized neutralization titers  NF 50   for pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization  respectively. Immune markers were not correlated with asymptomatic infections at the 5% significance level. These data can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays  and allow extrapolation of efficacy estimates to new COVID-19 vaccines.

METHODS: We first tested SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell  CοV-2-ST  immunity and expansion in unexposed donors  COVID-19 infected individuals  convalescent   asymptomatic PCR-positive subjects  vaccinated individuals  non-ICU hospitalized patients and ICU patients who either recovered and were discharged  ICU recovered  or had a prolonged stay and or died  ICU critical . CoV-2-STs were generated from all types of donors and underwent phenotypic and functional assessment. RESULTS: We demonstrate causal relationship between the expansion of endogenous CoV-2-STs and the disease outcome; insufficient expansion of circulating CoV-2-STs  identified hospitalized patients at high-risk for an adverse outcome. CoV-2-STs with a similarly functional and non-alloreactive  albeit highly cytotoxic  profile against SARS-CoV-2 could be expanded from both convalescent and vaccinated donors generating clinical-scale  SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell products with functional activity against both the unmutated virus and its B.1.1.7 variant. In contrast  critical COVID-19 patient-originating CoV-2-STs failed to expand  recapitulating the in vivo failure of CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity to control the infection. CoV-2-STs generated from asymptomatic PCR+ individuals presented only weak responses whereas their counterparts originating from exposed to other seasonal coronaviruses subjects failed to kill the virus  thus disempowering the hypothesis of protective cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall  we provide evidence on risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the feasibility of generating powerful CoV-2-ST products from both convalescent and vaccinated donors as an “off-the shelf” T-cell immunotherapy for high-risk patients.

Here  we describe a human monoclonal antibody  mAb   designated S2X259  recognizing a highly conserved cryptic receptor-binding domain  RBD  epitope and cross-reacting with spikes from all sarbecovirus clades. S2X259 broadly neutralizes spike-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 including the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.427 B.1.429 VOC  as well as a wide spectrum of human and zoonotic sarbecoviruses through inhibition of ACE2 binding to the RBD. Furthermore  deep-mutational scanning and in vitro escape selection experiments demonstrate that S2X259 possesses a remarkably high barrier to the emergence of resistance mutants. We show that prophylactic administration of S2X259 protects Syrian hamsters against challenges with the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant  suggesting this mAb is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of emergent VOC and zoonotic infections. Our data unveil a key antigenic site targeted by broadly-neutralizing antibodies and will guide the design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.

METHODS: We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta  B.1.617.2  variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech   ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  AstraZeneca   or mRNA-1273  Moderna  vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  or mRNA-1273. RESULTS: Between November 27  2021  and January 12  2022  a total of 886 774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant  204 154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant  and 1 572 621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines  vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses  whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5%  95% confidence interval [CI]  63.9 to 67.0  at 2 to 4 weeks  dropping to 8.8%  95% CI  7.0 to 10.5  at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients  vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4%  95% CI  61.8 to 63.0  at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6%  95% CI  38.0 to 41.1  at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients  vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2%  95% CI  66.5 to 67.8  at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7%  95% CI  44.7 to 46.7  at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1%  95% CI  69.5 to 70.7  at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9%  95% CI  59.7 to 62.1  at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course  the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9%  95% CI  73.1 to 74.6  at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4%  95% CI  62.6 to 66.1  at 5 to 9 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Primary immunization with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster after either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 primary course substantially increased protection  but that protection waned over time.

The B.1.351 variant carrying the escape mutation E484K in the receptor binding domain is of particular concern due to reduced immunological protection following vaccination. Protection can manifest as early as 10 days following immunization with full protection two weeks following the second dose  but the course is not well-characterized for variants. Here  we investigated the immune transcriptome of six elderly individuals  average age 82 yr.  from an old peopleâ€™s home  who contracted B.1.351  with four having received the first dose of BNT162b eight to 11 days prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patients were hospitalized and received dexamethasone treatment. Immune transcriptomes were established from PBMCs approximately 10 and 35 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptomology. RNA-seq revealed a more intensive immune response in vaccinated patients as compared to unvaccinated ones. Specifically  transcription factors linked to the JAK STAT pathway  interferon stimulated genes  and genes associated with innate antiviral immunity and COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2 infection were highly enriched in vaccinated patients. This rendered the transcriptomes of the older vaccinated group significantly different than older unvaccinated individuals infected at the same institution and more similar to the immune response of younger unvaccinated individuals  ages 48-62  following B.1.351 infection. All individuals in this study whether vaccinated or not were hospitalized due to B.1.351 infection and one vaccinated patient died illustrating that although an enhanced immune response was documented infection it was insufficient to protect from disease. This highlights the need for maintaining physical distancing and prevention measures throughout the time course of vaccination in older adults.

We report the emergence and spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant within the B.1.575 lineage  containing the E484K mutation in the spike protein  named B.1.575.2   in a region in northern Spain in May and June 2021. SARS-CoV-2-positive samples with cycle threshold values of ≤30 were selected to screen for presumptive variants using the TaqPath coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  reverse transcription  RT -PCR kit and the TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 mutation panel. Confirmation of variants was performed by whole-genome sequencing. Of the 200 samples belonging to the B.1.575 lineage  194  97%  corresponded to the B.1.575.2 sublineage  which was related to the presence of the E484K mutation. Of 197 cases registered in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data  GISAID  EpiCoV database as lineage B.1.575.2  194  99.5%  were identified in Pamplona  Spain. This report emphasizes the importance of complementing surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 with sequencing for the rapid control of emerging viral variants.

Here  to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Bangladesh at the national level  we analysed outbreak trajectory and variant emergence using genomics  Facebook ‘Data for Good’ and data from three mobile phone operators. We sequenced the complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples  collected by the IEDCR in Bangladesh between March and July 2020  and combined these data with 324 publicly available Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data  GISAID  SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh at that time. We found that most  85%  of the sequenced isolates were Pango lineage B.1.1.25  58%   B.1.1  19%  or B.1.36  8%  in early-mid 2020. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted that SARS-CoV-2 first emerged during mid-February in Bangladesh  from abroad  with the first case of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  reported on 8 March 2020. At the end of March 2020  three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity in Bangladesh  combined with the mobility data  revealed that the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March  followed by frequent travel between Dhaka  the capital of Bangladesh  and the rest of the country  disseminated three dominant viral lineages. Further analysis of an additional 85 genomes  November 2020 to April 2021  found that importation of variant of concern Beta  B.1.351  had occurred and that Beta had become dominant in Dhaka. Our interpretation that population mobility out of Dhaka  and travel from urban hotspots to rural areas  disseminated lineages in Bangladesh in the first wave continues to inform government policies to control national case numbers by limiting within-country travel.

Rapid identification of such variants is important for the public health decision making and to provide valuable data for epidemiological and policy decision making. We developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  assay that can specifically identify and differentiate between the emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SC-2 variants. In a single assay  we combined four reactions—one that detects SC-2 RNA independently of the strain  one that detects the D3L mutation  which is specific to variant B.1.1.7  one that detects the 242 to 244 deletion  which is specific to variant B.1.351  and the fourth reaction  which identifies the human RNAseP gene  serving as an endogenous control for RNA extraction integrity. We show that the strain-specific reactions target mutations that are strongly associated with the target variants and not with other major known variants. The assay’s specificity was tested against a panel of respiratory pathogens  n = 16   showing high specificity toward SC-2 RNA. The assay’s sensitivity was assessed using both in vitro transcribed RNA and clinical samples and was determined to be between 20 and 40 viral RNA copies per reaction. The assay performance was corroborated with Sanger and whole-genome sequencing  showing complete agreement with the sequencing results. The new assay is currently implemented in the routine diagnostic work at the Central Virology Laboratory  and may be used in other laboratories to facilitate the diagnosis of these major worldwide-circulating SC-2 variants. IMPORTANCE This study describes the design and utilization of a multiplex reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  to identify SARS-COV-2  SC2  RNA in general and  specifically  to detect whether it is of lineage B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. Implementation of this method in diagnostic and research laboratories worldwide may help the efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The method can be easily scaled up and be used in high-throughput laboratories  as well as small ones. In addition to immediate help in diagnostic efforts  this method may also help in epidemiological studies focused on the spread of emerging SC-2 lineages.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed  recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients  n=30  infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals  n=52 distinct epitopes  are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC  n=50 mutations . Within this population  only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2 30  7%  individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC  and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.

This offered a rare opportunity to study the ecology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the ongoing pandemic. Here  we use population genetic and phylogenetic methodology to characterize the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstruct patterns of virus introductions and local transmission in Norway against this backdrop. The analyses demonstrated that the epidemic in Norway was largely import driven and characterized by the repeated introduction  establishment  and suppression of new transmission lineages. This pattern changed with the arrival of the B.1.1.7 lineage  which was able to establish a stable presence concomitant with the imposition of severe border restrictions.

It is one of the most mutating virus in the world. These mutations are responsible for the appearance of new variants  the most recent of which is Omicron  line B.1.1.529 . This new variant was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. The main fear with this variant is that of an immune escape and ineffectiveness of vaccines currently available. OBJECTIVE: We studied the response of our immune system and the effectiveness of current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC. METHODS: We carried out a narrative review from 32 scientific articles from databases: MEDLINE  PubMed   Embase  BioRxiv and MedRxiv. RESULTS: Faced with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC: The humoral immune response decreased  while the cellular immune response was preserved. The booster vaccine provided protection against symptomatic or non-symptomatic infections  transmission  and serious forms. CONCLUSION: In the end  according to these data  the 3rd dose appears to be the solution to be able to defeat SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC. But the health authorities must not forget to insist on the primary vaccination of individuals not yet vaccinated  as well as on an ""equal"" distribution of vaccines against COVID-19 throughout the world."

Here  we investigate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  AZD1222  against symptomatic COVID-19 in a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a Phase 3 randomised trial in Brazil  trial registration ISRCTN89951424 . Nose and throat swabs were tested by PCR in symptomatic participants. Sequencing and genotyping of swabs were performed to determine the lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating during the study. Protection against any symptomatic COVID-19 caused by the Zeta  P.2  variant was assessed in 153 cases with vaccine efficacy  VE  of 69%  95% CI 55  78 . 49 cases of B.1.1.28 occurred and VE was 73%  46  86 . The Gamma  P.1  variant arose later in the trial and fewer cases  N = 18  were available for analysis. VE was 64%  −2  87 . ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 provided 95% protection  95% CI 61%  99%  against hospitalisation due to COVID-19. In summary  we report that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 protects against emerging variants in Brazil despite the presence of the spike protein mutation E484K.

We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance  hospital admission  or death in a large national cohort. METHODS: Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29  2021  and Jan 9  2022  were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status  hospital attendance and admission  and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days  or death within 28 days after confirmed infection  was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date  10-year age band  ethnicity  residential region  and vaccination status  and were further adjusted for sex  index of multiple deprivation decile  evidence of a previous infection  and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta  ie  the relative risk in unvaccinated cases . FINDINGS: The adjusted hazard ratio  HR  of hospital attendance  not necessarily resulting in admission  with omicron compared with delta was 0·56  95% CI 0·54–0·58 ; for hospital admission and death  HR estimates were 0·41  0·39–0·43  and 0·31  0·26–0·37   respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1·10  0·85–1·42  in those younger than 10 years  decreasing to 0·25  0·21–0·30  in 60–69-year-olds  and then increasing to 0·47  0·40–0·56  in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants  past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated  HR 0·47 [0·32–0·68]  and unvaccinated  0·18 [0·06–0·57]  cases. In vaccinated cases  past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination  HR 0·96 [0·88–1·04] ; however  for unvaccinated cases  past infection gave moderate protection  HR 0·55 [0·48–0·63] . Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission  0·30 [0·28–0·32]  in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases  HR for hospital admission 8–11 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0·22 [0·20–0·24]   with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. INTERPRETATION: The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta  with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity  in unvaccinated individuals  counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals  but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.

Recent history involving SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks  SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV  have demonstrated the significant role of intermediate and reservoir hosts in viral maintenance and transmission cycles. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species has been demonstrated  and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer  Odocoileus virginianus  are amongst the most abundant  densely populated  and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the United States. Human interaction with white-tailed deer has resulted in the occurrence of disease in human populations in the past. Recently  white-tailed deer fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study  we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult white-tailed deer. In addition  we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates  representatives of the ancestral lineage A  SARS-CoV-2 human USA WA1 2020  and the alpha variant of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  SARS-CoV-2 human USA CA_CDC_5574 2020   through co-infection of white-tailed deer. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult white-tailed deer are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally  we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in white-tailed deer  as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals  and from virus present in tissues of principal infected deer  fetuses and contact animals.

Here  we identified 45 point mutations that Omicron acquired since divergence from the B.1.1 lineage. We found that the Omicron spike protein sequence was subjected to stronger positive selection than that of any reported SARS-CoV-2 variants known to evolve persistently in human hosts  suggesting a possibility of host-jumping. The molecular spectrum of mutations  i.e.  the relative frequency of the 12 types of base substitutions  acquired by the progenitor of Omicron was significantly different from the spectrum for viruses that evolved in human patients  but resembled the spectra associated with virus evolution in a mouse cellular environment. Furthermore  mutations in the Omicron spike protein significantly overlapped with SARS-CoV-2 mutations known to promote adaptation to mouse hosts  particularly through enhanced spike protein binding affinity for the mouse cell entry receptor. Collectively  our results suggest that the progenitor of Omicron jumped from humans to mice  rapidly accumulated mutations conducive to infecting that host  then jumped back into humans  indicating an inter-species evolutionary trajectory for the Omicron outbreak.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum neutralizing activity of three cohorts. METHODS: : BNT162b2-elicited serum  N=103   candidates as hyper-immune plasma donors  N=90  and patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant  N=22  were enrolled. Three strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been tested: 20A.EU1  B.1.1.7  alpha  and P.1  gamma . Neutralizing antibodies  NT-Abs  titers against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. RESULTS: : B.1.1.7 and P.1 are less efficiently neutralized by convalescent wild-type infected serums if compared to 20A.EU1 strain  mean titer 1.6 and 6.7-fold lower respectively . BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera show an equivalent neutralization potency on the B.1.1.7 but it is significantly lower for the P.1 variant  mean titer 3.3-fold lower . Convalescent P.1 patients are less protected from other SARS-CoV-2 strains with an important reduction of neutralizing antibodies against 20A.EU1 and B.1.1.7  about 12.2 and 10.9-fold  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: : BNT162b2 vaccine confers immunity against all the tested VOCs  while previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may be less protective.

Most of the existing RBD‐targeting neutralizing antibodies block the receptor‐binding motif  RBM   a mutable region with the potential to generate neutralization escape mutants. Here  we isolated and structurally characterized a non‐RBM‐targeting monoclonal antibody  FD20  from convalescent patients. FD20 engages the RBD at an epitope distal to the RBM with a K  D  of 5.6 nM  neutralizes SARS‐CoV‐2 including the current Variants of Concern such as B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617.2  Delta   displays modest cross‐reactivity against SARS‐CoV  and reduces viral replication in hamsters. The epitope coincides with a predicted “ideal” vulnerability site with high functional and structural constraints. Mutation of the residues of the conserved epitope variably affects FD20‐binding but confers little or no resistance to neutralization. Finally  in vitro mode‐of‐action characterization and negative‐stain electron microscopy suggest a neutralization mechanism by which FD20 destructs the Spike. Our results reveal a conserved vulnerability site in the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike for the development of potential antiviral drugs.

The virus caused the disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 . Over 4 million deaths blame COVID-19 during the last one year and 8 months in the world. Currently  four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are mainly focused by pandemic studies with limited experiments to translate the infectivity and pathogenicity of each variant. The SARS-CoV-2 α  β  γ  and δ variant of concern was originated from United Kingdom  South Africa  Brazil Japan  and India  respectively. The classification of SARS-CoV-2 variant is based on the mutation in spike  S  gene on the envelop of SARS-CoV-2. This review describes four SARS-CoV-2 α  β  γ  and δ variants of concern including SARS-CoV-2 ε  ζ  η  ι  κ  and B.1.617.3 variants of interest and alert. Recently  SARS-CoV-2 δ variant prevails over different countries that have 3 unique mutation sites: E156del R158G in the N-terminal domain and T478K in a crucial receptor binding domain. A particular mutation in the functional domain of the S gene is probably associated with the infectivity and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.

In this study  we have performed molecular characterization of SARS-COV-2 circulating in India between January 2020 and May 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-COV-2 reported in the first and second waves of the outbreak showed the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-COV-2 that was dispersed across the evolutionary tree of SARS-COV-2 with six major next strain clades: 19A  5.3%   20A  29.9%   20B  24.9%   20I-Alpha  V1  7.4%   21A-Delta  17.2%   and 21B-Kappa  12.7% . Among the observed clades  21A-Delta and 21B-Kappa belonging to the B.1.617 and its sublineages are the two notable clades that dominated approximately 78% of the total SARS-COV-2 genomes reported during April and May 2021. This study has also established a link between different SARS-COV-2 variants and risk of mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic using multivariable logistic regression model for patient-level data. The estimated model demonstrates that the risk of mortality of the COVID 19 patients infected by variant B.1.617 and or its sublineages is much higher than the other preexisting SARS-COV-2 variants  especially among individuals over 45 years of age  regardless of gender. Considering the transmissibility of the B.1.617 and its sublineages and its potential impact to the public health  real-time analysis of COVID-19 cases coupled with stringent genomics surveillance are promising tools to develop and adapt stringent measures to contain and reduce the impact of SARS-COV-2.

This medicinal plant is effective against multiple pathogens and is used by many global communities as a source of artemisinin derivatives that are first-line drugs to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium parasites. AIM OF THE STUDY: The SARS-CoV-2  Covid-19  global pandemic has killed millions and evolved numerous variants  with delta being the most transmissible to date and causing break-through infections of vaccinated individuals. We further queried the efficacy of A. annua cultivars against new variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 cells  we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L. extracts of four cultivars  A3  BUR  MED  and SAM  to determine their efficacy against five infectious variants of the virus: alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   gamma  P.1   delta  B.1.617.2   and kappa  B.1.617.1 . RESULTS: In addition to being effective against the original wild type  WT  WA1  A. annua cultivars A3  BUR  MED  and SAM were also potent against all five variants. IC 50  and IC 90  values based on measured artemisinin content ranged from 0.3 to 8.4 μM and 1.4–25.0 μM  respectively. The IC 50  and IC 90  values based on dried leaf weight  DW  used to make the tea infusions ranged from 11.0 to 67.7 μg DW and 59.5–160.6 μg DW  respectively. Cell toxicity was insignificant at a leaf dry weight of ≤50 μg in the extract of any cultivar. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts  tea infusions  could potentially provide a cost-effective therapy to help stave off the rapid global spread of these variants  buying time for broader implementation of vaccines.

With the continuous appearance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants  it is imperative to implement tools for genomic surveillance and diagnosis in order to decrease viral transmission and prevalence. The ADSSpike workflow was developed with the goal of identifying signature SNPs from the S gene associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants through amplicon deep sequencing. Seventy-two samples were properly sequenced  and 30 mutations were identified. Among those  signature SNPs were linked to two Zeta-VOI  P.2  samples and one to the Alpha-VOC  B.1.17 . An average depth of 700 reads was found to properly identify all SNPs and deletions pertinent to SARS-CoV-2 mutants. ADSSpike is the first workflow to provide a practical  cost-effective  and scalable solution to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 VOC VOI in the clinical laboratory  adding a valuable tool to public health measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic for approximately $41.85 USD reaction.

Amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant of B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the trimer  A570D and D614G  as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region  N501Y   which comprises the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein. However  the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here  molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements  altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore  we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2  as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface  significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2. Our results demonstrate how mutations found within B.1.1.7 enlarge the flexibility around the fusion peptide and change the RBD–ACE2 interface. We anticipate our findings to be starting points for in depth biochemical and cell biological analyses of B.1.1.7.

We employed a Quadratic Unbounded Binary Optimization  QUBO  model  to search for compounds similar to Remdesivir  RDV   the only antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 currently approved for human use  using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled RDV and compounds present in the DrugBank database as graphs  established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The two methods yielded different lists of compounds  with some overlap. While GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models  the QUBO model predicted BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of cobalamin  also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration  IC 50   values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed cytotoxicity. Lastly  we demonstrated efficacy against several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2  England 02 2020 407073   B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.617.2  Delta . Our data reveal that BMS-986094 and different forms of vitamin B12 are effective at inhibiting replication of all these variants of SARS-CoV-2. While BMS-986094 can cause secondary effects in humans as established by phase II trials  these findings suggest that vitamin B12 deserves consideration as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral  particularly given its extended use and lack of toxicity in humans  and its availability and affordability. Our screening method can be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors  thus providing an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS‐CoV2  genome keeps mutating. In that regard  the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 lineage in the UK has called the attention of global authorities. One point of concern is that if this lineage can be detected by traditional molecular schemes for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection. Herein  we showed that this lineage does not affect the Berlin–Charité protocol but can challenge the available commercial kits directed to the Spike  S  gene. All efforts should be made to continue to monitor SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes for potential variants that can impair diagnostic testing and lead to false negative results.

An open question remains as to whether deficiencies in specific vaccine‐elicited immune responses result in susceptibility to vaccine breakthrough infection. We investigated 55 vaccine breakthrough infection cases  mostly Delta  in Singapore  comparing them against 86 vaccinated close contacts who did not contract infection. Vaccine breakthrough cases showed lower memory B cell frequencies against SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor‐binding domain  RBD . Compared to plasma antibodies  antibodies secreted by memory B cells retained a higher fraction of neutralizing properties against the Delta variant. Inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and TNF were lower in vaccine breakthrough infections than primary infection of similar disease severity  underscoring the usefulness of vaccination in preventing inflammation. This report highlights the importance of memory B cells against vaccine breakthrough and suggests that lower memory B cell levels may be a correlate of risk for Delta vaccine breakthrough infection.

This study aims to investigate the mutations in sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterize the mutation patterns in Egyptian COVID-19 patients during different waves of infection. The samples were collected from 250 COVID-19 patients and the whole genome sequencing was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing. The viral sequence analysis showed 1115 different genome from all Egyptian samples in the second wave mutations including 613 missense mutations  431 synonymous mutations  25 upstream gene mutations  24 downstream gene mutations  10 frame-shift deletions  and 6 stop gained mutation. The Egyptian genomic strains sequenced in second wave of infection are different to that of the first wave. We observe a shift of lineage prevalence from the strain B.1 to B.1.1.1. Only one case was of the new English B.1.1.7. Few samples have one or two mutations of interest from the Brazil and South Africa isolates. New clade 20B appear by March 2020 and 20D appear by May 2020 till January 2021.

Methods: An online  cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21  2020 to January 7  2021. The outcome variables were HCWs' knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage that was recently reported as the UK variant of concern  and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder  GAD-7  score. Results: A total of 1 058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female  59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage  almost all  97.3%  were aware of its emergence  73.8% were aware that it is more infectious  78.0% thought it causes more severe disease  and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this  66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs' most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms  67.0%   and this subgroup was significantly more worried about traveling. Nurses were more worried than physicians  P = 0.001 . Conclusions: Most HCWs were aware of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information  those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake  and those with higher GAD-7 scores. The utilization of official social media platforms could improve accurate information dissemination among HCWs regarding the Pandemic's evolving mutations. Targeted vaccine campaigns are warranted to assure HCWs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines toward SARS-CoV-2 variants.

S is present on virions as prefusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain  RBD  is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here  we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs  including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived  strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern P.1 and B.1.351. Notably  the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different  but equally potent  immune responses than open spikes and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. We suggest that closed spikes  together with their improved stability and storage properties  may be a valuable component of refined  next-generation vaccines. IMPORTANCE Vaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants  as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded. Despite occlusion of the receptor binding site  the spike induces potently neutralizing sera against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antibodies are raised against a different pattern of epitopes to those induced by other spike constructs  preferring conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Closed spikes  or mRNA vaccines based on their sequence  can be a valuable component of next-generation vaccines.

The A.23 viral lineage  characterized by three spike mutations F157L  V367F and Q613H  was first identified in a Ugandan prison in July 2020  and then spilled into the general population adding additional spike mutations  R102I  L141F  E484K and P681R  to comprise lineage A.23.1 by September 2020—with this virus being designated a variant of interest  VOI  in Africa and with subsequent spread to 26 other countries. The P681R spike mutation of the A.23.1 VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as such  this mutation may affect viral replication  transmissibility or pathogenic properties. Here  we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1 S2 sequence from A.23.1 and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin  compared to sequences matching Wuhan-Hu1 S1 S2. We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed an increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells  compared to Wuhan-Hu1  and a lowered infection in Vero E6 cells. However  these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in a P681R point mutant of Wuhan-Hu1 spike. Our findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated cleavage linked to the P681R mutation—which may affect viral infection and transmissibility—this mutation needs to occur on the background of other spike protein changes to enable its functional consequences.

Methods Here  we assessed a cohort of 77 CID patients treated as monotherapy with chronic immunosuppressive drugs for antibody responses in serum against historical and variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses after immunization with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Findings Longitudinal analysis showed the greatest reductions in neutralizing antibodies and Fc effector functions capacity in individuals treated with TNF-α inhibitors  TNFi   and this pattern appeared worse against B.1.617.2 Delta virus. Within five months of vaccination  serum neutralizing titers of all TNFi-treated patients tested fell below the presumed threshold correlate for antibody-mediated protection. However  TNFi-treated patients receiving a third mRNA vaccine dose boosted their serum neutralizing antibody titers by more than 16-fold. Conclusions Thus  vaccine boosting or administration of long-acting prophylaxis  e.g.  monoclonal antibodies  likely will be required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this susceptible population.

While some publications have described the clinical features of adult patients with the B.1.1.7 variant  little information is available on newborn patients. We report the clinical characteristics  treatment and care practices for a 21-day-old newborn patient who was confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Viet Nam during contact tracing after her father was confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The patient displayed no symptoms of COVID-19 on admission but 3 days later developed diarrhoea  vomiting  a runny nose and a productive cough. These symptoms lasted for 3 days before becoming milder for 1 day and then stopping until discharge. During treatment  the patient received Vietnamese traditional herbal peppermint extracts for cough and digestive probiotics for diarrhoeal symptoms. A saltwater solution  Sterimar 0.9%  was used to clean the patient’s sinuses. The patient was cared for and fed breastmilk by her mother  who was provided with personal protective equipment  including sterilized infant equipment  medical masks and hand sanitizer  during hospitalization. The patient’s mother tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 throughout hospitalization. In conclusion  we found no severely abnormal clinical symptoms in a newborn infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 during treatment. Our case suggests that newborn patients with the B.1.1.7 variant can receive exclusive breastmilk feeding if sufficient preventive measures are provided for both mother and child.

Resource limitations  such as available hospital space  staffing  and supplies led some facilities to adopt crisis standards of care  the most extreme operating condition for hospitals  in which the focus of medical decision-making shifted from achieving the best outcomes for individual patients to addressing the immediate care needs of larger groups of patients  3 . When hospitals deviated from conventional standards of care  many preventive and elective procedures were suspended  leading to the progression of serious conditions among some persons who would have benefitted from earlier diagnosis and intervention  4 . During March-May 2020  U.S. emergency department visits declined by 23% for heart attacks  20% for strokes  and 10% for diabetic emergencies  5 . The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency  CISA  COVID Task Force* examined the relationship between hospital strain and excess deaths during July 4  2020-July 10  2021  to assess the impact of COVID-19 surges on hospital system operations and potential effects on other critical infrastructure sectors and national critical functions. The study period included the months during which the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant became predominant in the United States. The negative binomial regression model used to calculate estimated deaths predicted that  if intensive care unit  ICU  bed use nationwide reached 75% capacity an estimated 12 000 additional excess deaths would occur nationally over the next 2 weeks. As hospitals exceed 100% ICU bed capacity  80 000 excess deaths would be expected in the following 2 weeks. This analysis indicates the importance of controlling case growth and subsequent hospitalizations before severe strain. State  local  tribal  and territorial leaders could evaluate ways to reduce strain on public health and health care infrastructures  including implementing interventions to reduce overall disease prevalence such as vaccination and other prevention strategies  as well as ways to expand or enhance capacity during times of high disease prevalence.

His wife had already been infected with COVID-19 four days previously and he had been isolated in his house as a close contact. Polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was positive. He had untreated diabetes mellitus. On day 7  his percutaneous saturated oxygen fell to <70% and he was transported to a hospital by ambulance. He underwent tracheal intubation  mechanical ventilation  and treatments with half steroid pulse  tocilizumab  remdesivir  and heparin. However  his ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen  P F ratio  decreased to 120 under mechanical ventilation and he was transported to our hospital. On arrival  he did not synchronize with mechanical ventilation well. Initially  he was treated using a muscle relaxant and deep sedation to facilitate complete synchronization with mechanical ventilation and his P F ratio improved to 247; thus  he was treated with mechanical ventilation alone with intermittent placement in the prone position. In addition  he was treated with steroid pulse therapy after steroid tapering therapy for nearly one month  glycyrrhizin  γ-globulin  azithromycin  and heparin. On day 20  the tracheal tube was removed after the improvement of the P F ratio. We herein present the case of a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who survived following treatment by intensive immune suppression therapy  including the combination of steroid pulse and tocilizumab  followed by a tapering dose of steroid therapy  after an outbreak of COVID-19 Delta variant. Further studies are needed to investigate the usefulness of this regimen.

Herein we developed a multivalent Semliki Forest virus replicon-based mRNA vaccine targeting the receptor binding domain  RBD   heptad repeat domain  HR   membrane protein  M  and epitopes of nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2. The bacteria-mediated gene delivery offers the rapid production of large quantities of vaccine at a highly economical scale and notably allows the needle-free mass vaccination. A favourable Th1 dominated potent antibody and cellular immune responses were detected in the immunized mice. Further  immunization induced strong cross-protective neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  against the B.1.617.2 delta variant  Clade G . We recorded a difference in induction of IgA response by the immunization route with the oral route eliciting a strong mucosal sIgA response  which possibly has contributed to the enhanced protection conferred by the oral immunization. Hamsters immunized orally were completely protected against the viral replication in the lungs and the nasal cavity. Importantly  the vaccine protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia. The study provides proof-of-principle findings for the development of a feasible and efficacious oral mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Variants have amino acid mutations at the spike region  a viral protein central in the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and vaccine response. Variants may dominate local epidemics  as Gamma  P.1  in Brazil  emerging in 2020 and prevailing until mid-2021. Different obstacles hinder a wider use of Next-Generation Sequencing for genomic surveillance. We describe Sanger based sequencing protocols: i  Semi-nested RT-PCR covering up to 3.684 kb  >96 %  spike gene; ii  One-Step RT-PCR for key Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  mutations  codons 417–501 ; iii  One-Step RT-PCR of partial N region to improve genomic capability. Protocols use leftovers of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs for quantitative RT-PCR diagnosis; with retro-transcribed DNA sequenced at ABI 3500 using dye termination chemistry. Analyses of sequences from 95 individuals  late 2020 early 2021  identified extensive amino acid variation  57 % with at least one key mutation at the Receptor Binding Domain  with B.1.1.28 lineage most prevalent  followed by Gamma and Zeta variants  with no Delta variant observed.

Genetic screens are often performed in transformed cell lines that poorly represent viral target cells in vivo  leading to discoveries that may not be translated to the clinic. Intestinal organoids are increasingly used to model human disease and are amenable to genetic engineering. To discern which host factors are reliable anti-coronavirus therapeutic targets  we generate mutant clonal IOs for 19 host genes previously implicated in coronavirus biology. We verify ACE2 and DPP4 as entry receptors for SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 replication in IOs does not require the endosomal Cathepsin B L proteases  but specifically depends on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. Other TMPRSS family members were not essential. The newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.7  as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV similarly depended on TMPRSS2. These findings underscore the relevance of non-transformed human models for coronavirus research  identify TMPRSS2 as an attractive pan-coronavirus therapeutic target  and demonstrate that an organoid knockout biobank is a valuable tool to investigate the biology of current and future emerging coronaviruses.

After a period with almost no cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  a resurgent Covid-19 outbreak began in mid-June 2021. Possible reasons for the resurgence were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the delta  B.1.617.2  variant and waning immunity. The extent of waning immunity of the vaccine against the delta variant in Israel is unclear. METHODS: We used data on confirmed infection and severe disease collected from an Israeli national database for the period of July 11 to 31  2021  for all Israeli residents who had been fully vaccinated before June 2021. We used a Poisson regression model to compare rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 among persons vaccinated during different time periods  with stratification according to age group and with adjustment for possible confounding factors. RESULTS: Among persons 60 years of age or older  the rate of infection in the July 11–31 period was higher among persons who became fully vaccinated in January 2021  when they were first eligible  than among those fully vaccinated 2 months later  in March  rate ratio  1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.3 to 2.0 . Among persons 40 to 59 years of age  the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in February  when they were first eligible   as compared with 2 months later  in April  was 1.7  95% CI  1.4 to 2.1 . Among persons 16 to 39 years of age  the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in March  when they were first eligible   as compared with 2 months later  in May  was 1.6  95% CI  1.3 to 2.0 . The rate ratio for severe disease among persons fully vaccinated in the month when they were first eligible  as compared with those fully vaccinated in March  was 1.8  95% CI  1.1 to 2.9  among persons 60 years of age or older and 2.2  95% CI  0.6 to 7.7  among those 40 to 59 years of age; owing to small numbers  the rate ratio could not be calculated among persons 16 to 39 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that immunity against the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 waned in all age groups a few months after receipt of the second dose of vaccine.

A systematic literature search with no language restriction was performed in electronic databases to identify eligible observational studies that reported the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to prevent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  confirmed COVID-19 caused by Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.617.2 . Random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled odds ratio  OR  at a 95% confidence interval  and the vaccine effectiveness was indicated as  pooled OR – 1  OR. Seven studies were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the administration of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine protected against RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 caused by Delta variant ≥ 21 days after the first dose  with vaccine effectiveness of 55%  95% confidence interval 46–63%   as well as ≥ 14 days after the second dose  with vaccine effectiveness of 81%  95% confidence interval 69–88% . In conclusion  the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine offers a substantial protection rate against RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant upon full vaccination  albeit with slightly reduced effectiveness relative to other strains of SARS-CoV-2.

We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections. METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared clinical features  virological and serological kinetics  anti-nucleocapsid  anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres  between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Out of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection  84 received a mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated  130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine-breakthrough group  only 2.8%  2 71  developed severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation compared to 53.1%  69 130  in the unvaccinated group  p<0.001 . Odds of severe COVID-19 following vaccination were significantly lower  adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95%CI: 0.015-0.335  p=0.001 . PCR cycle threshold values were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis  but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early  robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients  however  these titers were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with wildtype vaccine strain. CONCLUSION: The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response. Vaccination remains a key strategy for control of COVID-19 pandemic.

Reported COVID-19 cases  hospitalizations  and deaths occurring among persons aged ≥18 years during April 4-July 17  2021  were analyzed by vaccination status across 13 U.S. jurisdictions that routinely linked case surveillance and immunization registry data. Averaged weekly  age-standardized incidence rate ratios  IRRs  for cases among persons who were not fully vaccinated compared with those among fully vaccinated persons decreased from 11.1  95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.8-15.8  to 4.6  95% CI = 2.5-8.5  between two periods when prevalence of the Delta variant was lower  <50% of sequenced isolates; April 4-June 19  and higher  ≥50%; June 20-July 17   and IRRs for hospitalizations and deaths decreased between the same two periods  from 13.3  95% CI = 11.3-15.6  to 10.4  95% CI = 8.1-13.3  and from 16.6  95% CI = 13.5-20.4  to 11.3  95% CI = 9.1-13.9 . Findings were consistent with a potential decline in vaccine protection against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and continued strong protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death. Getting vaccinated protects against severe illness from COVID-19  including the Delta variant  and monitoring COVID-19 incidence by vaccination status might provide early signals of changes in vaccine-related protection that can be confirmed through well-controlled vaccine effectiveness  VE  studies.

It was found that the B.1.1.7  also 501Y.V1  variant  first detected in the United Kingdom  could be serendipitously detected by the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses  spike Δ69–70  would cause a “spike gene target failure”  SGTF  result. However  a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7  and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern  VOC  that lack spike Δ69–70  such as B.1.351  also 501Y.V2   detected in South Africa  and P.1  also 501Y.V3   recently detected in Brazil. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene  ORF1a Δ3675–3677  in all 3 variants  which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a Δ3675–3677 as the primary target and spike Δ69–70 to differentiate  we designed and validated an open-source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence and spread of B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1.

Beginning in July  the number of confirmed cases began to increase rapidly  first peaking during July-August  and then declining in September and October  Figure . After 3 months of relatively low case counts  COVID-19 cases began rapidly rising throughout the country in mid-December. On December 18  2020  South Africa published the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 variant strain with several mutations that affect the spike protein  2 . The variant included a mutation  N501Y  associated with increased transmissibility.† § SARS-CoV-2 lineages with this mutation have rapidly expanded geographically.¶ ** The variant strain  PANGO [Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak] lineage B.1.351††  was first detected in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa from specimens collected in early August  spread within South Africa  and appears to have displaced the majority of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in that country  2 . As of January 10  2021  eight countries had reported cases with the B.1.351 variant. In Zambia  the average number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases increased 16-fold  from 44 cases during December 1-10 to 700 during January 1-10  after detection of the B.1.351 variant in specimens collected during December 16-23. Zambia is a southern African country that shares substantial commerce and tourism linkages with South Africa  which might have contributed to the transmission of the B.1.351 variant between the two countries.

We estimated that B.1.526 had a moderate increase  15 to 25%  in transmissibility  could escape immunity in 0 to 10% of previously infected individuals  and substantially increased the infection fatality risk  IFR  among adults 65 or older by >60% during November 2020 to April 2021  compared to estimates for preexisting variants. Overall  findings suggest that new variants like B.1.526 likely spread in the population weeks before detection and that partial immune escape  e.g.  resistance to therapeutic antibodies  could offset prior medical advances and increase IFR. Early preparedness for and close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants  their epidemiological characteristics  and disease severity are thus crucial to COVID-19  coronavirus disease 2019  response.

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 infected nine vaccinated healthcare workers  HCW   thirty mild moderate  seventeen severe  and twenty-seven deceased patients  was performed. The significant predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern  VOC   Delta  lineage B.1.617.2  identified in sixty-four  77.1%  cases in contrast to B.1 and its sublineage in eleven  13.2%   variant under monitoring  VUM   Kappa  lineage B.1.617.1  in five  6.0%  and another VOC Alpha  lineage B.1.1.7  in three  3.6%  cases respectively  p < 0.05  χ 2  = 162.49 . 88.8% vaccine breakthrough  60% mild moderate  94.4% severe and 81.5% dead patients were infected by Delta. Kappa presents exclusively in mild moderate  Alpha in vaccine breakthrough  mild moderate  and dead patient and B.1 and its sublineages in mild  severe  and dead patient categories. Delta variant spike mutation of T19R  G142D  E156G  L452R  and deletion  F157 and R158  helps in escaping antibody response  T478K and D614G enhance viral affinity with ACE2 receptor while P681R and D950N result in higher replication and transmissibility by cleaving S1 S2 at furin site. We conclude that Delta variant predominant role along with co-occurrence of Kappa  Alpha  and B.1 variant during COVID-19 2nd wave pandemic in Chhattisgarh may pose a potential threat of future outbreak through hybrid variant evolution. Thus  intensive genomic surveillance for monitoring variant evolution and a more efficacious vaccine against the Delta and Alpha variants are required.

However  ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here  we completely map all of the mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain  RBD  that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody  LY-CoV555  and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages  E484K escapes LY-CoV555  K417N T escapes LY-CoV016 . In addition  the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore  we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to the antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

ARB was tested in patients as a drug candidate for the treatment at the early onset of COVID-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 . Despite promising clinical results and multiple ongoing trials  preclinical data are lacking and the molecular mechanism of action of ARB against SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here  we demonstrate that ARB binds to the spike viral fusion glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain as well as its more virulent variants from the United Kingdom  strain B.1.1.7  and South Africa  strain B.1.351 . We pinpoint the ARB binding site on the S protein to the S2 membrane fusion domain and use an infection assay with Moloney murine leukemia virus  MLV  pseudoviruses  PVs  pseudotyped with the S proteins of the Wuhan strain and the new variants to show that this interaction is sufficient for the viral cell entry inhibition by ARB. Finally  our experiments reveal that the ARB interaction leads to a significant destabilization and eventual lysosomal degradation of the S protein in cells. Collectively  our results identify ARB as the first clinically approved small molecule drug binder of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and place ARB among the more promising drug candidates for COVID-19.

However  a rapid recrudescence of COVID-19 was observed in the state of Victoria in June  2020. We aim to describe the genomic findings that located the source of this second wave and show the role of genomic epidemiology in the successful elimination of COVID-19 for a second time in Australia. METHODS: In this observational  genomic epidemiological study  we did genomic sequencing of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Victoria  Australia between Jan 25  2020  and Jan 31  2021. We did phylogenetic analyses  genomic cluster discovery  and integrated results with epidemiological data  detailed information on demographics  risk factors  and exposure  collected via interview by the Victorian Government Department of Health. Genomic transmission networks were used to group multiple genomic clusters when epidemiological and genomic data suggested they arose from a single importation event and diversified within Victoria. To identify transmission of emergent lineages between Victoria and other states or territories in Australia  all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences uploaded before Feb 11  2021  were obtained from the national sequence sharing programme AusTrakka  and epidemiological data were obtained from the submitting laboratories. We did phylodynamic analyses to estimate the growth rate  doubling time  and number of days from the first local infection to the collection of the first sequenced genome for the dominant local cluster  and compared our growth estimates to previously published estimates from a similar growth phase of lineage B.1.1.7  also known as the Alpha variant  in the UK. FINDINGS: Between Jan 25  2020  and Jan 31  2021  there were 20 451 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Victoria  Australia  of which 15 431 were submitted for sequencing  and 11 711 met all quality control metrics and were included in our analysis. We identified 595 genomic clusters  with a median of five cases per cluster  IQR 2–11 . Overall  samples from 11 503  98·2%  of 11 711 cases clustered with another sample in Victoria  either within a genomic cluster or transmission network. Genomic analysis revealed that 10 426 cases  including 10 416  98·4%  of 10 584 locally acquired cases  diagnosed during the second wave  between June and October  2020  were derived from a single incursion from hotel quarantine  with the outbreak lineage  transmission network G  lineage D.2  rapidly detected in other Australian states and territories. Phylodynamic analyses indicated that the epidemic growth rate of the outbreak lineage in Victoria during the initial growth phase  samples collected between June 4 and July 9  2020; 47·4 putative transmission events  per branch  per year [1 years; 95% credible interval 26·0–85·0]   was similar to that of other reported variants  such as B.1.1.7 in the UK  mean approximately 71·5 1 years . Strict interventions were implemented  and the outbreak lineage has not been detected in Australia since Oct 29  2020. Subsequent cases represented independent international or interstate introductions  with limited local spread. INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights how rapid escalation of clonal outbreaks can occur from a single incursion. However  strict quarantine measures and decisive public health responses to emergent cases are effective  even with high epidemic growth rates. Real-time genomic surveillance can alter the way in which public health agencies view and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks.

The nomenclature to design the variants uses a colloquial form referred to the country or place of detection  a code from the “Pangolin” database and one from the “Nextstrain” page. New variants that have spread include the British B.1.1.7  20I 501Y.V1   the South African B.1.351  20H 501.V2   the Brazilian P.1  20J 501Y.V3   the Californians B.1.427 B.1.429  20C S:452R  and the most recent  the Indian B.1.617  VUI-21APR-01 . The gold standard for the identification of the variants is whole genome sequencing. However  real-time PCR techniques have already been developed for the detection of specific mutations that can facilitate their presumptive identification. The impact of these variants on global vaccination programs has raised concern. It is generally thought that  since the response evoked by the vaccine against the S antigen is directed at the entire protein and the mutations only affect specific regions  the escape effect of the vaccine antibodies will be limited. Among the future strategies proposed for immuno-protection  the increase in the number of doses  the alternation of vaccines and the development of specific vaccines against different variants has been suggested.

Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations at a slower rate compared with other RNA viruses  evolutionary pressures derived from the widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population have progressively favored the global emergence  though natural selection  of several variants of concern that carry multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike glycoprotein. These are often placed in key sites within major antibody epitopes and may therefore confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies  leading to partial immune escape  or otherwise compensate infectivity deficits associated with other non-synonymous substitutions. As previously shown by other authors  several emerging variants carry recurrent deletion regions  RDRs  that display a partial overlap with antibody epitopes located in the spike N-terminal domain  NTD . Comparatively  very little attention had been directed towards spike insertion mutations prior to the emergence of the B.1.1.529  omicron  lineage. This manuscript describes a single recurrent insertion region  RIR1  in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  characterized by at least 49 independent acquisitions of 1–8 additional codons between Val213 and Leu216 in different viral lineages. Even though RIR1 is unlikely to confer antibody escape  its association with two distinct formerly widespread lineages  A.2.5 and B.1.214.2   with the quickly spreading omicron and with other VOCs and VOIs warrants further investigation concerning its effects on spike structure and viral infectivity.

It increased in frequency very fast and by the end of May more than 70 000 cases had been confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR . To study the lineages and the diversity of the viral population during this first epidemic wave in Madrid we sequenced 224 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes collected from three hospitals from February to May 2020. All the known major lineages were found in this set of samples  though B.1 and B.1.5 were the most frequent ones  accounting for more than 60% of the sequences. In parallel with the B lineages and sublineages  the D614G mutation in the Spike protein sequence was detected soon after the detection of the first coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19  case in Madrid and in two weeks became dominant  being found in 80% of the samples and remaining at this level during all the study periods. The lineage composition of the viral population found in Madrid was more similar to the European population than to the publicly available Spanish data  underlining the role of Madrid as a national and international transport hub. In agreement with this  phylodynamic analysis suggested multiple independent entries before the national lockdown and air transportation restrictions.

A large number of mutations in the Spike protein suggest that its susceptibility to immune protection elicited by the existing COVID-19 infection and vaccines may be altered. In this study  we constructed the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron. The sensitivity of 28 serum samples from COVID-19 convalescent patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 original strain was tested against pseudotyped Omicron as well as the other variants of concern  VOCs  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta  and variants of interest  VOIs  Lambda  Mu . Our results indicated that the mean neutralization ED50 of these sera against Omicron decreased to 66  which is about 8.4-folds compared to the D614G reference strain  ED50 = 556   whereas the neutralization activity of other VOC and VOI pseudotyped viruses decreased only about 1.2–4.5-folds. The finding from our in vitro assay suggest that Omicron variant may lead to more significant escape from immune protection elicited by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and perhaps even by existing COVID-19 vaccines.

To characterize postvaccination infections  the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  LACDPH  used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2  CAIR2  data to describe age-adjusted infection and hospitalization rates during May 1-July 25  2021  by vaccination status. Whole genome sequencing  WGS -based SARS-CoV-2 lineages and cycle threshold  Ct  values from qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  for two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets  including the nucleocapsid  N  protein gene region and the open reading frame 1 ab  ORF1ab  polyprotein gene region * were reported for a convenience sample of specimens. Among 43 127 reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in Los Angeles County residents aged ≥16 years  10 895  25.3%  were in fully vaccinated persons  1 431  3.3%  were in partially vaccinated persons  and 30 801  71.4%  were in unvaccinated persons. Much lower percentages of fully vaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized  3.2%   were admitted to an intensive care unit  0.5%   and required mechanical ventilation  0.2%  compared with partially vaccinated persons  6.2%  1.0%  and 0.3%  respectively  and unvaccinated persons  7.6%  1.5%  and 0.5%  respectively   p<0.001 for all comparisons . On July 25  the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among unvaccinated persons was 4.9 times and the hospitalization rate was 29.2 times the rates among fully vaccinated persons. During May 1-July 25  the percentages of B.1.617.2  Delta  variant infections estimated from 6 752 samples with lineage data increased among fully vaccinated persons  from 8.6% to 91.2%   partially vaccinated persons  from 0% to 88.1%   and unvaccinated persons  from 8.2% to 87.1% . In May  there were differences in median Ct values by vaccination status; however  by July  no differences were detected among specimens from fully vaccinated  partially vaccinated  and unvaccinated persons by gene targets. These infection and hospitalization rate data indicate that authorized vaccines were protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 during a period when transmission of the Delta variant was increasing. Efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination  in coordination with other prevention strategies  are critical to preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.

Using S gene target failure  SGTF  as indication for Omicron BA.1  we identified 908 SGTF and 1 621 non-SGTF serial intervals in the same period. Within households  the mean serial interval for SGTF cases was 0.2–0.6 days shorter than for non-SGTF cases. This suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron is partly due to a shorter serial interval.

Ideally  these virus stocks should be genetically and functionally similar to the original clinical isolate  retaining wild-type properties to be reliably used in animal model studies. It is well-established that SARS-CoV-2 isolates serially passaged on Vero cell lines accumulate mutations and deletions in the furin cleavage site; however  these can be eliminated when passaged on Calu-3 lung epithelial cell lines  as presented in this study. As numerous stocks of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are being grown in cell cultures with the intent for use in animal models  it is essential that propagation methods generate virus stocks that are pathogenic in vivo. Here  we found that the propagation of a B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 stock on Calu-3 cells eliminated viruses that previously accumulated mutations in the furin cleavage site. Notably  there were alternative variants that accumulated at the same nucleotide positions in virus populations grown on Calu-3 cells at multiple independent facilities. When a Calu-3-derived B.1.351 virus stock was used to infect hamsters  the virus remained pathogenic and the Calu-3-specific variants persisted in the population. These results suggest that Calu-3-derived virus stocks are pathogenic but care should still be taken to evaluate virus stocks for newly arising mutations during propagation.

RBD9.1 can be recognized by coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  convalescent serum  particularly for those with high neutralizing potency. Immunization with RBD9.1 can successfully induce the production of the receptor-binding domain  RBD -specific antibodies in Balb c mice. Importantly  the immunized sera exhibit sustained neutralizing efficacy against multiple dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant strains  including B.1.617.2 that carries a point mutation  S L452R   within the sequence of RBD9.1. Specifically  S Y451  and S Y454  are identified as the key amino acids for the binding of the induced RBD-specific antibodies to RBD9.1. Furthermore  we have confirmed that the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide can induce a S 448-456   NYNYLYRLF -specific CD8 +  T-cell response. Both RBD9.1-specific B cells and the S 448-456 -specific T cells can still be activated more than 3 months post the last immunization. This study provides a potential vaccine candidate that can generate long-term protective efficacy over SARS-CoV-2 variants  with the unique functional mechanism of activating both humoral and cellular immunity.

In this study  200 recipients immunized with three doses of a COVID-19-inactivated vaccine were enrolled  whose serum samples were collected within 2 months after the third immunization. The neutralizing activity of sera against the pseudotyped Omicron variant  prototype  and Delta variant was determined. Our results demonstrated that the positive neutralization activity was 95.5% for the Omicron variant  99.5% for the prototype  and 98.5% for the Delta variant. The geometric mean titers  GMT  for the Omicron variant was 49 and maintained sustained immune levels for 2 months  which decreased by 4.9-fold and 3.0-fold compared with the prototype  GMT  239  and Delta variant  GMT  148   respectively. In summary  our study demonstrated that three doses of a COVID-19-inactivated vaccine effectively yielded potent cross-neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant at 2 months after the third vaccination.

METHODS: We conducted a phylodynamic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained from tertiary medical centers in the Greater Tokyo Area and Sapporo  the largest city in the island of Hokkaido  and genome sequences published by GISAID  an international SARS-CoV-2 genome database. We also analyzed the statistics on the person-nights of travelers in the island of Hokkaido from the Greater Tokyo Area in 2019 versus 2020. RESULTS: At least eight sub-lineages belonging to the B.1.1.214 lineage were introduced to the island of Hokkaido from the island of Honshu  the mainland of Japan from late July to November 2020  during the governmental travel promotion program. Five of the eight sub-lineages originated from the Greater Tokyo Area. Comparison of the monthly ratios of the person-nights of travelers in the island of Hokkaido from the Greater Tokyo Area in 2019 and 2020 revealed that the highest value occurred in October 2020. CONCLUSION: We contend that the Japanese governmental travel promotion program contributed to the introduction of the B.1.1.214 sub-lineages from the main island of Honshu to the island of Hokkaido  and drove the third wave in Hokkaido  even if we are unable to establish the causality.

We aimed to investigate whether increases in the proportion of infections with this variant are associated with differences in symptoms or disease course  reinfection rates  or transmissibility. METHODS: We did an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and reported symptoms  disease course  rates of reinfection  and transmissibility. Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27  2020  during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK . From this dataset  we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection  defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the B.1.1.7 variant across the UK was estimated with use of genomic data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and data from Public Health England on spike-gene target failure  a non-specific indicator of the B.1.1.7 variant  in community cases in England. We used linear regression to examine the association between reported symptoms and proportion of B.1.1.7. We assessed the Spearman correlation between the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases and number of reinfections over time  and between the number of positive tests and reinfections. We estimated incidence for B.1.1.7 and previous variants  and compared the effective reproduction number  R t   for the two incidence estimates. FINDINGS: From Sept 28 to Dec 27  2020  positive COVID-19 tests were reported by 36 920 COVID Symptom Study app users whose region was known and who reported as healthy on app sign-up. We found no changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. For the same period  possible reinfections were identified in 249  0·7% [95% CI 0·6–0·8]  of 36 509 app users who reported a positive swab test before Oct 1  2020  but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants. Reinfection occurrences were more positively correlated with the overall regional rise in cases  Spearman correlation 0·56–0·69 for South East  London  and East of England  than with the regional increase in the proportion of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant  Spearman correlation 0·38–0·56 in the same regions   suggesting B.1.1.7 does not substantially alter the risk of reinfection. We found a multiplicative increase in the R t  of B.1.1.7 by a factor of 1·35  95% CI 1·02–1·69  relative to pre-existing variants. However  R t  fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns  even in regions with high proportions of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant. INTERPRETATION: The lack of change in symptoms identified in this study indicates that existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the B.1.1.7 variant. In addition  given that there was no apparent increase in the reinfection rate  vaccines are likely to remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.

Due to the widespread delta variant  more than 600 healthcare workers had COVID-19 despite completion of two-dose CoronaVac. The Ministry of Public Health recommended that healthcare workers received a third dose of AZD1222 to increase level of protection against SARS-CoV-2. However  immune response after the AZD1222 booster in individuals who completed the two-dose CoronaVac vaccine are limited. In this study  sera from those who received a booster of AZD1222 in June-July 2021 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain  RBD  IgG  anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and anti-spike protein 1  S1  IgA. The neutralizing activities in a subset of serum samples were tested against the wild type and variants of concern  B.1.1.7  B.1.617.2  and B.1.351  using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based surrogate virus neutralization test. Participants who received the booster of AZD1222 possessed higher levels of spike RBD-specific IgG  total immunoglobulins  and anti-S1 IgA than the two-dose vaccinees  p < 0.001 . They also elicited higher neutralizing activity against the wild type and all variants of concern than the recipients of the two-dose vaccines. This study demonstrated a high immunogenicity of the AZD1222 booster in individuals who completed the two-dose inactivated vaccines.

We report diverse virological characteristics of UK intensive care patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial that potentially influence treatment outcomes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs collected pre-treatment was quantified by PCR. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains using allele-specific probes or restriction site polymorphism  SfcI  targeting D1118H. RESULTS: Of 1274 subjects  90% were PCR-positive with viral loads 118-1.7x10  11  IU ml. Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those seronegative for IgG antibodies  n=354; 28%  compared to seropositives  n=939; 72% . Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from <1% in early November  2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives  medians 5.8x10  6  and 2.0 x10  5  IU ml respectively; p=2x10  -15  . However  viral load distributions were elevated in both seronegative and seropositive subjects infected with B.1.1.7  4.0x10  6  and 1.6x10  6  IU ml respectively . CONCLUSIONS: High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects and resistance to seroconversion indicate less effective clearance by innate and adaptive immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 strain  viral loads and antibody status define subgroups for analysis of treatment efficacy.

The question is what percentage of the population needs to be immune to reach herd immunity  that is to avoid future outbreaks. The answer depends on the basic reproductive number  R 0   a key epidemiological parameter measuring the transmission capacity of a disease. In addition to the virus itself  R 0  also depends on the characteristics of the population and their environment. Additionally  the estimate of R 0  depends on the methodology used  the accuracy of data and the generation time distribution. This study aims to reflect on the difficulties surrounding R 0  estimation  and provides Spain with a threshold for herd immunity  for which we considered the different combinations of all the factors that affect the R 0  of the Spanish population. Estimates of R 0  range from 1.39 to 3.10 for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant  with the largest differences produced by the method chosen to estimate R 0 . With these values  the herd immunity threshold  HIT  ranges from 28.1 to 67.7%  which would have made 70% a realistic upper bound for Spain. However  the imposition of the delta variant  B.1.617.2 lineage  in late summer 2021 may have expanded the range of R 0  to 4.02–8.96 and pushed the upper bound of the HIT to 90%.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here  we investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial cells  coronary artery endothelial cells  HCAEC   cardiac and lung microvascular endothelial cells  or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently  only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   required for virus infection. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.2 resulted in significantly higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this  no intracellular double-stranded viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1  which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects  the variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial cells  HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication. Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7  suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients infected with this variant.

The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike  S  protein receptor-binding domain  RBD . However  a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here  we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron’s infectivity  vaccine breakthrough  and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence  AI  model  which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2  reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional  3D  structures of antibody–RBD complexes  we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  FDA -approved monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca  Regeneron mAb cocktail  Celltrion  and Rockefeller University. However  its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline’s sotrovimab appear to be mild. Our work calls for new strategies to develop the next generation mutation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibodies.

The delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared with the alpha variant  which was the dominant variant in the UK between December  2020  and May  2021. To understand transmission and the effectiveness of interventions  we aimed to investigate whether the delta variant generation time  the interval between infections in infector–infectee pairs  is shorter—ie  transmissions are happening more quickly—than that of the alpha variant. METHODS: In this epidemiological analysis  we analysed transmission data from an ongoing UK Health Security Agency  UKHSA  prospective household study. Households were recruited to the study after an index case had a positive PCR test and genomic sequencing was used to determine the variant responsible. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data  we estimated the intrinsic generation time  which assumes a constant supply of susceptible individuals throughout infection  and the household generation time  which reflects realised transmission in the study households  accounting for susceptible depletion  for the alpha and delta variants. FINDINGS: Between February and August  2021  227 households consisting of 559 participants were recruited to the UKHSA study. The alpha variant was detected or assumed to be responsible for infections in 131 households  243 infections in 334 participants  recruited in February–May  and the delta variant in 96 households  174 infections in 225 participants  in May–August. The mean intrinsic generation time was shorter for the delta variant  4·7 days  95% credible interval [CI] 4·1–5·6  than the alpha variant  5·5 days  4·7–6·5   with 92% posterior probability. The mean household generation time was 28%  95% CI 0–48%  shorter for the delta variant  3·2 days  95% CI 2·5–4·2  than the alpha variant  4·5 days  3·7–5·4   with 97·5% posterior probability. INTERPRETATION: The delta variant transmits more quickly in households than the alpha variant  which can be attributed to faster depletion of susceptible individuals in households and a possible decrease in the intrinsic generation time. Interventions such as contact tracing  testing  and isolation might be less effective if transmission of the virus occurs quickly.

It was reported that  among majority of the infections due to the delta variant  only 9.8% percent cases required hospitalization  whereas only 0.4% fatality was observed. Sudden dropdown in COVID-19 infections cases were observed within a short timeframe  suggesting better host adaptation with evolved delta variant. Downregulation of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 by ORF8 induced MHC-I degradation has been reported earlier. The Delta variant carried mutations  deletion  at Asp119 and Phe120 amino acids which are critical for ORF8 dimerization. The deletions of amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 in ORF8 of delta variant resulted in structural instability of ORF8 dimer caused by disruption of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges as revealed by structural analysis and MD simulation studies. Further  flexible docking of wild type and mutant ORF8 dimer revealed reduced interaction of mutant ORF8 dimer with MHC-I as compared to wild-type ORF8 dimer with MHC-1  thus implicating its possible role in MHC-I expression and host immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We thus propose that mutant ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant may not be hindering the MHC-I expression thereby resulting in a better immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  which partly explains the possible reason for sudden drop of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 predominated by delta variant in India.

Although several neutralizing antibodies were authorized for emergency clinical use  convalescent patients derived natural antibodies are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation. Here  we describe the screen of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  targeted nanobodies  Nbs  from a synthetic library and the design of a biparatopic Nb  named Nb1–Nb2  with tight affinity and super-wide neutralization breadth against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Deep-mutational scanning experiments identify the potential binding epitopes of the Nbs on the RBD and demonstrate that biparatopic Nb1–Nb2 has a strong escape-resistant feature against more than 60 tested RBD amino acid substitutions. Using pseudovirion-based and trans-complementation SARS-CoV-2 tools  we determine that the Nb1–Nb2 broadly neutralizes multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants at sub-nanomolar levels  including Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   Delta  B.1.617.2   Lambda  C.37   Kappa  B.1.617.1   and Mu  B.1.621 . Furthermore  a heavy-chain antibody is constructed by fusing the human IgG1 Fc to Nb1–Nb2  designated as Nb1–Nb2-Fc  to improve its neutralization potency  yield  stability  and potential half-life extension. For the new Omicron variant  B.1.1.529  that harbors unprecedented multiple RBD mutations  Nb1–Nb2-Fc keeps a firm affinity  KD < 1.0 × 10 −12  M  and strong neutralizing activity  IC 50  = 1.46 nM for authentic Omicron virus . Together  we developed a tetravalent biparatopic human heavy-chain antibody with ultrapotent and broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity which highlights the potential clinical applications.

A new Variant of Concern  VOC  named the Omicron variant  B.1.1.529  was reported recently. This variant has a large number of mutations in the S protein. To date  there exists a limited information on the Omicron variant. Here we present the analyses of mutation distribution  the evolutionary relationship of Omicron with previous variants  and probable structural impact of mutations on antibody binding. Our analyses show the presence of 46 high prevalence mutations specific to Omicron. Twenty-three of these are localized within the spike  S  protein and the rest localized to the other 3 structural proteins of the virus  the envelope  E   membrane  M   and nucleocapsid  N . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Omicron is closely related to the Gamma  P.1  variant. The structural analyses showed that several mutations are localized to the region of the S protein that is the major target of antibodies  suggesting that the mutations in the Omicron variant may affect the binding affinities of antibodies to the S protein.

This study aimed to assess neutralizing antibody activity against the wild-type  BetaCoV Korea KCDC03 2020   delta  and omicron variants after full primary and booster vaccinations with BNT162b2. A plaque reduction neutralization test was employed to determine 50% neutralizing dilution  ND 50   titers in serum samples. ND 50  titers against the omicron variant  median [interquartile range]  5.3 [< 5.0–12.7]  after full primary vaccination were lower than those against the wild-type  144.8 [44.7–294.0]  and delta  24.3 [14.3–81.1]  variants. Furthermore  19 30 participants  63.3%  displayed lower ND 50  titers than the detection threshold  < 10.0  against omicron after full primary vaccination. However  the booster vaccine significantly increased ND 50  titers against BetaCoV Korea KCDC03 2020  delta  and omicron  although titers against omicron remained lower than those against the other variants  P < 0.001 . Our study suggests that booster vaccination with BNT162b2 significantly increases humoral immunity against the omicron variant.

However  in some academic programs  such as health-related programs  aviation  and kindergarten through grade 12  K-12  education  maintaining physical distance while still providing instruction is difficult; for universities with such programs  a single confirmed case of COVID-19 could result in a large number of students  staff members  and instructors being designated close contacts and requiring quarantine if they are not fully vaccinated  even if masks were worn when contact occurred. In January 2021  the St. Louis City Health Department allowed Saint Louis University  SLU  to implement a modified quarantine protocol that considered mask use when determining which close contacts required quarantine.* To assess the impact of the protocol  SLU assessed positive SARS-CoV-2 test result rates by masking status of the persons with COVID-19 and their close contacts. During January-May 2021  265 students received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; these students named 378 close contacts. Compared with close contacts whose exposure only occurred when both persons were masked  7.7%   close contacts with any unmasked exposure  32.4%  had higher adjusted odds ratios  aORs  of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result  aOR = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-31.1 . Any additional exposures were associated with a 40.0% increase in odds of a positive test result  aOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-1.6 . These findings reinforce that universal masking and having fewer encounters in close contact with persons with COVID-19 prevents the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a university setting. Universities opening for in-person instruction could consider taking mask use into account when determining which unvaccinated close contacts require quarantine if enforced testing protocols are in place. However  this study was conducted before the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant became the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States  which could have affected these findings given that the Delta variant has been found to be associated with increased transmissibility compared to previous variants.

Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have  presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment  independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence  all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of COVID-19. Here  by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARSCoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes and gene segments  such as S  nsp2 and nsp6   that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving continuing sequence diversification  we find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members of these known 501Y lineages  and others still undiscovered  are convergently evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.

Through genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021  we identified the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern  lineage P.1  that acquired 17 mutations  including a trio in the spike protein  K417T  E484K and N501Y  associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around early November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data  we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4–2.2 times more transmissible and 25–61% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern  which may exhibit increased transmissibility and or immune evasion  is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.

Although many vaccines have been developed  a large proportion of the global population remains at high risk of infection. The current study aims to develop an antiviral peptide capable of inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its six major variants with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor. An in-silico approach was employed to design a therapeutic peptide inhibitor against the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the spike  S  protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.1  B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 . The binding specificity and affinity of our designed peptide inhibitor Mod13AApi  YADKYQKQYKDAY  with wild-type S-RBD and its six variants was confirmed by molecular docking using the HPEPDOCK tool  whereas complex stability was determined by the MD simulation study. The physicochemical and ADMET  absorption  distribution  metabolism  excretion  and toxicity  properties of inhibitory peptides were determined using the ExPASy tool and pkCSM server. The docking results and its properties from our in-silico analysis present the Mod13AApi  a promising peptide for the rapid development of anti-coronavirus peptide-based antiviral therapy. Blockage of the binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants with ACE2 in the presence of the therapeutic peptide may prevent deadly SARS-CoV-2 variants entry into host cells. Therefore  the designed inhibitory peptide can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19  as evident from this in-silico study.

The current surge in infection rates around the globe is driven by the variant of concern  VoC  omicron  B.1.1.529 . Here  we evaluated the performance of nine SARS-CoV-2 RATs in a single-centre laboratory study. We examined a total of 115 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative and 166 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive respiratory swab samples  101 omicron  65 delta  B.1.617.2   collected from October 2021 until January 2022 as well as cell culture-expanded clinical isolates of both VoCs. In an assessment of the analytical sensitivity in clinical specimen  the 50% limit of detection  LoD50  ranged from 1.77 × 10 6  to 7.03 × 10 7  RNA copies subjected to the RAT for omicron compared to 1.32 × 10 5  to 2.05 × 10 6  for delta. To score positive in these point-of-care tests  up to 10-fold  LoD50  or 101-fold  LoD95  higher virus loads were required for omicron- compared to delta-containing samples. The rates of true positive test results for omicron samples in the highest virus load category  Ct values < 25  ranged between 31.4 and 77.8%  while they dropped to 0–8.3% for samples with intermediate Ct values  25–30 . Of note  testing of expanded virus stocks suggested a comparable RAT sensitivity of both VoCs  questioning the predictive value of this type of in vitro-studies for clinical performance. Given their importance for national test strategies in the current omicron wave  awareness must be increased for the reduced detection rate of omicron infections by RATs and a short list of suitable RATs that fulfill the minimal requirements of performance should be rapidly disclosed.

Among the sequences were three novel viral variants: BV-1 with a B.1.1.7 20I genetic background and an additional spike mutation Q493R  associated with a mild but longer-than-usual COVID-19 case in a college-age person  BV-2 with a T478K mutation on a 20B genetic background  and BV-3  an apparent recombinant lineage. This work highlights the potential of an undervaccinated younger population as a reservoir for the spread and generation of novel variants. This also demonstrates the value of whole genome sequencing as a routine disease surveillance tool.

Its sudden outbreak in China has led the government to quickly carry out large-scale nucleic acid testing to curb its spread. This qualitative study aims to find the challenges based on empirical evidence from the perspectives of the different groups of people involved in the testing  and further explore possible strategies to improve the efficiency of large-scale nucleic acid testing. Using a phenomenological approach  we selected 35 participants  seven managers  eight health professionals  six community volunteers and 14 residents  by purposive sampling. The interviews were conducted by in-depth semi-structured interviews and the data were analyzed by Colaizzi’s seven-step method. Qualitative analysis revealed three main themes: unreasonable and unsafe testing points layout settings  human and medical resources challenges  and potential infection risk. From the different angles  participants all experienced challenges during large-scale nucleic acid testing  making positive planning and adequate preparation important parts of the smooth development of testing. Large-scale nucleic acid testing relies on the cooperation and efforts of all to support containment of the spread of the virus. Local governments should improve their ability to respond to and deal with public health emergencies.

The emergence of these “variants of concern” has increased immune escape and has supplanted the ancestral strains. The novel variants harbored by the B.1.617 lineage  kappa and delta  carry mutations within the receptor-binding domain of spike  S  protein  L452R + E484Q and L452R + T478K   the region binding to the host receptor. The double mutations carried by these novel variants are primarily responsible for an upsurge number of COVID-19 cases in India. In this study  we thoroughly investigated the impact of these double mutations on the binding capability to the human host receptor. We performed several structural analyses and found that the studied double mutations increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to the human host receptor  ACE2 . Furthermore  our study showed that these double mutants might be a dominant contributor enhancing the receptor-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently making it more stable. We also investigated the impact of these mutations on the binding affinity of two monoclonal antibodies  Abs   2-15 and LY-CoV555  and found that the presence of the double mutations also hinders its binding with the studied Abs. The principal component analysis  free energy landscape  intermolecular interaction  and other investigations provided a deeper structural insight to better understand the molecular mechanism responsible for increased viral transmissibility of these variants.

We evaluated the sensitivity of AY.4.2 to neutralisation by sera from 30 Comirnaty  BNT162b2 mRNA  vaccine recipients in Denmark in November 2021. AY.4.2 neutralisation was comparable to other circulating Delta lineages or sub-lineages. Conversely  the less prevalent B.1.617.2 with E484K showed a significant more than 4-fold reduction in neutralisation that warrants surveillance of strains with the acquired E484K mutation.

Ecuador was the second country in South America to report confirmed cases. The first case reported in Quito  the capital city of Ecuador  was a tourist who came from the Netherlands and presented symptoms on March 10th  2020  index case . In this work we used the MinION platform  Oxford Nanopore Technologies  to sequence the metagenome of the bronchoalveolar lavage  BAL  from this case reported  and subsequently we sequenced the whole genome of the index case and other three patients using the ARTIC network protocols. Our data from the metagenomic approach confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coexisting with pathogenic bacteria suggesting coinfection. Relevant bacteria found in the BAL metagenome were Streptococcus pneumoniae  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydia spp. Lineage assignment of the four whole genomes revealed three different origins. The variant HEE-01 was imported from the Netherlands and was assigned to B lineage  HGSQ-USFQ-018  belongs to the B.1 lineage showing nine nucleotide differences with the reference strain and grouped with sequences from the United Kingdom  and HGSQ-USFQ-007 and HGSQ-USFQ-010 belong to the B lineage and grouped with sequences from Scotland. All genomes show mutations in their genomes compared to the reference strain  which could be important to understand the virulence  severity and transmissibility of the virus. Our findings also suggest that there were at least three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Ecuador.

There is a critical need to understand the impact of the emerging variants on host response and disease dynamics to facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics. METHODS: Syrian golden hamsters are the leading small animal model that recapitulates key aspects of severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . We performed intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into hamsters with the ancestral virus  nCoV-WA1-2020  or VOC first identified in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7  alpha  and South Africa  B.1.351  beta  and analyzed viral loads and host responses. FINDINGS: Similar gross and histopathologic pulmonary lesions were observed after infection with all three variants. Although differences in viral genomic copy numbers were noted in the lungs and oral swabs of challenged animals  infectious titers in the lungs were comparable between the variants. Antibody neutralization capacities varied  dependent on the original challenge virus and cross-variant protective capacity. Transcriptional profiling of lung samples 4 days post-challenge  DPC  indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in response to B.1.1.7 infection. Furthermore  no additional mutations in the spike protein were detected at 4 DPC. INTERPRETATIONS: Although disease severity and viral shedding were not significantly different  the emerging VOC induced distinct humoral responses and transcriptional profiles compared to the ancestral virus. These observations suggest potential differences in acute early responses or alterations in immune modulation by VOC.

We examined whether sera from recovered and naive donors collected prior to  and following immunizations with existing mRNA vaccines  could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351  but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of naïve donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses  but at lower titers. Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies.

The spike  S  protein of SARS-CoV-2  which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process  is composed of two subunits  S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent entry into cells. Mutations in the spike protein  S  are of particular interest due to their potential for reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies or increasing the viral transmissibility and infectivity. Recently  many mutations in the spike protein released new variants  including the Delta and Kappa ones  known as the Indian variants . The variants Delta and Kappa are now of most recent concern because of their well-increased infectivity  both a spin-off of the B.1.617 lineage  which was first identified in India in October 2020. This study employed homology modeling to probe the potential structural effects of the mutations. It was found that the mutations  Leu452Arg  Thr478Lys  and Glu484Gln in the spike protein increase the affinity for the hACE2 receptor  which explains the greater infectivity of the SARS-Cov-2 B.1.617  Indian Variant .

No significant difference was observed between the 20B and 19A isolates for HCWs with mild COVID-19 and critical patients. However  a significant decrease in neutralization ability was found for 20I 501Y.V1 in comparison with 19A isolate for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. Concerning 20H 501Y.V2  all populations had a significant reduction in neutralizing antibody titers in comparison with the 19A isolate. Interestingly  a significant difference in neutralization capacity was observed for vaccinated HCWs between the two variants but not in the convalescent groups.

The new strain 501.V2 in South Africa bears three mutations in the spike receptor-binding domain  RBD ; K417 N  E484K  and N501Y  while the Brazilian B.1.1.248 lineage has 12 mutations. In the current study  we simulate the complex ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD system in which the RBD is in the wild-type and mutated isoforms. Additionally  the cell-surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78  CS-GRP78  associated with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD complex  ACE2-S RBD  is modeled at the presence of these mutant variants of the viral spike. The results showed that E484K and N501Y are critical in viral spike recognition through either ACE2 or CS-GRP78. The mutated variants  the UK  South African  and Brazilian  of the spike RBD tightly bind to GRP78 more than in the case of the wild-type RBD. These results point to the potent role of GRP78 with ACE2 in the attachment of the new variants  which could be a key for the design of inhibitors to block SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the host cell.

CRISPR Cas  Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats CRISPR-associated  based detection systems have the potential to transform the landscape of COVID-19 diagnostics due to their programmability; however  most of these methods are reliant on either a multi-step process involving amplification or elaborate guide RNA designs. METHODS: Three Cas12b proteins from Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris  AacCas12b   Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus  AapCas12b   and Brevibacillus sp. SYP-B805  BrCas12b  were expressed and purified  and their thermostability was characterised by differential scanning fluorimetry  cis-  and trans-cleavage activities over a range of temperatures. The BrCas12b was then incorporated into a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP -based one-pot reaction system  coined CRISPR-SPADE  CRISPR Single Pot Assay for Detecting Emerging VOCs . FINDINGS: Here we describe a complete one-pot detection reaction using a thermostable Cas12b effector endonuclease from Brevibacillus sp. to overcome these challenges detecting and discriminating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in clinical samples. CRISPR-SPADE was then applied for discriminating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  including Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   Delta  B.1.617.2   and Omicron  B.1.1.529  and validated in 208 clinical samples. CRISPR-SPADE achieved 92·8% sensitivity  99·4% specificity  and 96·7% accuracy within 10–30 min for discriminating the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  in agreement with S gene sequencing  achieving a positive and negative predictive value of 99·1% and 95·1%  respectively. Interestingly  for samples with high viral load  Ct value ≤ 30   100% accuracy and sensitivity were attained. To facilitate dissemination and global implementation of the assay  a lyophilised version of one-pot CRISPR-SPADE reagents was developed and combined with an in-house portable multiplexing device capable of interpreting two orthogonal fluorescence signals. INTERPRETATION: This technology enables real-time monitoring of RT-LAMP-mediated amplification and CRISPR-based reactions at a fraction of the cost of a qPCR system. The thermostable Brevibacillus sp. Cas12b offers relaxed primer design for accurately detecting SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a simple and robust one-pot assay. The lyophilised reagents and simple instrumentation further enable rapid deployable point-of-care diagnostics that can be easily expanded beyond COVID-19.

To evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses in vaccinated individuals with or without a previous history of COVID-19  we compared levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the sera from 21 vaccinees  including COVID-19-recovered or -naïve individuals in different times  before and after immunization with an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies elicited after COVID-19 and or immunization with an inactivated vaccine were measured by ELISA and Plaque Reduction Neutralizing assays. Antibody kinetics were consistently different between the two vaccine doses for naïve individuals  contrasting with the SARS-CoV-2-recovered subjects in which we observed no additional increase in antibody levels following the second dose. Sera from SARS-CoV2-naïve individuals had no detectable neutralizing activity against lineage B.1 SARS-CoV-2 or Gamma variant five months after the second vaccine dose. Contrarily  SARS-CoV-2-recovered subjects retained considerable neutralizing activity against both viruses. We conclude that a single inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose may be sufficient to induce protective antibody responses in individuals with previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study  we evaluated one RT-PCR kit for this screening  ID SARS-CoV-2 UK SA Variant Triplex ®   ID Solutions  Grabels  France  on 2207 nasopharyngeal samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using ID Solutions kit  4.1%  92 2207  of samples were suspected to belonged to B.1.351 or P.1 variants. Next-generation sequencing that was performed on 67.4%  62 92  of these samples confirmed the presence of a B.1.351 variant in only 75.8% of the samples  47 62 . Thirteen samples belonged to the UK variant  B.1.1.7   and two to A.27 with N501Y mutation. The thirteen with the UK variant presented one mutation in the S-gene  near the ΔH69 ΔV70 deletion  S71F or A67S   which impacted the detection of ΔH69 ΔV70 deletion. Using another screening kit  PKampVariantDetect SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR combination 1 and 3 ®  PerkinElmer  Waltham  MA  USA  on the misidentified samples  we observed that the two mutations  S71F or A67S  did not impact the detection of the UK variant. In conclusion  this study highlights the limitations of the screening strategy based on the detection of few mutations deletions as well as it not being able to follow the virus evolution.

METHODS: For 38 European countries  data on numbers of COVID-19 deaths  SARS-COV-2 variants spread through time using Nextstrain classification  demographic and health characteristics were collected. Cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak during the second wave of the pandemic were considered as outcomes. Pearson correlations and multivariate generalized linear models with selection algorithms were used. RESULTS: The average proportion of B.1.1.7 variant was found to be a significant predictor of cumulative COVID-19 deaths within two months before the peak and between 1 January–25 February 2021  as well as of the deaths peak height considering proportions during the second wave and the pre-peak period. The average proportion of EU2 variant  S:477 N  was a significant predictor of cumulative COVID-19 deaths in the pre-peak period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spread of a new variant of concern B.1.1.7 had a significant impact on mortality during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and that proportions of EU2 and B.1.1.7 variants were associated with increased mortality in the initial phase of that wave.

Effective interventions are urgently needed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  have demonstrated their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2  and several have been granted authorization for emergency use. Here  we discover and characterize a fully human cross-reactive mAb  MW06  which binds to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain  RBD  and disrupts their interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptors. Potential neutralization activity of MW06 was observed against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in different assays. The complex structure determination and epitope alignment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD MW06 revealed that the epitope recognized by MW06 is highly conserved among SARS-related coronavirus strains  indicating the potential broad neutralization activity of MW06. In in vitro assays  no antibody-dependent enhancement  ADE  of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed for MW06. In addition  MW06 recognizes a different epitope from MW05  which shows high neutralization activity and has been in a Phase 2 clinical trial  supporting the development of the cocktail of MW05 and MW06 to prevent against future escaping variants. MW06 alone and the cocktail show good effects in preventing escape mutations  including a series of variants of concern  B.1.1.7  P.1  B.1.351  and B.1.617.1. These findings suggest that MW06 recognizes a conserved epitope on SARS-CoV-2  which provides insights for the development of a universal antibody-based therapy against SARS-related coronavirus and emerging variant strains  and may be an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent.

Although many kinds of RATs are available  their respective sensitivity has not been compared. Here  we examined the sensitivity of 27 RATs available in Japan for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. All of the RATs tested detected the delta variant albeit with different sensitivities.

Although actual clinical specimens were not examined  the detection level of most of the RATs was 7500 pfu  indicating that individuals whose test samples contained less virus than that would be considered negative. Therefore  it is important to bear in mind that RATs may miss individuals shedding low levels of infectious virus.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3  randomized  observer-blinded  placebo-controlled trial in the United States and Mexico during the first half of 2021 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in adults  ≥18 years of age  who had not had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary objective was to determine vaccine efficacy against reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction–confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease and against different variants was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 29 949 participants who underwent randomization between December 27  2020  and February 18  2021  a total of 29 582  median age  47 years; 12.6% ≥65 years of age  received at least one dose: 19 714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. Over a period of 3 months  77 cases of Covid-19 were noted — 14 among vaccine recipients and 63 among placebo recipients  vaccine efficacy  90.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]  82.9 to 94.6; P<0.001 . Ten moderate and 4 severe cases occurred  all in placebo recipients  yielding vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease of 100%  95% CI  87.0 to 100 . Most sequenced viral genomes  48 of 61  79%  were variants of concern or interest — largely B.1.1.7  alpha   31 of the 35 genomes for variants of concern  89% . Vaccine efficacy against any variant of concern or interest was 92.6%  95% CI  83.6 to 96.7 . Reactogenicity was mostly mild to moderate and transient but was more frequent among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients and was more frequent after the second dose than after the first dose. CONCLUSIONS: NVX-CoV2373 was safe and effective for the prevention of Covid-19. Most breakthrough cases were caused by contemporary variant strains.

Despite intensive measures taken around the world  morbidity and mortality remain high as many countries face new waves of infection and the spread of new variants. Worryingly  more and more variants are now being identified  such as 501Y.V1  B.1.1.7  in the UK  501Y.V2  B.1.351  in South Africa  501Y.V3 in Manaus  Brazil  and B.1.617 B.1.618 in India  which could lead to a severe epidemic rebound. Moreover  some variants have a stronger immune escape ability. To control the new SARS-CoV-2 variant  we may need to develop and redesign new vaccines repeatedly. So it is important to investigate how our immune system combats and responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection to develop safe and effective medical interventions. OBJECTIVES: In this study  we performed a longitudinal and proteome-wide analysis of antibodies in the COVID-19 patients to revealed some immune processes of COVID-19 patients against SARS-CoV-2 and found some dominant epitopes of a potential vaccine. METHODS: Microarray assay  Antibody depletion assays  Neutralization assay RESULTS: We profiled a B-cell linear epitope landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and identified the epitopes specifically recognized by either IgM  IgG  or IgA. We found that epitopes more frequently recognized by IgM are enriched in non-structural proteins. We further identified epitopes with different immune responses in severe and mild patients. Moreover  we identified 12 dominant epitopes eliciting antibodies in most COVID-19 patients and identified five key amino acids of epitopes. Furthermore  we found epitope S-82 and S-15 are perfect immunogenic peptides and should be considered in vaccine design. CONCLUSION: This data provide useful information and rich resources for improving our understanding of viral infection and developing a novel vaccine neutralizing antibodies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

We compared antibody binding and live virus neutralization of sera from naturally infected and Moderna vaccinated individuals against two SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1 containing the spike mutation D614G and the emerging B.1.351 variant containing additional spike mutations and deletions. Sera from acutely-infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a 3-fold reduction in binding antibody titers to the B.1.351 variant receptor binding domain of the spike protein and a 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant compared to the B.1 variant. Similar results were seen with sera from Moderna vaccinated individuals. Despite reduced antibody titers against the B.1.351 variant  sera from infected and vaccinated individuals containing polyclonal antibodies to the spike protein could still neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351  suggesting that protective humoral immunity may be retained against this variant.

Some of these variants  such as B.1.617.2  B.1.1.7  and B.1.351  manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants  with potential dramatic effects on the course of the pandemic. So far  analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast  insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the Spike  S  protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Here  we identify 346 unique inserts of different lengths in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing artifacts. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes  polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. At least three inserts in the N-terminal domain of the S protein are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies  whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity. Thus  inserts in the S protein can affect its antigenic properties and merit monitoring.

The BioNTech Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows 95% efficacy in preventing disease  but it is unclear how the antibody responses to vaccination differ from those generated by infection. Here we compare the magnitude and breadth of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2  SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  and endemic coronaviruses  in vaccinees and infected patients. We find that vaccination differs from infection in the dominance of IgG over IgM and IgA responses  with IgG reaching levels similar to those of severely ill COVID-19 patients and shows decreased breadth of the antibody response targeting endemic coronaviruses. Viral variants of concern from B.1.1.7 to P.1 to B.1.351 form a remarkably consistent hierarchy of progressively decreasing antibody recognition by both vaccinees and infected patients exposed to Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens.

Among 174 349 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals  ≥ 12 years   we observed an increased risk of S gene target failure  predictive of the Omicron variant  in vaccinated  odds ratio  OR : 3.6; 95% confidence interval  CI : 3.4–3.7  and previously infected individuals  OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 3.8–4.7  compared with infected naïve individuals. This suggests vaccine- or infection-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infections is less effective against the Omicron than the Delta variant.

However  whole genome sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species has been scant. Here  we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  AY.3  in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived viral genomes showed the two to be identical  and differing by between 4 and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and time period. However  several mutations unique to the feline samples reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten human and animal health  as well as highlight the importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals. To the authors’ knowledge  this is the first published case of a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.

Here  we isolate two VHH nanobodies  7A3 and 8A2  from dromedary camels by phage display  which have high affinity for the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and broad neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. Cryo-EM complex structures reveal that 8A2 binds the RBD in its up mode and 7A3 inhibits receptor binding by uniquely targeting a highly conserved and deeply buried site in the spike regardless of the RBD conformational state. 7A3 at a dose of ≥5 mg kg efficiently protects K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from the lethal challenge of B.1.351 or B.1.617.2  suggesting that the nanobody has promising therapeutic potentials to curb the COVID-19 surge with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 strains depends on binding affinity of the virus to its host cell receptor. In this paper  we quantified the binding affinity using Gibbs energy of binding and analyzed the competition between SARS-CoV-2 strains as an interference phenomenon. Gibbs energies of binding were calculated for several SARS-SoV-2 strains  including Hu-1  wild type   B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  Gamma   B.1.36 and B.1.617  Delta . The least negative Gibbs energy of binding is that of Hu-1 strain  -37.97 kJ mol. On the other hand  the most negative Gibbs energy of binding is that of the Delta strain  -49.50 kJ mol. We used the more negative Gibbs energy of binding to explain the increased infectivity of newer SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to the wild type. Gibbs energies of binding was found to decrease chronologically  with appearance of new strains. The ratio of Gibbs energies of binding of mutated strains and wild type was used to define a susceptibility coefficient  which is an indicator of viral interference  where a virus can prevent or partially inhibit infection with another virus.

These variants may also adapt to new hosts  in part through mutations in the spike protein. In this study  we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wild-type C57BL 6 mice. Six-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage  or the emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. We also infected a group of mice with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2  MA10 . Viral load and mRNA levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the lung tissues on day 3 after infection. Our data show that unlike the B.1 virus  the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses are capable of infecting C57BL 6 mice and replicating at high concentrations in the lungs. The B.1.351 virus replicated to higher titers in the lungs compared with the B.1.1.7 and MA10 viruses. The levels of cytokines  IL-6  TNF-α  IL-1β  and chemokine  CCL2  were upregulated in response to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection in the lungs. In addition  robust expression of viral nucleocapsid protein and histopathological changes were detected in the lungs of B.1.351-infected mice. Overall  these data indicate a greater potential for infectivity and adaptation to new hosts by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with enhanced transmissibility and altered antigenicity requires broad-spectrum therapies. Here we developed a panel of SARS-CoV-2 specific mouse monoclonal antibodies  mAbs   and characterized them based on ELISA  Western immunoblot  isotyping  and virus neutralization. Six neutralizing mAbs that exhibited high-affinity binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were identified  and their amino acid sequences were determined by mass spectrometry. Functional assays confirmed that three mAbs  F461G11  F461G15  and F461G16 neutralized four variants of concern  VOC : B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma  and B.1.617.2  delta  These mAbs are promising candidates for COVID-19 therapy  and understanding their interactions with virus spike protein should support further vaccine and antibody development.

The variants  including B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta  have shown reduced sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies  plasma and or sera obtained from convalescent patients and vaccinated individuals. Development of potent therapeutic monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  with broad neutralizing breadth have become a priority for alleviating the devastating effects of this pandemic. Here  we review some of the most promising broadly neutralizing antibodies obtained from plasma of patients that recovered from early variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may be effective against emerging new variants of the virus. This review summarizes several mAbs  that have been discovered to cross-neutralize across Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. Understanding the characteristics that confer this broad and cross-neutralization functions of these mAbs would inform on the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide the discovery of second-generation vaccines.

Here  we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity  revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralizing antibody approaches. Furthermore  we report a preclinical characterization package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert  with broad neutralization capacity  that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralized four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability  strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections. IMPORTANCE Mutational drift of SARS-CoV-2 risks rendering both therapeutics and vaccines less effective. Receptor decoy strategies utilizing soluble human ACE2 may overcome the risk of viral mutational escape since mutations disrupting viral interaction with the ACE2 decoy will by necessity decrease virulence  thereby preventing meaningful escape. The solution described here of a soluble ACE2 receptor decoy is significant for the following reasons: while previous ACE2-based therapeutics have been described  ours has novel features  including  i  mutations within ACE2 to remove catalytical activity and systemic interference with the renin angiotensin system   ii  abrogated FcγR engagement  reduced risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection  and reduced risk of hyperinflammation  and  iii  streamlined antibody-like purification process and scale-up manufacturability indicating that this receptor decoy could be produced quickly and easily at scale. Finally  we demonstrate that ACE2-based therapeutics confer a broad-spectrum neutralization potency for ACE2-tropic viruses  including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in contrast to therapeutic MAb.

In addition to corticosteroids  and antiviral drugs like remdesivir  various immunotherapies including monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated to treat COVID-19 patients. These mAbs were initially developed against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2; however  emergence of variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 having mutations in the spike protein in several countries including India raised serious questions on the potential use of these mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study  using an in silico approach  we have examined the binding abilities of eight mAbs against several SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Delta  B.1.617.2  lineages. The structure of the Fab region of each mAb was designed in silico and subjected to molecular docking against each mutant protein. mAbs were subjected to two levels of selection based on their binding energy  stability  and conformational flexibility. Our data reveal that tixagevimab  regdanvimab  and cilgavimab can efficiently neutralize most of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strains while tixagevimab  bamlanivimab  and sotrovimab can form a stable complex with the Delta variants. Based on these data  we have designed  by in silico  a chimeric antibody by conjugating the CDRH3 of regdanivimab with a sotrovimab framework to combat the variants that could potentially escape from the mAb-mediated neutralization. Our finding suggests that though currently available mAbs could be used to treat COVID-19 caused by the variants of SARS-CoV-2  better results could be expected with the chimeric antibodies.

Over 2500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected in the US since December 2020  but the extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel  genomic  and diagnostic data  we highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York  California  and Florida. Furthermore  we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020  followed by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally  we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in many states by mid to late March. Thus  genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.

The Delta variant  since its appearance  replaced the VOC Gamma  which was responsible for the major COVID-19 wave in Brazil. In this study  we performed a Delta whole-genome sequencing of 183 samples as part of a major genomic surveillance study performed since the beginning of the pandemic. Here  we showed an emergence  widespread dispersion and consolidation of the Delta variant in Rio Grande do Sul State  completely replacing the Gamma variant in a four to five months period. Performing the phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis  the majority of the sequences generated herein were classified as AY.99.2  AY.99.2-like and AY.101. AY.99.2 Delta-related lineage has been widely reported in Brazil and in the Americas as well. Altogether  our findings provided a mutational profile of the sequences and presented high substitutions per site in the root-to-tip phylogenetic tree  corroborating studies that show the high mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time.

Wastewater-based epidemiology  WBE  effectively forecasts the surge of COVID-19 cases in humans in a particular region. To understand the genomic characteristics footprints and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment  we analyzed 807 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 countries deposited in GISAID till 22 May 2021. The highest number of sequences  n = 638  were reported in Austria  followed by the Netherlands  China  and Bangladesh. Wastewater samples were highest  40.0%  to successfully yield the virus genome followed by a 24 h composite wastewater sample  32.6%  and sewage  18.5% . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 environmental strains are a close congener with the strains mostly circulating in the human population from the same region. Clade GRY  32.7%   G  29.2%   GR  25.3%   O  7.2%   GH  3.4%   GV  1.4%   S  0.5%   and L  0.4%  were found in environmental samples. Various lineages were identified in environmental samples; nevertheless  the highest percentages  49.4%  of the alpha variant  B.1.1.7  were detected in Austria  Liechtenstein  Slovenia  Czech Republic  Switzerland  Germany  and Italy. Other prevalent lineages were B.1  18.2%   B.1.1  9.2%   and B.1.160  3.9% . Furthermore  a significant number of amino acid substitutions were found in environmental strains where the D614G was found in 83.8% of the sequences. However  the key mutations—N501Y  44.6%   S982A  44.4%   A570D  43.3%   T716I  40.4%   and P681H  40.1%  were also recorded in spike protein. The identification of the environmental belvedere of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic signature is crucial to detect outbreaks  forecast pandemic harshness  and prepare with the appropriate tools to control any impending pandemic. We recommend genomic environmental surveillance to trace the emerging variants and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the community. Additionally  proper disposal and treatment of wastewater  sewage  and medical wastes are important to prevent environmental contamination.

New variants have been classified either as variants of concern  VOCs  or variants of interest  VOIs  by the CDC  USA  and WHO. The VOCs include lineages such as B.1.1.7  20I 501Y.V1 variant   P.1  20J 501Y.V3 variant   B.1.351  20H 501Y.V2 variant   and B.1.617.2. In contrast  the VOI category includes B.1.525  B.1.526  P.2  and B.1.427 B.1.429. The WHO provided the alert for last two variants  P.2 and B.1.427 B.1.429  and labeled them for further monitoring. As per the WHO  these variants can be reclassified due to their status at a particular time. At the same time  the CDC  USA  has marked these two variants as VOIs up through today. This article analyzes the evolutionary patterns of all these emerging variants  as well as their geographical distributions and transmission patterns  including the circulating frequency  entropy diversity  and mutational event diversity throughout the genomes of all SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The transmission pattern was observed highest in the B.1.1.7 lineage. Our frequency evaluation found that this lineage achieved 100% frequency in early October 2020. We also critically evaluated the above emerging variants mutational landscape and significant spike protein mutations  E484K  K417T N  N501Y  and D614G  impacting public health. Finally  the effectiveness of vaccines against newly SARS-CoV-2 variants was also analyzed.

Here we investigated in more detail the origin of the major and most widely disseminated SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineage B.1.1.33. We recovered 190 whole viral genomes collected from 13 Brazilian states from February 29 to April 31  2020 and combined them with other B.1.1 genomes collected globally. Our genomic survey confirms that lineage B.1.1.33 is responsible for a variable fraction of the community viral transmissions in Brazilian states  ranging from 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Pernambuco to 80% of those from Rio de Janeiro. We detected a moderate prevalence  5–18%  of lineage B.1.1.33 in some South American countries and a very low prevalence  <1%  in North America  Europe  and Oceania. Our study reveals that lineage B.1.1.33 evolved from an ancestral clade  here designated B.1.1.33-like  that carries one of the two B.1.1.33 synapomorphic mutations. The B.1.1.33-like lineage may have been introduced from Europe or arose in Brazil in early February 2020 and a few weeks later gave origin to the lineage B.1.1.33. These SARS-CoV-2 lineages probably circulated during February 2020 and reached all Brazilian regions and multiple countries around the world by mid-March  before the implementation of air travel restrictions in Brazil. Our phylodynamic analysis also indicates that public health interventions were partially effective to control the expansion of lineage B.1.1.33 in Rio de Janeiro because its median effective reproductive number  R e   was drastically reduced by about 66% during March 2020  but failed to bring it to below one. Continuous genomic surveillance of lineage B.1.1.33 might provide valuable information about epidemic dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions in some Brazilian states.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the transmissibility and virulence of this emergent coronavirus lineage in Brazil.

The pathogenicity of B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.617.3 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated and compared with that of B.1  an early virus isolate with D614G mutation in a Syrian hamster model. Viral load  antibody response  and lung disease were studied. There was no significant difference in the virus shedding pattern among these variants. High levels of SARS-CoV-2 sub genomic RNA were detected in the respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Delta variant for 14 days  which warrants further transmission studies. The Delta variant induced lung disease of moderate severity in about 40% of infected animals  which supports the attributed disease severity of the variant. Cross neutralizing antibodies were detected in animals infected with B.1  Delta  and B.1.617.3 variant  but neutralizing capacity was significantly lower with B.1.351  Beta variant .

Although huge efforts for drug repurposing and compound screens have put forth  only few compounds remain in late stage clinical trials. New approaches and assays are needed to accelerate COVID-19 drug discovery and development. Here we report a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay that detects the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  nucleocapsid protein  NP  produced in infected cells. It uses two specific anti-NP monoclonal antibodies  MAbs  conjugated to donor and acceptor fluorophores that produces a robust ratiometric signal for high throughput screening of large compound collections. Using this assay  we measured a half maximal inhibitory concentration  IC 50   for Remdesivir of 9.3 μM against infection with SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1 2020  WA-1 . The assay also detected SARS-CoV-2 South African  Beta  β   Brazilian Japanese variant P.1  Gamma  γ   and Californian  Epsilon  ε   variants of concern or interest  VoC . Therefore  this homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 NP detection assay can be used for accelerating lead compound discovery for drug development and for evaluating drug efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC.

The present study analyzed the epidemic and evolutionary characteristics of haplotype subtypes or regions based on 1.8 million high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. The estimated ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous changes  Ka Ks  in North America and the United States were always more than 1.0  while the Ka Ks in other continents and countries showed a sharp decline  then a slow increase to 1.0  and a dramatic increase over time. H1  B.1  with the highest substitution rate has become the most dominant haplotype subtype since March 2020 and has evolved into multiple haplotype subtypes with smaller substitution rates. Many evolutionary characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2  such as H3 being the only early haplotype subtype that existed for the shortest time  the global prevalence of H1 and H1-5  B.1.1  within a month after being detected  and many high divergent genome sequences early in February 2020  indicate the missing of early SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. SARS-CoV-2 experienced dynamic selection from December 2019 to August 2021 and has been under strong positive selection since May 2021. Its transmissibility and the ability of immune escape may be greatly enhanced over time. This will bring greater challenges to the control of the pandemic.

Spike-gene dropouts in conventional SARS-CoV-2 PCR systems have been reported over the last weeks as indirect diagnostic evidence for the identification of omicron. Here  we report the combination of PCRs specific for heavily mutated sites in the spike gene and nanopore-based full-length genome sequencing for the rapid and sensitive identification of the first four COVID-19 patients diagnosed in Germany to be infected with omicron on November 28  2021. This study will assist the unambiguous laboratory-based diagnosis and global surveillance for this highly contagious VoC with an unprecedented degree of humoral immune escape. Moreover  we propose that specialized diagnostic laboratories should continuously update their assays for variant-specific PCRs in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 to readily detect and diagnose emerging variants of interest and VoCs. The combination with established nanopore sequencing procedures allows both the rapid confirmation by whole genome sequencing as well as the sensitive identification of newly emerging variants of this pandemic β-coronavirus in years to come.

The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine expresses a stabilized spike protein from the WA1 2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2  and has recently demonstrated protective efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in humans in several geographical regions—including in South Africa  where 95% of sequenced viruses in cases of COVID-19 were the B.1.351 variant 3 . Here we show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Ad26.COV2.S induced lower binding and neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 as compared to WA1 2020  but elicited comparable CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against the WA1 2020  B.1.351  B.1.1.7  P.1 and CAL.20C variants. B.1.351 infection of control rhesus macaques resulted in higher levels of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs than did WA1 2020 infection. Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against both WA1 2020 and B.1.351  although we observed higher levels of virus in vaccinated macaques after B.1.351 challenge. These data demonstrate that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Our findings have important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Two variants of concern  VOCs   Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Gamma  P.1   were first detected in December 2020. While Alpha expanded within an expected rate in January and February 2021  its prevalence among new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  cases started to decrease in March  which coincided with the explosion of Gamma variant incidence all over the country  being responsible for more than 95% of the new cases over the following months. A significantly higher viral load [i.e.  mean cycle threshold  Ct  values] for Gamma in comparison to non-VOC samples was verified by the analysis of a large data set of routine reverse transcription–PCR  RT–PCR  exams. Moreover  the rate of reinfections greatly increased from March 2021 onward  reinforcing the enhanced ability of Gamma to escape the immune response. It is difficult to predict the outcomes of competition between variants since local factors like frequency of introduction and vaccine coverage play a key role. Genomic surveillance is of uttermost importance for the mitigation of the pandemic.

These variants contain mutations at the spike  S  protein receptor binding site  RBD   which affect antibody binding. Current commercially available antibody assays were developed before the VOCs emerged. It is unclear whether the levels of these commercially available antibody assays can predict the neutralizing antibody titers against the VOCs. In this study  we sought to determine the correlation between the binding antibody concentration and microneutralization antibody titer against the beta variant. Methods: This study included 58 COVID-19 patients. The concentrations of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and nucleocapsid  N  protein were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay  respectively. The neutralization antibody titer against the wild type lineage A SARS-CoV-2 and against the beta variant  B.1.351  was determined using a conventional live virus neutralization test. Results: The geometric mean MN titer  GMT  against the beta variant was significantly lower than that against the wild type lineage A virus  5.6 vs. 47.3  p < 0.0001 . The anti-RBD IgG had a better correlation with the neutralizing antibody titer than that of the anti-N IgG assay against the wild type lineage A virus  Spearman rho  0.5901 vs. 0.3827 . However  the correlation between the anti-RBD or the anti-N IgG and the MN titer against the beta variant was poor. Conclusions: Currently available commercial antibody assays may not predict the level of neutralizing antibodies against the variants. A new generation of antibody tests specific for variants are required.

While next-generation-sequencing is routinely performed for surveillance purposes  RT-qPCR can be used to rapidly rule-in or rule-out relevant variants  e.g.  in outbreak scenarios. The objective of this study was to create an adaptable and comprehensive toolset for multiplexed Spike-gene SNP detection  which was applied to screen for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage variants. Methods: We created a broad set of single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP -assays including del-Y144 145  E484K  E484Q  P681H  P681R  L452R  and V1176F based on a highly specific multi-LNA  locked nucleic acid -probe design to maximize mismatch discrimination. As proof-of-concept  a multiplex-test was compiled and validated  SCOV2-617VOC-UCT  including SNP-detection for L452R  P681R  E484K  and E484Q to provide rapid screening capabilities for the novel B.1.617 lineages. Results: For the multiplex-test  SCOV2-617VOC-UCT   the analytic lower limit of detection was determined as 182 IU mL for L452R  144 IU mL for P681R  and 79 IU mL for E484Q. A total of 233 clinical samples were tested with the assay  including various on-target and off-target sequences. All SNPs  179 179 positive  were correctly identified as determined by SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing. Conclusion: The recurrence of SNP locations and flexibility of methodology presented in this study allows for rapid adaptation to current and future variants. Furthermore  the ability to multiplex various SNP-assays into screening panels improves speed and efficiency for variant testing. We show 100% concordance with whole genome sequencing for a B.1.617.2 screening assay on the cobas6800 high-throughput system.

We retrospectively compared the clinical features of adult coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  patients without risk factors for severe COVID-19 who entered residential treatment centers  RTCs  before and after the delta variant outbreak. METHODS: We collected medical information from two RTCs in South Korea. On the basis of nationwide delta variant surveillance  we divided the patients into two groups: 1  the delta-minor group  diagnosed from December 2020–June 2021  detection rate < 10%  and 2  the delta-dominant group  diagnosed during August 2021  detection rate > 90% . After propensity-score matching  the incidences of pneumonia  hospital transfer and need for supplemental oxygen were compared between the groups. In addition  risk factors for hospital transfer were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 1 915 patients were included. The incidence of pneumonia  14.6% vs. 9.2%  P = 0.009   all-cause hospital transfer  10.4% vs. 6.3%  P = 0.020  and COVID-19-related hospital transfer  7.5% vs. 4.8%  P = 0.081  were higher in the delta-dominant group than those in the delta-minor group. In the multivariate analysis  the delta-dominant group was an independent risk factor for all-cause  adjusted odds ratio [aOR]  1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.16–3.13; P = 0.011  and COVID-19-related hospital transfer  aOR  1.86; 95% CI  1.04–3.32; P = 0.036 . CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates were increased in the adult COVID-19 patients during the delta variant nationwide outbreak. Our results showed that the delta variant may be more virulent than previous lineages.

We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma  P.1  variant. Methods: By May 15  2021  238 414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70–79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes  as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0–69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1–19  2021. Findings: The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1–6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19  whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70–79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0–69 year olds up to week 6  and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage  first dose  of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70–79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1–4  compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15–19  respectively. Interpretation: Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals  in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6  an estimated additional 43 802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19.

To investigate the effectiveness of prevention strategies in household settings  CDC partnered with four U.S. jurisdictions to describe Omicron household transmission during November 2021-February 2022. Persons with sequence-confirmed Omicron infection and their household contacts were interviewed. Omicron transmission occurred in 124  67.8%  of 183 households. Among 431 household contacts  227 were classified as having a case of COVID-19  attack rate [AR] = 52.7% .† The ARs among household contacts of index patients who had received a COVID-19 booster dose  of fully vaccinated index patients who completed their COVID-19 primary series within the previous 5 months  and of unvaccinated index patients were 42.7%  47 of 110   43.6%  17 of 39   and 63.9%  69 of 108   respectively. The AR was lower among household contacts of index patients who isolated  41.2%  99 of 240  compared with those of index patients who did not isolate  67.5%  112 of 166   p-value <0.01 . Similarly  the AR was lower among household contacts of index patients who ever wore a mask at home during their potentially infectious period  39.5%  88 of 223  compared with those of index patients who never wore a mask at home  68.9%  124 of 180   p-value <0.01 . Multicomponent COVID-19 prevention strategies  including up-to-date vaccination  isolation of infected persons  and mask use at home  are critical to reducing Omicron transmission in household settings.

Understanding the recognition mechanisms of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  NAbs  against the spike protein is pivotal for developing new vaccines and antibody drugs. Here  we isolated several monoclonal antibodies  MAbs  against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain  S-RBD  from the B cell receptor repertoires of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent. Among these MAbs  the antibody nCoV617 demonstrates the most potent neutralizing activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection  as well as prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies against the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  transgenic mouse model in vivo. The crystal structure of S-RBD in complex with nCoV617 reveals that nCoV617 mainly binds to the back of the “ridge” of RBD and shares limited binding residues with ACE2. Under the background of the S-trimer model  it potentially binds to both “up” and “down” conformations of S-RBD. In vitro mutagenesis assays show that mutant residues found in the emerging new lineage B.1.1.7 of SARS-CoV-2 do not affect nCoV617 binding to the S-RBD. These results provide a new human-sourced neutralizing antibody against the S-RBD and assist vaccine development. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 . The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to global health and the economy  so it is necessary to find safe and effective antibody drugs and treatments. The receptor-binding domain  RBD  in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor. It contains a variety of dominant neutralizing epitopes and is an important antigen for the development of new coronavirus antibodies. The significance of our research lies in the determination of new epitopes  the discovery of antibodies against RBD  and the evaluation of the antibodies’ neutralizing effect. The identified antibodies here may be drug candidates for the development of clinical interventions for SARS-CoV-2.

However  the understanding of household secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving  and updated analysis is needed. OBJECTIVE: To use newly published data to further the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the household. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and reference lists of eligible articles were used to search for records published between October 20  2020  and June 17  2021. No restrictions on language  study design  time  or place of publication were applied. Studies published as preprints were included. STUDY SELECTION: Articles with original data that reported at least 2 of the following factors were included: number of household contacts with infection  total number of household contacts  and secondary attack rates among household contacts. Studies that reported household infection prevalence  which includes index cases   that tested contacts using antibody tests only  and that included populations overlapping with another included study were excluded. Search terms were SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate  household  close contacts  contact transmission  contact attack rate  or family transmission. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed models to obtain SAR estimates and 95% CIs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses  PRISMA  reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall household SAR for SARS-CoV-2  SAR by covariates  contact age  sex  ethnicity  comorbidities  and relationship; index case age  sex  symptom status  presence of fever  and presence of cough; number of contacts; study location; and variant   and SAR by index case identification period. RESULTS: A total of 2722 records  2710 records from database searches and 12 records from the reference lists of eligible articles  published between October 20  2020  and June 17  2021  were identified. Of those  93 full-text articles reporting household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed for eligibility  and 37 studies were included. These 37 new studies were combined with 50 of the 54 studies  published through October 19  2020  from our previous review  4 studies from Wuhan  China  were excluded because their study populations overlapped with another recent study   resulting in a total of 87 studies representing 1 249 163 household contacts from 30 countries. The estimated household SAR for all 87 studies was 18.9%  95% CI  16.2%-22.0% . Compared with studies from January to February 2020  the SAR for studies from July 2020 to March 2021 was higher  13.4% [95% CI  10.7%-16.7%] vs 31.1% [95% CI  22.6%-41.1%]  respectively . Results from subgroup analyses were similar to those reported in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis; however  the SAR was higher to contacts with comorbidities  3 studies; 50.0% [95% CI  41.4%-58.6%]  compared with previous findings  and the estimated household SAR for the B.1.1.7  α  variant was 24.5%  3 studies; 95% CI  10.9%-46.2% . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that the household remains an important site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission  and recent studies have higher household SAR estimates compared with the earliest reports. More transmissible variants and vaccines may be associated with further changes.

In this study  a microchip-based grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonic  GC-FP  assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition  we measured the relative antibody binding toward antigens from the CoV2 virus variants strains B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.351  Beta . Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals  while those against the nucleocapsid  N  protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence and also resolved acute  within hours  increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant  but not B.1.1.7  was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA . Collectively  the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable  rapid  and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to SARS CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination. IMPORTANCE In this work  a novel biosensor technology was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from vaccination against COVID-19 and or from infection with the virus. Importantly  this approach enables quantification of antibody levels  which can provide information about the timing and level of immune response. Due the multiplexed nature of this approach  antibody binding to both the original 2019 SARS CoV-2 strain and variant strains can be performed simultaneously and in a short  30-min  time frame.
doi:10.1128/spectrum.01511-21,Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages Indicates Early Circulation of P.1  Gamma  Variant of Concern in Southern Brazil,doi:10.1128/spectrum.01511-21,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01511-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35171035/,pubmed:35171035,pmc:PMC8849062,Microbiol Spectr,2022,Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages Indicates Early Circulation of P.1  Gamma  Variant of Concern in Southern Brazil,The SARS-CoV-2 P.1 lineage emerged in Amazonas  AM   North Brazil and its evolution has been dynamically reported associated with increased transmissibility and or immune evasion. Here  we evaluated the lineages circulating in 29 cities in Rio Grande do Sul  RS   Southern Brazil between March 2020 and May 2021 and investigated the genetic events associated with the emergence of the P.1. A total of 202 oro nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 specimens from patients during routine hospital care were submitted to whole-genome sequencing. Phylogenetic and Bayesian Evolutionary Analyses of the P.1 lineage were carried out to determine the relationship between sequences from RS and AM and dated their common ancestor and origin. One hundred six  53%  sequences were assigned as P.1 and most carried the 22 lineage-defining mutations. All the P.1 sequences included other important mutations  such as P314L and R203K G204R  and revealed a high genetic diversity in the phylogenetic tree. The time-scaled inference suggests that the oldest P.1 sequences from different Brazilian states share a ancestor with those from AM  but the origin of some sequences from RS is unknown. Further  the common ancestor of sequences from RS is dated to mid-June July 2020  earlier than those previously reported from AM. Our results demonstrate that there is a high degree of genetic diversity among P.1 sequences  which suggests a continuous evolution and community spread of the virus. Although the first P.1 outbreak was reported in AM  the lineage was associated with multiple introductory events and had already been circulating in Southern Brazil prior to November 2020. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 P.1 lineage is associated with increased transmissibility and or immune evasion and presents a dynamic evolution in Brazil. The significance of our research relies in the fact that we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Southern Brazil between March 2020 and May 2021. This evaluation allowed us to detect the genetic events associated with the emergence of the P.1 and its sublineages. This study is important because we were able to establish that the common ancestor of P.1 sequences from Rio Grande do Sul  Southern Brazil  is dated of mid-June July 2020  earlier than the P.1 sequences previously reported from Amazonas  AM  state. Noteworthy  the high degree of genetic diversity among P.1 sequences found in this study suggests a continuous evolution and community spread of the virus. Moreover  the oldest P.1 sequences from different Brazilian states share a ancestor with those from AM.

Testing of infected individuals is crucial for identification and isolation  thereby preventing further spread of the disease. Presently  Taqman™ Reverse Transcription Real Time PCR is considered gold standard  and is the most common technique used for molecular testing of COVID-19  though it requires sophisticated equipments  expertise and is also relatively expensive. OBJECTIVE: Development and optimization of an alternate molecular testing method for the diagnosis of COVID-19  through a two step Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification  RT-LAMP . RESULTS: Primers for LAMP were carefully designed for discrimination from other closely related human pathogenic coronaviruses. Care was also taken that primer binding sites are present in conserved regions of SARS-CoV2. Our analysis shows that the primer binding sites are well conserved in all the variants of concern  VOC  and variants of interest  VOI   notified by World Health Organization  WHO . These lineages include B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2  B.1.427 B.1.429  P.2  B.1.525  P.3  B.1.526 and B.1.617.1. Various DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity were evaluated and conditions were optimized for LAMP amplification and visualization. Different LAMP primer sets were also evaluated using synthetic templates as well as patient samples. CONCLUSION: In a double blind study  the RT-LAMP assay was validated on more than 150 patient samples at two different sites. The RT-LAMP assay appeared to be 89.2% accurate when compared to the Taqman™ rt-RT-PCR assay.

There have been fears that two key mutations seen in the receptor binding domain L452R and E484Q would have additive effects on evasion of neutralising antibodies. We report that spike bearing L452R and E484Q confers modestly reduced sensitivity to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies following either first or second dose. The effect is similar in magnitude to the loss of sensitivity conferred by L452R or E484Q alone. These data demonstrate reduced sensitivity to vaccine elicited neutralising antibodies by L452R and E484Q but lack of synergistic loss of sensitivity.
doi:10.1101/2021.10.18.21264623,SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with vaccine breakthrough in the Delaware Valley through summer 2021,doi:10.1101/2021.10.18.21264623,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.18.21264623v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34704098/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.18.21264623,pubmed:34704098,pmc:PMC8547530,medRxiv,2021,SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with vaccine breakthrough in the Delaware Valley through summer 2021,The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  is the cause of the global outbreak of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population  including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley  including the city of Philadelphia  and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020  all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed  notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7  alpha   with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2  delta  and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs  we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2  delta  showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases  odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11 . Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs  notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha  beta and gamma variants  odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18 . This study thus provides a detailed picture of viral evolution in the Delaware Valley and a geographically matched analysis of vaccine breakthroughs; it also introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating enrichment of viral variants. IMPORTANCE: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly effective at reducing viral infection  hospitalization and death. However  vaccine breakthrough infections have been widely observed  raising the question of whether particular viral variants or viral mutations are associated with breakthrough. Here we report analysis of 2621 surveillance isolates from xsxpeople diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Delaware Valley in South Eastern Pennsylvania  allowing rigorous comparison to 159 vaccine breakthrough case specimens. Our best estimate is a three-fold enrichment for some lineages of delta among breakthroughs  and enrichment of a notable spike substitution  N501Y. We introduce statistical methods that should be widely useful for evaluating vaccine breakthroughs and other viral phenotypes.

Cocktails of monoclonal nAbs can reduce the risk of severe disease if administered early in infection. However  multiple variants of concern  VOCs  have arisen during the pandemic that may escape from nAbs. In this issue of the JCI  Jia Zou  Li Li  and colleagues used yeast display libraries to identify mAbs that bind to Spike proteins with a vast array of single amino acid substitutions. The authors identified mutation-resistant monoclonal nAbs for potential use as therapeutics. Multimerization further improved the potency of selected nAbs. These findings suggest a way forward in development of better nAb cocktails. However  the emergence of the highly mutated omicron  B.1.1.529  variant heightens the importance of finding effective anti–SARS-CoV-2 nAb therapeutics despite rapid viral evolution.

Untill 30 June 2021  10 HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real time RT-PCR  resulting in a 4-month cumulative incidence of 0.005%. The infection was mildly symptomatic in six  60%  and asymptomatic in four  40%  individuals. Among the infected HCWs  eight consenting individuals provided paired NPS and saliva during the course of infection  for the purpose of the analysis performed in the present study. Genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs were investigated using real-time RT-PCR in both biological specimens. The temporal profile of viral load was measured using ddPCR. Viral mutations were also analysed. Subgenomic viral RNA was detected in 8 8  100%  NPS and in 6 8  75%  saliva specimens at the baseline. The expression of subgenomic RNA was observed for up to 7 days in 3 8  38%  symptomatic cases. Moreover  concordance was observed between NPS and saliva in the detection of viral mutations  and both N501Y and 69 70del  associated with the B.1.1.7 variant  were detected in the majority 6 8  75%  of subjects  while the K417T mutation  associated with the P.1-type variants  was detected in 2 8  25%  individuals. Overall  our findings report a low frequency of infected HCWs after full vaccination. It is  therefore  important to monitor the vaccinees in order to identify asymptomatic infected individuals. Saliva can be a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance  particularly in social settings such as hospitals.

Unfortunately  towards the end of 2020  the number of daily new cases exponentially increased. Herein  we analyzed the country-wide genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 and April 2021. We identified that the most prevalent viral variant during the first epidemic wave in Uruguay  December 2020–February 2021  was a B.1.1.28 sublineage carrying Spike mutations Q675H + Q677H  now designated as P.6  followed by lineages P.2 and P.7. P.6 probably arose around November 2020  in Montevideo  Uruguay’s capital department  and rapidly spread to other departments  with evidence of further local transmission clusters; it also spread sporadically to the USA and Spain. The more efficient dissemination of lineage P.6 with respect to P.2 and P.7 and the presence of mutations  Q675H and Q677H  in the proximity of the key cleavage site at the S1 S2 boundary suggest that P.6 may be more transmissible than other lineages co-circulating in Uruguay. Although P.6 was replaced by the variant of concern  VOC  P.1 as the predominant lineage in Uruguay since April 2021  the monitoring of the concurrent emergence of Q675H + Q677H in VOCs should be of worldwide interest.

It was found that the B.1.1.7  also 501Y.V1  variant first detected in the UK 4 5  could be serendipitously detected by the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses  spike Δ69-70  would cause a “spike gene target failure”  SGTF  result. However  a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7  and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern that lack spike Δ69-70  such as B.1.351  also 501Y.V2  detected in South Africa 6  and P.1  also 501Y.V3  recently detected in Brazil 7 . We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene  ORF1a Δ3675-3677  in all three variants  which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a Δ3675-3677 as the primary target and spike Δ69-70 to differentiate  we designed and validated an open source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 8 . Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence spread of B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1.

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries  this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40–80 %  Volz et al.  2021; Leung et al.  2021; Davies et al.  2021 . AIM: This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland. METHODS: We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data  we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variant’s transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale. RESULTS: We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43–52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further  we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period  compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically  we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07–1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06–1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021  once B.1.1.7 was dominant  we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00–1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference  Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers  B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2–3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7  our plots are available online.

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay  ~1500 bps  to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  including the three Variants of Concern  VOCs  20I 501Y.V1  United Kingdom   20H 501Y.V2  South Africa   and 20 J 501Y.V3  Brazil   as well as the 20E.EU1 variant  Spain   the CAL.20C recently identified in California  and the mink-associated variant  GR  lineage B.1.1.298 . Prior to application to field samples  the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage  where the amplification of long fragments is problematic  two short nested RT-PCR assays  ~300 bps  were also designed  targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay. The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples  including 31 clinical samples  7 fully-sequenced swab samples  and 24 uncharacterized ones  and 34 urban wastewater samples  some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported. The long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs  93%   allowing the correct identification of variants 20I 501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples. The Spanish variant was detected in 14 24 of the uncharacterized samples as well. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs  UK and Brazilian variant  and of other variant  Spanish  were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge  this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I 501Y.V1 and 20 J 501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters  highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity  geographic distribution and impact worldwide.

We estimated case fatality rate  cumulative recovery number  basic reproduction number  R 0   and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31  2020  Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R 0  calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection  a 20% change in R 0  with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L  O  S  G  GH  where predominant circulating clade was GR  83.9%; 245 292 . The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters  I to XIII  with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation  respectively. The Spike  Nucleocapsid  NSP2  and RdRP showed substantially high mutation and no mutation recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike  S  protein  355 predominant mutations were recorded  highest in D614G. Alternatively  I120F in NSP2 protein  R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein  and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A  B  B.1  B.1.1  B.1.1.23  B.1.1.25  B.1.113  and B.1.36  among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study indicates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2  and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommended continuous monitoring of R 0  and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.

Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection  similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2–infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7  alpha  and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146 243 tested contacts of 108 498 index patients  54 667  37%  had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction  PCR  tests. In index patients who became infected with the alpha variant  two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  also known as AZD1222   as compared with no vaccination  were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts  adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2  0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]  0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  0.48; 95% CI  0.30 to 0.78 . Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant  and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater  adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination  0.50; 95% CI  0.39 to 0.65  than after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations  adjusted rate ratio  0.76; 95% CI  0.70 to 0.82 . Variation in cycle-threshold  Ct  values  indicative of viral load  in index patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination  reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant  and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission.  Funded by the U.K. Government Department of Health and Social Care and others.

The E484K mutation in SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be responsible for weakened humoral immunity. Vaccine efficacy against the R.1 lineage  which contains the E484K mutation but not the N501Y mutation  is uncertain. Serum samples were collected from 100 healthy Japanese participants three weeks after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine  and serum neutralization antibody titers were measured against five SARS-CoV-2 variants. The geometric mean neutralization titers measured for the original and R.1 lineages were equivalent  91.90 ± 2.40 and 102.67 ± 2.28  respectively   whereas a low titer was measured for the beta variant  18.03 ± 1.92 . Although further investigations with other variant strains and serum samples are essential  our results imply that the weakened humoral response is not caused solely by the E484K mutation.

It is characterized by the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain  which could contribute to the evasion from neutralizing antibodies. In Italy  this variant was first identified in January 2021. Here  we report an autochthonous outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant infections in southern Italy in subjects who had not travelled to endemic areas or outside the Apulia region. The outbreak involved seven subjects  three of whom had received a COVID-19 vaccine  one had received two doses and two had received one dose . Four patients had a mild clinical presentation. Laboratory investigations of nasopharyngeal swabs revealed that all strains were S-gene target failure-negative and molecular tests revealed they were the P.1 variant. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that five subjects were infected with closely related strains classified as the P.1 lineage. The circulation of VOCs highlights the importance of strictly monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants through genomic surveillance and of investigating local outbreaks. Furthermore  public health measures including social distancing  screening  and quarantine for travelers are key tools to slow down the viral transmission and to contain and mitigate the impact of VOC diffusion  and rapid scaling-up of vaccination is crucial to avoid a possible new epidemic wave.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the desirable features and applications of telemedical services for the Polish older adults delivered by wearable medical devices. The questionnaire study was conducted among 146 adult volunteers in two cohorts  C.1: <65 years vs. C.2: ≥65 years . The analysis was based on qualitative research and descriptive statistics. Comparisons were performed by Pearson’s chi-squared test. The questionnaire  which was divided into three parts  1-socio-demographic data  needs  and behaviors; 2-health status; 3-telemedicine service awareness and device concept study   consisted of 37 open  semi-open  or closed questions. Two cohorts were analyzed  C.1: n = 77; mean age = 32 vs. C.2: n = 69; mean age = 74 . The performed survey showed that the majority of respondents were unaware of the telemedical services  56.8% . A total of 62.3% of C.1 and 34.8% of C.2 declared their understanding of telemedical services. The 10.3% of correct explanations regarding telemedical service were found among all study participants. The most desirable feature was the detection of life-threatening and health-threatening situations  65.2% vs. 66.2% . The findings suggest a lack of awareness of telemedical services and the opportunities offered by wearable telemedical devices.

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody  mAb  therapeutics have received emergency use authorization 1 2   and more are in the pipeline 3–6 . Furthermore  multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise 7   including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19 8 9 . However  these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since  including variants with a D614G mutation 10  that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct  however 11 . Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK 12  and B.1.351 in South Africa 13  is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain  NTD  of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain  RBD . It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma  ~3 fold  and vaccinee sera  ~2 fold . Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD  largely due to an E484K mutation. Moreover  B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma  ~11–33 fold  and vaccinee sera  ~6.5–8.6 fold . B.1.351 and emergent variants 14 15  with similar spike mutations present new challenges for mAb therapy and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines.

There is a lack of experimental evidence to explain how these natural occurring variants spread more efficiently than existing strains of SARS-CoV-2 in transmission. We found that the Alpha variant  B.1.1.7  increased competitive fitness over earlier parental D614G lineages in in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Using hamster transmission model  we further demonstrated that the Alpha variant is able to replicate and shed more efficiently in the nasal cavity of hamsters than other variants with low dose and short duration of exposure. The capability to initiate effective infection with low inocula may be one of the key factors leading to the rapid transmission of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: We conducted the final analysis in the double-blind phase of our multinational  randomized  placebo-controlled trial  in which adults were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive single-dose Ad26.COV2.S  5×10 10  viral particles  or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration and at least 28 days after administration in the per-protocol population. Safety and key secondary and exploratory end points were also assessed. RESULTS: Median follow-up in this analysis was 4 months; 8940 participants had at least 6 months of follow-up. In the per-protocol population  39 185 participants   vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 at least 14 days after administration was 56.3%  95% confidence interval [CI]  51.3 to 60.8; 484 cases in the vaccine group vs. 1067 in the placebo group ; at least 28 days after administration  vaccine efficacy was 52.9%  95% CI  47.1 to 58.1; 433 cases in the vaccine group vs. 883 in the placebo group . Efficacy in the United States  primarily against the reference strain  B.1.D614G  and the B.1.1.7  alpha  variant  was 69.7%  95% CI  60.7 to 76.9 ; efficacy was reduced elsewhere against the P.1  gamma   C.37  lambda   and B.1.621  mu  variants. Efficacy was 74.6%  95% CI  64.7 to 82.1  against severe–critical Covid-19  with only 4 severe–critical cases caused by the B.1.617.2 [delta] variant   75.6%  95% CI  54.3 to 88.0  against Covid-19 leading to medical intervention  including hospitalization   and 82.8%  95% CI  40.5 to 96.8  against Covid-19–related death  with protection lasting 6 months or longer. Efficacy against any severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection was 41.7%  95% CI  36.3 to 46.7 . Ad26.COV2.S was associated with mainly mild-to-moderate adverse events  and no new safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S provided 52.9% protection against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19. Protection varied according to variant; higher protection was observed against severe Covid-19  medical intervention  and death than against other end points and lasted for 6 months or longer.

In the United States  the BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorized for use in children and adolescents aged 5-15 years under an Emergency Use Authorization and is fully licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for persons aged ≥16 years  4 . Prelicensure randomized trials in persons aged ≥5 years documented high vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity  5  § and real-world studies in persons aged 12-18 years demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness  VE  against severe COVID-19  6 . Recent evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower MIS-C incidence among adolescents  7 ; however  VE of the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech regimen against MIS-C has not been evaluated. The effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received ≥28 days before hospital admission in preventing MIS-C was assessed using a test-negative case-control design¶ among hospitalized patients aged 12-18 years at 24 pediatric hospitals in 20 states** during July 1-December 9  2021  the period when most MIS-C patients could be temporally linked to SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant predominance. Patients with MIS-C  case-patients  and two groups of hospitalized controls matched to case-patients were evaluated: test-negative controls had at least one COVID-19-like symptom and negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  or antigen-based assay results  and syndrome-negative controls were hospitalized patients without COVID-19-like illness. Among 102 MIS-C case-patients and 181 hospitalized controls  estimated effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against MIS-C was 91%  95% CI = 78%-97% . All 38 MIS-C patients requiring life support were unvaccinated. Receipt of 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is associated with a high level of protection against MIS-C in persons aged 12-18 years  highlighting the importance of vaccination among all eligible children.

Whether rapid point-of-care antigen lateral flow devices  LFDs  detect most potential transmission sources despite imperfect clinical sensitivity is unknown. METHODS: We combined SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing data from England between 01-September-2020 and 28-February-2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate relationships between PCR-confirmed infection in contacts of community-diagnosed cases and index case viral load  S gene target failure  proxy for B.1.1.7 infection   demographics  SARS-CoV-2 incidence  social deprivation  and contact event type. We used LFD performance to simulate the proportion of cases with a PCR-positive contact expected to be detected using one of four LFDs. RESULTS: 231 498 2 474 066 9%  contacts of 1 064 004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads  lower Ct values  e.g.  11.7% 95%CI 11.5-12.0%  at Ct=15 and 4.5% 4.4-4.6%  at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by ~50%   e.g. 1.55-fold  95%CI 1.49-1.61  at Ct=20 . PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts  at Ct=20.1  8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]   followed by household visitors  7.1%[6.8-7.3%]   contacts at events activities  5.2%[4.9-5.4%]   work education  4.6%[4.4-4.8%]   and least common after outdoor contact  2.9%[2.3-3.8%] . Contacts of children were the least likely to test positive  particularly following contact outdoors or at work education. The most and least sensitive LFDs would detect 89.5% 89.4-89.6%  and 83.0% 82.8-83.1%  of cases with PCR-positive contacts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies by case viral load  contact event type  and age. Those with high viral loads are the most infectious. B.1.1.7 increased transmission by ~50%. The best performing LFDs detect most infectious cases.

During April 2021  the city became overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and fatalities  as a new variant B.1.617.2  Delta  replaced B.1.1.7  Alpha . A Bayesian model explains the growth advantage of Delta through a combination of increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to immune responses generated against earlier variants  median estimates; ×1.5-fold  20% reduction . Seropositivity of an employee and family cohort increased from 42% to 87.5% between March and July 2021  with 27% reinfections  as judged by increased antibody concentration after a previous decline. The likely high transmissibility and partial evasion of immunity by the Delta variant contributed to an overwhelming surge in Delhi.

The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor  ACE2  of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process  the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the S protein plays an essential role  since it contains the receptor binding motif  RBM   responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far  mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2. Here we show  with the help of atomistic simulations  that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein  inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets  believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2  undergo a change into an unstructured coil  which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor. We also show that these severe structural changes upon electric-field application also occur in the mutant RBDs corresponding to the variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  UK   B.1.351  South Africa  and P.1  Brazil . Remarkably  while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell  it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus without further biochemical processing. Moreover  the effect could be used for infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific  it can be suitable for application to other mutations in S  to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and in general to membrane proteins of other virus types.

Here  we compare the neutralization of variants of concern  including B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.1.529  Omicron  in sera from individuals exposed to variant infection  vaccination  or both. We demonstrate that neutralizing antibody responses are strongest against variants sharing certain spike mutations with the immunizing exposure. We also observe that exposure to multiple spike variants increases the breadth of variant cross-neutralization. These findings contribute to understanding relationships between exposures and antibody responses and may inform booster vaccination strategies.

Soluble decoy receptors  in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity  potently neutralize infection and  due to close similarity with the natural receptor  hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here  we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor  sACE2 2 .v2.4  tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats  despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain  RBD  followed by in vitro selection  with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites  failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD  which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage  B.1.1.7  in England  enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to engineered sACE22.v2.4. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.

While recent cell culture experiments have demonstrated loss of potency of several anti-spike neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains1-3  the in vivo significance of these results remains uncertain. Here  using a panel of monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  corresponding to many in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology  AbbVie  AstraZeneca  Regeneron  and Lilly we report the impact on protection in animals against authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including WA1 2020 strains  a B.1.1.7 isolate  and chimeric strains with South African  B.1.351  or Brazilian  B.1.1.28  spike genes. Although some individual mAbs showed reduced or abrogated neutralizing activity against B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 viruses with E484K spike protein mutations in cell culture  low prophylactic doses of mAb combinations protected against infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice  129S2 immunocompetent mice  and hamsters without emergence of resistance. Two exceptions were mAb LY-CoV555 monotherapy which lost all protective activity in vivo  and AbbVie 2B04 47D11  which showed partial loss of activity. When administered after infection as therapy  higher doses of mAb cocktails protected in vivo against viruses displaying a B.1.351 spike gene. Thus  many  but not all  of the antibody products with Emergency Use Authorization should retain substantial efficacy against the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.

Material and Methods: In this retrospective study  non-hospitalized pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs  NPS  were enrolled at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health-IRCCS Burlo Garofolo  Trieste  Italy   from November 2020 to January 2022. SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified by in vitro viral isolation  amplification  automatic sequencing of the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike coding gene  and subsequent next-generation sequencing. The growth curves of the isolated strains were defined in vitro by infecting Vero-E6 cells and quantifying the viral load in the supernatants up to 72 h post-infection by qRT–PCR. The neutralization activity of sera obtained from a COVID-19 vaccinated subject  recovered  2020  patient  vaccinated and recovered  2021  patient  and seronegative subject was assessed by microneutralization assay against the different variants. Results: In total  32 SARS-CoV-2-positive children  16  50%  females  with a median age of 1.4 years  range: 1 day–13 years   were enrolled. The D614G amino acid substitution was detected in all isolated and amplified viral strains. Of the 32 isolates  4  12.5%  carried a nonsynonymous nucleotide mutation leading to the N439K  3 4   lineage B.1.258  ∆H69 ∆V70   and S477N  1 4  substitution. In 7 32  21.8%  isolates  amino acid substitutions allowed the identification of a delta variant  lineage B.1.617.2-AY.43  and in 1 32  3.1%   the Omicron strain  B.1.1.529.BA1  was identified. The growth curves of the B.1  B.1.258  ∆H69 ∆V70   B.1.617.2-AY.43  and B.1.1.529.BA1 variants did not show any significant differences. A reduction in the serum neutralizing activity against B.1.258  ∆H69 ∆V70  only in a vaccinated subject  1.7-fold difference   against B.1.617.2-AY.43 in a vaccinated subject and in recovered patients  12.7 and ≥2.5-fold differences  respectively   and against B.1.1.529.BA1 variant  57.6- and 1.4-fold differences in vaccinated and in vaccinated and recovered patients  were observed compared to the B.1 variant. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the B.1.258  ∆H69 ∆V70  and S477N substitutions were reported here in a pediatric population for the first time. Although the growth rates of the isolated strains  B.1.258  B.1.617.2-AY.43  B.1.1.529.BA1  did not differ from the B.1 variant  neutralizing activity of the sera from vaccinated subjects significantly decreased against these variants. Attention should be devoted to the pediatric population to prevent the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in an unvaccinated and predominantly naive population.

However  data for individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who are taking immunosuppressants remains scarce. Our previously published cohort study showed that methotrexate  but not targeted biologics  impaired functional humoral immunity to a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech   whereas cellular responses were similar. Here  we aimed to assess immune responses following the second dose. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study  we recruited individuals with psoriasis who were receiving methotrexate or targeted biological monotherapy  ie  tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors  interleukin [IL]-17 inhibitors  or IL-23 inhibitors  from a specialist psoriasis centre serving London and South-East England. The healthy control cohort were volunteers without psoriasis  not receiving immunosuppression. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before  on day 28 after the first BNT162b2 vaccination and on day 14 after the second dose  administered according to an extended interval regimen . Here  we report immune responses following the second dose. The primary outcomes were humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  defined as titres of total spike-specific IgG and of neutralising antibody to wild-type  alpha  B.1.1.7   and delta  B.1.617.2  SARS-CoV-2 variants  and cellular immunity defined as spike-specific T-cell responses  including numbers of cells producing interferon-γ  IL-2  IL-21 . FINDINGS: Between Jan 14 and April 4  2021  121 individuals were recruited  and data were available for 82 participants after the second vaccination. The study population included patients with psoriasis receiving methotrexate  n=14   TNF inhibitors  n=19   IL-17 inhibitors  n=14   IL-23 inhibitors  n=20   and 15 healthy controls  who had received both vaccine doses. The median age of the study population was 44 years  IQR 33–52   with 43  52%  males and 71  87%  participants of White ethnicity. All participants had detectable spike-specific antibodies following the second dose  and all groups  methotrexate  targeted biologics  and healthy controls  demonstrated similar neutralising antibody titres against wild-type  alpha  and delta variants. By contrast  a lower proportion of participants on methotrexate  eight [62%] of 13  95% CI 32–86  and targeted biologics  37 [74%] of 50  60–85; p=0·38  had detectable T-cell responses following the second vaccine dose  compared with controls  14 [100%] of 14  77–100; p=0·022 . There was no difference in the magnitude of T-cell responses between patients receiving methotrexate  median cytokine-secreting cells per 10 6  cells 160 [IQR 10–625]   targeted biologics  169 [25–503]  p=0·56   and controls  185 [133–328]  p=0·41 . INTERPRETATION: Functional humoral immunity  ie  neutralising antibody responses  at 14 days following a second dose of BNT162b2 was not impaired by methotrexate or targeted biologics. A proportion of patients on immunosuppression did not have detectable T-cell responses following the second dose. The longevity of vaccine-elicited antibody responses is unknown in this population.

Several tools and protocols have been shared since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  but they need to be timely adapted to cope with SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Although whole-genome sequencing  WGS  of the virus genetic material has been widely used  it still presents practical difficulties such as high cost  shortage of available reagents in the global market  need of a specialized laboratorial infrastructure and well-trained staff. These limitations result in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance blackouts across several countries. Here we propose a rapid and accessible protocol based on Sanger sequencing of a single PCR fragment that is able to identify and discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs  identified so far  according to each characteristic mutational profile at the Spike-RBD region  K417N T  E484K  N501Y  A570D . Twelve COVID-19 samples from Brazilian patients were evaluated for both WGS and Sanger sequencing: three P.2  two P.1  six B.1.1 and one B.1.1.117 lineage. All results from the Sanger sequencing method perfectly matched the mutational profile of VOCs and non-VOCs RBD's characterized by WGS. In summary  this approach allows a much broader network of laboratories to perform molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and report results within a shorter time frame  which is of utmost importance in the context of rapid public health decisions in a fast evolving worldwide pandemic.

Our study demonstrates the administration of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine that elicited a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response which was assessed up to 3 months after full vaccination in a cohort of 37 health care workers  HCWs . SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response  evaluated by four commercially available chemiluminescence immunoassays  CLIA   was qualitatively consistent with the results provided by the gold-standard in vitro neutralization assay  NTA . However  we could not observe a correlation between the quantity of the antibody detected by CLIA assays and their neutralizing activity tested by NTA. Almost all subjects developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response. Moreover  vaccinated HCWs developed a similar protective neutralizing antibodies response against the EU  B.1   Alpha  B.1.1.7   Gamma  P.1   and Eta  B.1.525  SARS-CoV-2 variants  while Beta  B.1.351  and Delta  B.1.617.2  strains displayed a consistent partial immune evasion. These results underline the importance of a solid vaccine-elicited immune response and a robust antibody titre. We believe that these relevant results should be taken into consideration in the definition of future vaccinal strategies.

This study aimed to explore the factors associated with B.1.1.7 VOC infection in the context of vaccination. On March 2021  we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal samples from 14 of 22 individuals vaccinated with a single-dose of ChAdOx1  outbreak A  n = 26   and 22 of 42 of individuals with two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine  outbreak B  n = 52  for breakthrough infection rates for ChAdOx1 of 63.6% and 52.4% for CoronaVac. The outbreaks were caused by two independent clusters of the B.1.1.7 VOC. The serum of PCR-positive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals had ~1.8–3.4-fold more neutralizing capacity against B.1.1.7 compared to the serum of asymptomatic individuals. These data based on exploratory analysis suggest that the B.1.1.7 variant can infect individuals partially immunized with a single dose of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine or fully immunized with two doses of an inactivated vaccine  although the vaccines were able to reduce the risk of severe disease and death caused by this VOC  even in the elderly.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate inactivated vaccine effectiveness  VE  against the B.1.617.2 variant. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was based on the first outbreak of the B.1.617.2 variant in mainland China that was discovered and traced in Guangdong in May and June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 10 805 adult case patients with laboratory-confirmed infection and close contacts. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were categorized as unvaccinated  partially vaccinated  1 dose   and fully vaccinated  2 doses . We estimated VE against the primary outcome of pneumonia and the secondary outcomes of infections  symptomatic infections  and severe or critical illness associated with the B.1.617.2 variant. RESULTS: Results are reported in the order of outcome severity. Of 10 805 participants  1.3% contracted infections  1.2% developed symptomatic infections  1.1% had pneumonia  and 0.2% had severe or critical illness. The adjusted VEs of full vaccination were 51.8%  95% CI  20.3% to 83.2%  against infection  60.4%  CI  31.8% to 88.9%  against symptomatic infection  and 78.4%  CI  56.9% to 99.9%  against pneumonia. Also  full vaccination was 100%  CI  98.4% to 100.0%  effective against severe or critical illness. By contrast  the adjusted VEs of partial vaccination against infection  symptomatic infection  and pneumonia were 10.7%  CI  −41.2% to 62.6%   6.8%  CI  −47.4% to 61.0%   and 11.6%  CI  −42.6% to 65.8%   respectively. LIMITATION: Observational study with possible unmeasured confounders; insufficient data to do reliable subgroup analyses by age and vaccine brand. CONCLUSION: Full vaccination with inactivated vaccines is effective against the B.1.617.2 variant. Effort should be made to ensure full vaccination of target populations.

By the end of November 2021  it had spread and approached fixation in South Africa  and had been detected on all continents. We analyzed the exponential growth of Omicron over four-week periods in the two most populated of South Africa’s provinces  Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal  arriving at the doubling time estimates of  respectively  3.3 days  95% CI: 3.2–3.4 days  and 2.7 days  95% CI: 2.3–3.3 days . Similar or even shorter doubling times were observed in other locations: Australia  3.0 days   New York State  2.5 days   UK  2.4 days   and Denmark  2.0 days . Log–linear regression suggests that the spread began in Gauteng around 11 October 2021; however  due to presumable stochasticity in the initial spread  this estimate can be inaccurate. Phylogenetics-based analysis indicates that the Omicron strain started to diverge between 6 October and 29 October 2021. We estimated that the weekly growth of the ratio of Omicron to Delta is in the range of 7.2–10.2  considerably higher than the growth of the ratio of Delta to Alpha  estimated to be in in the range of 2.5–4.2   and Alpha to pre-existing strains  estimated to be in the range of 1.8–2.7 . High relative growth does not necessarily imply higher Omicron infectivity. A two-strain SEIR model suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron may stem from immune evasion  which permits this VOC to infect both recovered and fully vaccinated individuals. As we demonstrated within the model  immune evasion is more concerning than increased transmissibility  because it can facilitate larger epidemic outbreaks.

In this study  clinical and virological findings of five mildly symptomatic pregnant women and their infected fetuses newborns treated at a referral hospital for COVID19-pregnant women in Midwestern Brazil are reported. Mother and fetal samples were tested by RT-qPCR  ECLIA and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. From the five cases  one resulted in spontaneous abortion  one was stillborn  two were preterm births and one full-term birth. Maternal and fetal placenta  newborn and stillborn secretions were SARS-CoV-2+; one neonate developed ground-glass opacities in his lungs. One neonate’s umbilical cord was IgG+ and all were IgM negative upon hospital discharge. Genomes recovered from two placentas belong to the B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 lineages and present nonsynonymous mutations associated with virus fitness and infectivity; other not frequently reported mutations  B.1.1.33: NSP3 V2090G  M A2S and ORF3ab S253P and Y264N; B.1.1.28: NSP3 E995D  NSP12 R240K  NSP14 H1897Y and in ORF7b V21F  were found in proteins involved in viral replication  viral induction of apoptosis  viral interference on interferon and on NF-Κβ pathways. Phylogeny indicates the south of Brazil as the possible origin of these lineages circulating in MT. These findings contribute to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes in pregnant women and their fetuses  at any stage of gestation and even in mild symptomatic cases.

A Mathematical Modelling Approach for Estimating the Spread of B.1.1.7 Using Ontario  Canada  as a Case Study,doi:10.3390/vaccines9060592,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204918/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060592,pubmed:34204918,pmc:PMC8227606,Vaccines (Basel),2021,Could a New COVID-19 Mutant Strain Undermine Vaccination Efforts? A Mathematical Modelling Approach for Estimating the Spread of B.1.1.7 Using Ontario  Canada  as a Case Study,Infections represent highly dynamic processes  characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents  viruses  such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2  SARS-CoV-2   the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-2019  pandemic  have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent  it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new  more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world  it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore  we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to take over a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. In this study  we used COVID-19 as a case-study; however  the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogen. We devised a two-strain mathematical framework to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model  using Ontario as a case study. We found that  in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels  a variant strain was unlikely to dominate until March April 2021. The current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains  then it is still possible to achieve high levels of immunity in the population by the end of 2021. Our findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy- and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.

Herein  we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell–cell contact in cultures  mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than is SARS-CoV spike  which reflects  in part  their differential cell–cell fusion activity. Interestingly  treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission  implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection  cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission  we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably  despite differences in cell-free infectivity  the authentic variants of concern  VOCs  B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.351  beta  have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover  B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection  whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccinee sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall  our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission  with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.

Whether a positive test is associated with a high viral RNA load  specific viral variant  recovery of infectious virus  or symptomatic infection is largely not known. METHODS: In this study  we identified 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who had received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech  BNT162b2  or Moderna  mRNA-1273  vaccines  the 2nd of which was received between January and April of 2021. The positive samples were collected between January and May of 2021 with a time that extended from 2 to 100 days after the second dose. Samples were sequenced to characterize the whole genome and Spike protein changes and cycle thresholds that reflect viral loads were determined using a single molecular assay. Local SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were examined using ELISA and specimens were grown on cell culture to assess the recovery of infectious virus as compared to a control unvaccinated cohort from a matched time frame. RESULTS: Of 133 specimens  24 failed sequencing and yielded a negative or very low viral load on the repeat PCR. Of 109 specimens that were used for further genome analysis  68  62.4%  were from symptomatic infections  11  10.1%  were admitted for COVID-19  and 2  1.8%  required ICU admission with no associated mortality. The predominant virus variant was the alpha  B.1.1.7   however a significant association between lineage B.1.526 and amino acid change S: E484K with positives after vaccination was noted when genomes were compared to a large control cohort from a matched time frame. A significant reduction of the recovery of infectious virus on cell culture as well as delayed time to the first appearance of cytopathic effect was accompanied by an increase in local IgG levels in respiratory samples of vaccinated individuals but upper respiratory tract IgG levels were not different between symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination reduces the recovery of infectious virus in breakthrough infections accompanied by an increase in upper respiratory tract local immune responses.

Several forecasting models have been developed based on the data acquired within the early stages of the virus spread. However  with the recent emergence of new virus variants  it is unclear how the new strains could influence the efficiency of forecasting using models adopted using earlier data. In this study  we analyzed daily positive cases  DPC  data using a machine learning model to understand the effect of new viral variants on morbidity rates. A deep learning model that considers several environmental and mobility factors was used to forecast DPC in six districts of Japan. From machine learning predictions with training data since the early days of COVID-19  high-quality estimation has been achieved for data obtained earlier than March 2021. However  a significant upsurge was observed in some districts after the discovery of the new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7  Alpha . An average increase of 20–40% in DPC was observed after the emergence of the Alpha variant and an increase of up to 20% has been recognized in the effective reproduction number. Approximately four weeks was needed for the machine learning model to adjust the forecasting error caused by the new variants. The comparison between machine-learning predictions and reported values demonstrated that the emergence of new virus variants should be considered within COVID-19 forecasting models. This study presents an easy yet efficient way to quantify the change caused by new viral variants with potential usefulness for global data analysis.

Unfortunately  several SARS-CoV-2 variants  especially variants of concern  VOCs   are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera  raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels are a reliable correlate of vaccine-mediated protection. However  currently used BSL3-based virus micro-neutralization  MN  assays are more laborious  time-consuming  and expensive  underscoring the need for BSL2-based  cost-effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need  we have developed a BSL-2 pseudovirus-based neutralization assay  PBNA  in cells expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  hACE2  receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible  R 2  = 0.96   demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggest that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20 130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 SA  South Africa  and B.1.1.7 UK  United Kingdom  VOC  whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants. SARS-CoV-2 spike PBNAs for VOCs would be useful tools to measure the neutralization ability of candidate vaccines in both preclinical models and clinical trials and would further help develop effective prophylactic countermeasures against emerging neutralization escape phenotypes.

It is hence important to continue searching for SARS-CoV-2 broadly neutralizing MAbs and defining their epitopes. Here  we isolate 9 neutralizing mouse MAbs raised against the spike protein of a SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and evaluate their neutralizing potency towards a panel of variants  including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617.1  and B.1.617.2. By using a combination of biochemical  virological  and cryo-EM structural analyses  we identify three types of cross-variant neutralizing MAbs  represented by S5D2  S5G2  and S3H3  respectively  and further define their epitopes. S5D2 binds the top lateral edge of the receptor-binding motif within the receptor-binding domain  RBD  with a binding footprint centred around the loop 477–489   and efficiently neutralizes all variant pseudoviruses  but the potency against B.1.617.2 was observed to decrease significantly. S5G2 targets the highly conserved RBD core region and exhibits comparable neutralization towards the variant panel. S3H3 binds a previously unreported epitope located within the evolutionarily stable SD1 region and is able to near equally neutralize all of the variants tested. Our work thus defines three distinct cross-variant neutralizing sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  providing guidance for design and development of broadly effective vaccines and MAb-based therapies.

Till date  several variants of concern have been identified. However  currently  the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  is the most dreaded one owing to its enhanced transmissibility and increased virulence. In addition  this variant can potentially facilitate fusion of the spike protein to cells or inhibit antibodies from binding to it. In this commentary  we have simplified the complexity of the nomenclature of variants related to COVID-19  concentrating on the Delta variant including its transmissibility  response to vaccines  and prevention.

In mice  NARUVAX-C19 vaccine administered intramuscularly twice at 21-day interval elicited balanced Th1 Th2 humoral and T-cell responses with high titers of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type  D614G  and delta  B.1.617.2  variants. In Syrian hamsters  NARUVAX-C19 provided complete protection against wild-type  D614G  infection and prevented its transmission to naïve animals  n = 2 group  placed in the same cage as challenged animals  n = 6 group . The results contrasted with only weak protection seen with a monomeric spike receptor-binding domain  RBD  vaccine even when formulated with the same adjuvant. These encouraging results warrant the ongoing development of this COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

To date  studies assessing whether COVID-19 during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for stillbirth have yielded mixed results  2-4 . Since the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  became the predominant circulating variant * there have been anecdotal reports of increasing rates of stillbirths in women with COVID-19.† CDC used the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release  PHD-SR   a large hospital-based administrative database § to assess whether a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis documented at delivery hospitalization was associated with stillbirth during March 2020-September 2021 as well as before and during the period of Delta variant predominance in the United States  March 2020-June 2021 and July-September 2021  respectively .

This disease  currently named COVID-19  has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization  WHO . The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6  2020. Here we characterize an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the pandemic recovered in April  2020. OBJECTIVE: To describe the isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the epidemic in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nasopharyngeal specimen from a COVID-19 positive patient was inoculated on different cell lines. To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on cultures we used qRT-PCR  indirect immunofluorescence assay  transmission and scanning electron microscopy  and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: We determined the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells by the appearance of the cytopathic effect three days post-infection and confirmed it by the positive results in the qRT-PCR and the immunofluorescence with convalescent serum. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy images obtained from infected cells showed the presence of structures compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Finally  a complete genome sequence obtained by next-generation sequencing allowed classifying the isolate as B.1.5 lineage. CONCLUSION: The evidence presented in this article confirms the first isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia. In addition  it shows that this strain behaves in cell culture in a similar way to that reported in the literature for other isolates and that its genetic composition is consistent with the predominant variant in the world. Finally  points out the importance of viral isolation for the detection of neutralizing antibodies  for the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the strain and for testing compounds with antiviral potential.

Cross-neutralizing activity against major variants of concern  B.1.1.7  P.1 and B.1.351  has been observed following vaccination  albeit at a reduced potency  but whether vaccines based on the Spike glycoprotein of these viral variants will produce a superior cross-neutralizing antibody response has not been fully investigated. Here  we used sera from individuals infected in wave 1 in the UK to study the long-term cross-neutralization up to 10 months post onset of symptoms  POS   as well as sera from individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 variant to compare cross-neutralizing activity profiles. We show that neutralizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity can be detected from wave 1 up to 10 months POS. Although neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 is lower  the difference in neutralization potency decreases at later timepoints suggesting continued antibody maturation and improved tolerance to Spike mutations. Interestingly  we found that B.1.1.7 infection also generates a cross-neutralizing antibody response  which  although still less potent against B.1.351  can neutralize parental wave 1 virus to a similar degree as B.1.1.7. These findings have implications for the optimization of vaccines that protect against newly emerging viral variants.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex  coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations at each cycle of genome replication. This constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its relatively large genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the past few months  the identification of new B.1.1.7  United Kingdom   B.1.351  South Africa   and P.1  Brazil  variants of concern  VOC  has highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that impact transmissibility  virulence  and immune and neutralizing antibody escape. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory over time of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to April 2021. The goal of the study was to identify which genetic modifications are the most frequent and study the dynamics of their propagation  their incorporation into the consensus sequence  and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variants for its binding to the host receptor ACE2. This study offers an integrative view of the emergence  disappearance  and consensus sequence integration of successful mutations that constitute new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their impact on neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccines.

The accelerated growth in the approved COVID-19 vaccines has sparked concerns about their efficacies which have been assessed by many studies. This systematic review compares the efficacy and effectiveness of seven COVID-19 vaccines. A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using several databases to identify studies reporting the effectiveness or the efficacy of the vaccines. Only 42 studies met our inclusion criteria  which revealed that the COVID-19 vaccines have successfully reduced the rates of infections  severity  hospitalization  and mortality among the different populations. The full-dose regimen of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is the most effective against infections with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Despite of the high effectiveness of some of the COVID-19 vaccines  more efforts are required to test their effectiveness against the other newly emerging variants.

Here we describe 203 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences analyzed from strains circulating in Rwanda from May 2020 to February 2021. In particular  we report a shift in variant distribution towards the emerging sub-lineage A.23.1 that is currently dominating. Furthermore  we report the detection of the first Rwandan cases of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern among incoming travelers tested at Kigali International Airport. To assess the importance of viral introductions from neighboring countries and local transmission  we exploit available individual travel history metadata to inform spatio-temporal phylogeographic inference  enabling us to take into account infections from unsampled locations. We uncover an important role of neighboring countries in seeding introductions into Rwanda  including those from which no genomic sequences were available. Our results highlight the importance of systematic genomic surveillance and regional collaborations for a durable response towards combating COVID-19.

Focusing on the T cell response  we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses  using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains  both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals  the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells  while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees  with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants  confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose  and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.

Here  we demonstrate the neutralization of SARS-CoV  bat CoVs WIV-1 and RsSHC014  and SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G  B.1.1.7  B.1.429  B1.351 by a receptor-binding domain  RBD -specific antibody DH1047. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with DH1047 demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV  WIV-1  RsSHC014  and SARS-CoV-2 B1.351infection in mice. Binding and structural analysis showed high affinity binding of DH1047 to an epitope that is highly conserved among Sarbecoviruses. We conclude that DH1047 is a broadly neutralizing and protective antibody that can prevent infection and mitigate outbreaks caused by SARS-like strains and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results argue that the RBD conserved epitope bound by DH1047 is a rational target for pan Group 2B coronavirus vaccines.

Current approaches to detect B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. Since many countries lack genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7  we used allele-specific PCR  and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop an RT-qPCR test that accurately and rapidly differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing and conducted a country-wide surveillance study of B.1.1.7 prevalence in Slovakia. Our multiplexed RT-qPCR test showed 97% clinical sensitivity and retesting 6 886 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples obtained during three campaigns performed within one month  revealed pervasive spread of B.1.1.7 with an average prevalence of 82%. Labs can easily implement this test to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and it is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the ΔH69 ΔV70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.

In France  most cases were due to spike D641G-harbouring viruses that descended initially from the Wuhan strain  then by the variant of B.1.160 lineage we called Marseille-4 since the summer of 2020  which was followed by the Alpha and Beta variants in early 2021  then the Delta variant currently. Methods: We determined the neutralising antibody  nAb  titres in sera from convalescent individuals previously infected by these four major local variants and from vaccine recipients to the original Wuhan strain and nine variants  including two recent circulating Delta isolates. Results: The results show high inter-individual heterogeneity in nAbs  especially according to the variant tested. The major variations among nAbs are based on the genotype responsible for the infection. Patients previously infected with the beta and B.1.160 variants had the lowest nAb titres. We show that this heterogeneity is well explained by spike protein mutants modelling using in silico approaches. The highest titres were observed in individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine  even against the delta variant. Conclusions: Immunity acquired naturally after infection is highly dependent on the infecting variant  and  unexpectedly  mRNA-based vaccine efficacy was shown to be often better than natural immunity in eliciting neutralising antibodies.

Accordingly  temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2  the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor binding domain  RBD  of the Spike glycoprotein is known to bind to its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  to initiate viral fusion. Using biochemical  biophysical and functional assays to dissect the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction  we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures  resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike glycoprotein with the ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly  the RBD N501Y mutation  present in emerging variants of concern  VOCs  that are fueling the pandemic worldwide  including the B.1.1.7  α  lineage   bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates  a hypothesis that remains to be tested.

A total of 734 samples from COVID-19 confirmed cases in Hiroshima were screened for the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2  B.1.617.1  C.37  B.1.1.529  etc. . The targeted spike region is amplified by nested RT-PCR using in-house designed primer set hCoV-Spike-A and standard amplification protocol. Additionally  randomly selected 96 samples were also amplified using primer sets hCoV-Spike-B and hCoV-Spike-C. The negative amplified samples were repeated for second attempt of amplification by volume-up protocol. Thereafter  the amplified products were assigned for Sanger sequencing using corresponding primers. The positive amplification rate of primer set hCoV-Spike-A  hCoV-Spike-B and hCoV-Spike-C were 87.3%  83.3% and 93.8% respectively for standard protocol and increased to 99.6%  95.8% and 96.9% after second attempt by volume-up protocol. The readiness of genome sequences was 96.9%  100% and 100% respectively. Among 48 mutant isolates  26 were B.1.1.7  Alpha   7 were E484K single mutation and the rest were other types of mutation. Moreover  5 cluster cases with single mutation at N501S were firstly reported in Hiroshima. This study indicates the reliability and effectiveness of Sanger sequencing to screen large number of samples for the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants. Compared to the Next Generation Sequencing  NGS   our method introduces the feasible  universally applicable  and practically useful tool for identification of the emerging variants with less expensive and time consuming especially in those countries where the NGS is not practically available. Our method allows not only to identify the pre-existing variants but also to examine other rare type of mutation or newly emerged variants and is crucial for prevention and control of pandemic.

Nevertheless  the dissemination and molecular epidemiology of the Lambda VOI in Brazil is unknown apart from a single case report. In this respect  we characterized the circulation of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Lambda VOI  C37 GR 452Q.V1 21G  in Sao Paulo State  Brazil. From March to June 2021  we identified seven Lambda isolates in a set of approximately 8000 newly sequenced genomes of the Network for Pandemic Alert of Emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 variants from Sao Paulo State. Interestingly  in three of the positive patients  the Lambda VOI infection was probably related to a contact transmission. These individuals were fully vaccinated to COVID‐19 and presented mild symptoms. The remaining positive for Lambda VOI individuals showed different levels of COVID‐19 symptoms and one of them needed hospitalization  score 5  WHO . In our study  we present a low level of Lambda VOI circulation in the Sao Paulo State. This reinforces the essential role of molecular surveillance for the effective SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic response  especially in regard to circulating variants.

Serum samples from 30 patients of younger  26 to 39 years  and older  69 to 83 years  age groups and with varying clinical severities ranging from outpatient to mechanically ventilated were collected and used to probe a novel multi-coronavirus protein microarray. This microarray contained variable-length overlapping fragments of SARS-CoV-2 spike  S   envelope  E   membrane  M   nucleocapsid  N   and open reading frame  ORF  proteins created through in vitro transcription and translation  IVTT . The array also contained SARS-CoV  Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  MERS-CoV   human coronavirus OC43  HCoV-OC43   and HCoV-NL63 proteins. IgG antibody responses to specific epitopes within the S1 protein region spanning amino acids  aa  500 to 650 and within the N protein region spanning aa 201 to 300 were found to be significantly higher in older patients and further significantly elevated in those older patients who were ventilated. Additionally  there was a noticeable overlap between antigenic regions and known mutation locations in selected emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of current clinical consequence  B.1.1.7  B1.351  P.1  CAL20.C  and B.1.526 . Moreover  the older age group displayed more consistent correlations of antibody reactivity with systemic cytokine and chemokine responses than the younger adult group. A subset of patients  however  had little or no response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and disproportionately severe clinical outcomes. Further characterization of these slow-low-responding individuals with cytokine analysis revealed significantly higher interleukin-10  IL-10   IL-15  and interferon gamma-induced protein 10  IP-10  levels and lower epidermal growth factor  EGF  and soluble CD40 ligand  sCD40L  levels than those of seroreactive patients in the cohort.

In-person registration for the event began on November 18  2021. The venue was equipped with high efficiency particulate air  HEPA  filtration  and attendees were required to wear a mask indoors and have documented receipt of at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.* On December 2  2021  the Minnesota Department of Health reported the first case of community-acquired COVID-19 in the United States caused by the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529  Omicron  variant in a person who had attended the event  1 . CDC collaborated with state and local health departments to assess event-associated COVID-19 cases and potential exposures among U.S.-based attendees using data from COVID-19 surveillance systems and an anonymous online attendee survey. Among 34 541 attendees with available contact information  surveillance data identified test results for 4 560  including 119  2.6%  persons from 16 jurisdictions with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Most  4 041 [95.2%]   survey respondents reported always wearing a mask while indoors at the event. Compared with test-negative respondents  test-positive respondents were more likely to report attending bars  karaoke  or nightclubs  and eating or drinking indoors near others for at least 15 minutes. Among 4 560 attendees who received testing  evidence of widespread transmission during the event was not identified. Genomic sequencing of 20 specimens identified the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  AY.25 and AY.103 sublineages  in 15  75%  cases  and the Omicron variant  BA.1 sublineage  in five  25%  cases. These findings reinforce the importance of implementing multiple  simultaneous prevention measures  such as ensuring up-to-date vaccination  mask use  physical distancing  and improved ventilation in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission  during large  indoor events.†.

We analyzed the potential relationships between COVID-19 vaccine coverage in different countries of the European Economic Area and rates of infection  hospitalizations  admissions to intensive care units  ICU   and deaths during the autumn 2021 SARS-CoV-2 wave  September−December . Significant negative correlations between infection rates and the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals were found during September  October  and November  but not December. The loss of this protective effect in December is likely due to the emergence of the omicron  B.1.1.529  variant  better adapted to evade vaccine-induced humoral immunity. For every considered month  the negative linear associations between the vaccine coverage and mean number of hospitalizations  r= −0.61 to −0.88   the mean number of ICU admissions  r= −0.62 to −0.81   and death rate  r= −0.64 to −0.84  were observed. The results highlight that vaccines provided significant benefits during autumn 2021. The vaccination of unvaccinated individuals should remain the primary strategy to decrease the hospital overloads  severe consequences of COVID-19  and deaths.

Here  we assessed ACE2 binding and antigenicity of Mu  B.1.621  and A.2.5 Spikes. Both these variants carry some mutations shared by other emerging variants. Some of the pivotal mutations such as N501Y and E484K in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  detected in B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta  and P.1  Gamma  are now present within the Mu variant. Similarly  the L452R mutation of B.1.617.2  Delta  variant is present in A.2.5. In this study  we observed that these Spike variants bound better to the ACE2 receptor in a temperature-dependent manner. Pseudoviral particles bearing the Spike of Mu were similarly neutralized by plasma from vaccinated individuals than those carrying the Beta  B.1.351  and Delta  B.1.617.2  Spikes. Altogether  our results indicate the importance of measuring critical parameters such as ACE2 interaction  plasma recognition and neutralization ability of each emerging variant.

The Fc moiety is designed to enhance immunogenicity by increasing uptake via Fc-receptors  FcγR  on Ag-presenting cells  APCs  and prolonging exposure due to neonatal Fc receptor  FcRn  recycling. AKS-452 induced approximately 20-fold greater neutralizing IgG titers in mice relative to those induced by SP RBD without the Fc moiety and induced comparable long-term neutralizing titers with a single dose vs. two doses. To further enhance immunogenicity  AKS-452 was evaluated in formulations containing a panel of adjuvants in which the water-in-oil adjuvant  Montanide™ ISA 720  enhanced neutralizing IgG titers by approximately 7-fold after one and two doses in mice  including the neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VERO-E6 cells. Furthermore  ISA 720-adjuvanted AKS-452 was immunogenic in rabbits and non-human primates  NHPs  and protected from infection and clinical symptoms with live SARS-CoV-2 virus in NHPs  USA-WA1 2020 viral strain  and the K18 human ACE2-trangenic  K18-huACE2-Tg  mouse  South African B.1.351 viral variant . These preclinical studies support the initiation of Phase I clinical studies with adjuvanted AKS-452 with the expectation that this room-temperature stable  Fc-fusion subunit vaccine can be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured to provide billions of doses per year especially in regions where the cold-chain is difficult to maintain.

Here it is shown that a very simple evolutionary model can fit the observed change in frequency of B.1.1.7 for several countries  regions of countries and the whole world with a single parameter  its relative fitness f  which is almost universal f ≈ 1.5. This is consistent with a 50% higher transmissibility than the local wild type and with the fact that the period in which this variant takes over has been in all the studied cases around 22 weeks.

METHODS: Seventy-eight residents and 106 staff members  naïve or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2  were recruited in NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30µg BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies  Ab  to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain  RBD   spike domains S1 and S2  RBD Ab avidity  and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 were assessed at days 0  21  28  and 49. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 naïve residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naïve staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all spike domains  lower avidity of RBD IgG  and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naïve resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. In contrast  SARS-CoV-2 infected residents had high responses to mRNA vaccination  with Ab levels comparable to infected staff. Cluster analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included naïve residents but also naïve staff  emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naïve residents and in some naïve staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection  especially with variants of concern. These data support the administration of a third dose of mRNA vaccine to further improve protection of NH residents against COVID-19.

However  the neutralization potency of two antibodies  1–57 and 2–7  which target the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the spike  was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here  we report cryo-EM structures of 1–57 and 2–7 in complex with spike  revealing each of these antibodies to utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably  each antibody represented an immune response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes. Moreover  many epitope residues recognized by 1–57 and 2–7 were outside hotspots of evolutionary pressure for ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the therapeutic use of antibodies  such as 1–57 and 2–7  which target less prevalent epitopes  could ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.

RFN vaccination of macaques using a two-dose regimen resulted in robust  predominantly Th1 CD4+ T cell responses and reciprocal peak mean serum neutralizing antibody titers of 14 000 to 21 000. Rapid control of viral replication was achieved in the upper and lower airways of animals after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge  with undetectable replication within 4 d in seven of eight animals receiving 50 µg of RFN. Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 decreased only approximately twofold relative to WA1 2020. In addition  neutralizing  effector antibody and cellular responses targeted the heterotypic SARS-CoV-1  highlighting the broad immunogenicity of RFN-ALFQ for SARS-CoV−like Sarbecovirus vaccine development.

Small-molecule antivirals like remdesivir  RDV  and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2  the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . It is not known whether combination RDV mAb will improve outcomes over single-agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. Here  we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials  C144 and C135  have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 h after infection and have therapeutic efficacy in vivo against the B.1.351 variant of concern  VOC . Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared with single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The massive emergence of L452R variants was first linked to lineage B.1.427 B.1.429  clade 21C  that has been spreading in California since November and December 2020  originally named CAL.20C and currently variant of interest epsilon. By PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of a 541-base fragment coding for amino acids 414 to 583 of the RBD from a collection of clinical specimens  we identified a separate L452R variant that also recently emerged in California but derives from the lineage B.1.232  clade 20A  named CAL.20A . Notably  CAL.20A caused an infection in gorillas in the San Diego Zoo  reported in January 2021. Unlike the epsilon variant that carries two additional mutations in the N-terminal domain of spike protein  L452R is the only mutation found in the spike proteins of CAL.20A. Based on genome-wide phylogenetic analysis  emergence of both viral variants was specifically triggered by acquisition of L452R  suggesting a strong positive selection for this mutation. Global analysis revealed that L452R is nearly omnipresent in a dozen independently emerged lineages  including the most recent variants of concern interest delta  kappa  epsilon and iota  with the lambda variant carrying L452Q. L452 is in immediate proximity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  interaction interface of RBD. It was reported that the L452R mutation is associated with immune escape and could result in a stronger cell attachment of the virus  with both factors likely increasing viral transmissibility  infectivity  and pathogenicity.

RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies  and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD  N-terminal domain  NTD  and S2 subunits of Spike. To understand how these mutations affect Spike antigenicity  we isolated and characterized >100 monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes on RBD  NTD  and S2 from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Approximately 45% showed neutralizing activity  of which ∼20% were NTD specific. NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus  whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.

We defined six different geographical regions with particular dynamics of lineage circulation. The Northeast and Northwest regions were the ones that exhibited the highest lineage diversity  while the Central south and South Southeast regions presented less diversity with predominance of a certain lineage. Additionally  by late February 2021  lineage B.1.1.519 represented more than 89% of all circulating lineages in the country.

In two naturally infected mink farms  A and B  located in Greece  we investigated the outbreaks and assessed parameters associated with virus transmission  immunity  pathology  and environmental contamination. Symptoms ranged from anorexia and mild depression to respiratory signs of varying intensity. Although the farms were at different breeding stages  mortality was similarly high  8.4% and 10.0% . The viral strains belonged to lineages B.1.1.218 and B.1.1.305  possessing the mink-specific S-Y453F substitution. Lung histopathology identified necrosis of smooth muscle and connective tissue elements of vascular walls  and vasculitis as the main early key events of the acute SARS-CoV-2-induced broncho-interstitial pneumonia. Molecular investigation in two dead minks indicated a consistently higher  0.3–1.3 log 10  RNA copies g  viral load in organs of the male mink compared to the female. In farm A  the infected farmers were responsible for the significant initial infection of 229 out of 1 000 handled minks  suggesting a very efficient human-to-mink transmission. Subsequent infections across the sheds wherein animals were being housed occurred due to airborne transmission. Based on a R 0  of 2.90 and a growth rate equal to 0.293  the generation time was estimated to be 3.6 days  indicative of the massive SARS-CoV-2 dispersal among minks. After the end of the outbreaks  a similar percentage of animals were immune in the two farms  93.0% and 93.3%   preventing further virus transmission whereas  viral RNA was detected in samples collected from shed surfaces and air. Consequently  strict biosecurity is imperative during the occurrence of clinical signs. Environmental viral load monitoring  in conjunction with NGS should be adopted in mink farm surveillance. The minimum proportion of minks that need to be immunized to avoid outbreaks in farms was calculated at 65.5%  which is important for future vaccination campaigns.

Methods : Plasma and oropharyngeal swabs samples were collected from 304 healthy adult individuals  randomly recruited in May 2021 before vaccine introduction in the area. In addition  82 plasma samples from the same area in 2019 were included as controls for cross-reaction investigation against other Coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected by qRT-PCR and sequenced using Next-Generation Sequencing. ELISA method was used for detecting IgG  IgM and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Results : About 4.9%  15 304  of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive and B.1.631 was the only variant identified. Of 109 individuals harboring anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and or IgM Ab  45.9 %  50 109  had anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Ab. A proportion of 3.7%  3 82  of control samples collected before the pandemic were positive to IgG  but negative for neutralizing Ab. Conclusions : While seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 represented 25% in indigenous population  almost 50% of seropositive participants had neutralizing antibodies. This finding highlights that the spread of the SARS-COV2 infection is under-estimate in the country.

METHODS: In a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11-May 5  2021  we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine  Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna  between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1212 participants  including 593 cases and 619 controls  median age was 58 years  22.8% were Black  13.9% were Hispanic  and 21.0% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7  Alpha  was the most common variant  67.9% of viruses with lineage determined . Full vaccination  receipt of two vaccine doses ≥14 days before illness onset  had been received by 8.2% of cases and 36.4% of controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 87.1%  95% CI: 80.7 to 91.3% . Vaccine effectiveness was similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines  and highest in adults aged 18-49 years  97.4%; 95% CI: 79.3 to 99.7% . Among 45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations  44  97.8%  were ≥50 years old and 20  44.4%  had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among patients with immunosuppression  62.9%; 95% CI: 20.8 to 82.6%  than without immunosuppression  91.3%; 95% CI: 85.6 to 94.8% . CONCLUSION: During March–May 2021  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were highly effective for preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations among US adults. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was beneficial for patients with immunosuppression  but effectiveness was lower in the immunosuppressed population.

To delineate the genomic diversity in association with geographic dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages  we collected 939 591 complete S protein sequences deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data  GISAID  from December 2019 to April 2021. An exponential emergence of S protein variants was observed since October 2020 when the four major variants of concern  VOCs   namely  alpha  α   B.1.1.7   beta  β   B.1.351   gamma  γ   P.1   and delta  δ   B.1.617   started to circulate in various communities. We found that residues 452  477  484  and 501  the 4 key amino acids located in the hACE2 binding domain of S protein  were under positive selection. Through in silico protein structure prediction and immunoinformatics tools  we discovered D614G is the key determinant to S protein conformational change  while variations of N439K  T478I  E484K  and N501Y in S1-RBD also had an impact on S protein binding affinity to hACE2 and antigenicity. Finally  we predicted that the yet-to-be-identified hypothetical N439S  T478S  and N501K mutations could confer an even greater binding affinity to hACE2 and evade host immune surveillance more efficiently than the respective native variants. This study documented the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 S protein over the first 16 months of the pandemic and identified several key amino acid changes that are predicted to confer a substantial impact on transmission and immunological recognition. These findings convey crucial information to sequence-based surveillance programs and the design of next-generation vaccines.

Here we analysed the memory B cells of five naive and five convalescent people vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to investigate the nature of the B cell and antibody response at the single-cell level. Almost 6 000 cells were sorted  over 3 000 cells produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and more than 400 cells neutralized the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in Wuhan  China. The B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.1.248  Gamma  variants escaped almost 70% of these antibodies  while a much smaller portion was impacted by the B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.617.2  Delta  variants. The overall loss of neutralization was always significantly higher in the antibodies from naive people. In part  this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline  which was found only in people who were convalescent and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggest that people who are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Experimental assessments of replication and transmission of major VOCs and progenitors are needed to understand the mechanisms of replication and transmission of VOCs 3 . Here we show that the spike protein  S  from Alpha  also known as B.1.1.7  and Beta  B.1.351  VOCs had a greater affinity towards the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor than that of the progenitor variant S D614G  in vitro. Progenitor variant virus expressing S D614G   wt-S 614G   and the Alpha variant showed similar replication kinetics in human nasal airway epithelial cultures  whereas the Beta variant was outcompeted by both. In vivo  competition experiments showed a clear fitness advantage of Alpha over wt-S 614G  in ferrets and two mouse models—the substitutions in S were major drivers of the fitness advantage. In hamsters  which support high viral replication levels  Alpha and wt-S 614G  showed similar fitness. By contrast  Beta was outcompeted by Alpha and wt-S 614G  in hamsters and in mice expressing human ACE2. Our study highlights the importance of using multiple models to characterize fitness of VOCs and demonstrates that Alpha is adapted for replication in the upper respiratory tract and shows enhanced transmission in vivo in restrictive models  whereas Beta does not overcome Alpha or wt-S 614G  in naive animals.

METHODS: We analyzed 2018 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens collected between February 9 and March 22  2021 using the Thermofisher® TaqPath TM  COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR kit  TaqPath  and the ID solutions® ID™ SARS-CoV-2 UK SA Variant Triplex RT-PCR  ID triplex  assay to screen for VOCs. RESULTS: The ID triplex assay identified 62.8% of them as VOCs: 61.8% B.1.1.7 and 0.9% B.1.351 P.1. The agreement between the ID triplex results for B.1.1.7 and the TaqPath S gene target failure  SGTF   S gene target late detection  SGTL  profile for this variant agreed very well  k=0.86 . A low virus load was the main cause of discrepancies. Sequencing discordant results with both assays indicated that the TaqPath assay detected the B.1.1.7 lineage slightly better. Both assays suggested that the virus loads of B.1.1.7 variants were significantly higher than those of non-B.1.1.7 strains. Only 10 20 B.1.351 P.1 strains detected with the ID triplex assay were confirmed by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the SGTF SGTL profiles identified using the TaqPath assay and ID triplex results are suitable for detecting the B.1.1.7 lineage. The ID triplex assay  which rapidly determines all three current VOCs simultaneously  could be a valuable tool for limiting virus spread by supporting contact-tracing and isolation.

Determining the fundamental biology of viral variants and understanding their evolutionary trajectories will guide current mitigation measures  future genetic surveillance and vaccination strategies. Here we examine virus entry by the B.1.1.7 lineage  commonly referred to as the UK Kent variant. Pseudovirus infection of model cell lines demonstrate that B.1.1.7 entry is enhanced relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain  particularly under low expression of receptor ACE2. Moreover  the entry characteristics of B.1.1.7 were distinct from that of its predecessor strain containing the D614G mutation. These data suggest evolutionary tuning of spike protein function. Additionally  we found that amino acid deletions within the N-terminal domain  NTD  of spike were important for efficient entry by B.1.1.7. The NTD is a hotspot of diversity across sarbecoviruses  therefore  we further investigated this region by examining the entry of closely related CoVs. Surprisingly  Pangolin CoV spike entry was 50–100 fold enhanced relative to SARS-CoV-2; suggesting there may be evolutionary pathways by which SARSCoV-2 may further optimise entry. Swapping the NTD between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that changes in this region alone have the capacity to enhance virus entry. Thus  the NTD plays a hitherto unrecognised role in modulating spike activity  warranting further investigation and surveillance of NTD mutations.

Recently  we identified high‐affinity neutralizing nanobodies  Nbs  specific for the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of SARS‐CoV‐2. Taking advantage of detailed epitope mapping  we generate two biparatopic Nbs  bipNbs  targeting a conserved epitope outside and two different epitopes inside the RBD:ACE2 interface. Both bipNbs bind all currently circulating VOCs with high affinities and are capable to neutralize cellular infection with VOC B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.617.2  Delta  in vitro. To assess if the bipNbs NM1267 and NM1268 confer protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in vivo  human ACE2 transgenic mice are treated intranasally before infection with a lethal dose of SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1  B.1.351  Beta  or B.1.617.2  Delta . Nb‐treated mice show significantly reduced disease progression and increased survival rates. Histopathological analyses further reveal a drastically reduced viral load and inflammatory response in lungs. These data suggest that both bipNbs are broadly active against a variety of emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 VOCs and represent easily applicable drug candidates.

Here  we examined longitudinal antibody responses and viral neutralizing capacity to the B.1 lineage virus  Wuhan related   to variants of concern  VOC; Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta   and to a local variant of interest  VOI; Lambda  in volunteers receiving the Sputnik V vaccine in Argentina. Longitudinal serum samples  N = 536  collected from 118 volunteers obtained between January and October 2021 were used. The analysis indicates that while anti-spike IgG levels significantly wane over time  the neutralizing capacity for the Wuhan-related lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and VOC is maintained within 6 months of vaccination. In addition  an improved antibody cross-neutralizing ability for circulating variants of concern  Beta and Gamma  was observed over time postvaccination. The viral variants that displayed higher escape to neutralizing antibodies with respect to the original virus  Beta and Gamma variants  were the ones showing the largest increase in susceptibility to neutralization over time after vaccination. Our observations indicate that serum neutralizing antibodies are maintained for at least 6 months and show a reduction of VOC escape to neutralizing antibodies over time after vaccination.

Omicron  B.1.1.529   the latest variant of concern  VOC   has so far shown exceptional spread and infectivity and has established itself as the dominant variant in recent months. The SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein is a key component for the recognition and binding to host cell angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 receptors. The Omicron variant harbors a cluster of substitutions deletions insertions  and more than 30 mutations are located in spike. Some noticeable mutations  including K417N  T478K  N501Y  and P681H  are shared with the previous VOCs Alpha  Beta  Gamma  or Delta variants and have been proven to be associated with higher transmissibility  viral infectivity  and immune evasion potential. Studies have revealed that the Omicron variant is partially resistant to the neutralizing activity of therapeutic antibodies and convalescent sera  which poses significant challenges for the clinical effectiveness of the current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. We provide a comprehensive analysis and summary of the epidemiology and immune escape mechanisms of the Omicron variant. We also suggest some therapeutic strategies against the Omicron variant. This review  therefore  aims to provide information for further research efforts to prevent and contain the impact of new VOCs during the ongoing pandemic.

The outbreaks occurred in rapid chronological succession  in neighborhoods with a very similar sociodemographic structure  thus allowing for cross-comparison of these events. We combined classical and molecular epidemiologic investigation methods to study infection entry  spread within the facilities  and subsequent transmission of infections to households. Epidemiologic and molecular evidence suggests a superspreading event with a non-variant of concern  non-VOC  SARS CoV-2 strain at the root of the first outbreak. The second outbreak involved two childcare facilities experiencing infection activity with the variant of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  Alpha . We show that the index cases in all outbreaks had been childcare workers  and that children contributed substantially to secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from childcare facilities to households. The frequency of secondary transmissions in households originating from B.1.1.7-infected children was increased compared to children with non-VOC infections. Self-reported symptoms  particularly cough and rhinitis  occurred more frequently in B.1.1.7-infected children. Especially in light of the rapidly spreading VOC B.1.617.2  Delta   our data underline the notion that rigorous SARS-CoV-2 testing in combination with screening of contacts regardless of symptoms is an important measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of unvaccinated individuals in daycare centers and associated households.

The appearance of new variants causes concern because of the possibility that they may evade the protection generated by vaccination campaigns  their greater capacity to be transmitted  or their higher virulence. We analyzed the circulating variants in Peru after improving our Genomic Surveillance program. The results indicate a steep increase of the lambda lineage  C.37  until becoming predominant between January and April 2021  despite the cocirculation of other variants of concern or interest. Lambda lineage deserves close monitoring and could probably become a variant of concern in the near future.

During June 2021-January 2022  CDC expanded genomic surveillance data sources to incorporate sequence data from public repositories to produce weighted estimates of variant proportions at the jurisdiction level and refined analytic methods to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of national and regional variant proportion estimates. These changes also allowed for more comprehensive variant proportion estimation at the jurisdictional level  i.e.  U.S. state  district  territory  and freely associated state . The data in this report are a summary of findings of recent proportions of circulating variants that are updated weekly on CDC's COVID Data Tracker website to enable timely public health action. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta  B.1.617.2 and AY sublineages  variant rose from 1% to >50% of viral lineages circulating nationally during 8 weeks  from May 1-June 26  2021. Delta-associated infections remained predominant until being rapidly overtaken by infections associated with the Omicron  B.1.1.529 and BA sublineages  variant in December 2021  when Omicron increased from 1% to >50% of circulating viral lineages during a 2-week period. As of the week ending January 22  2022  Omicron was estimated to account for 99.2%  95% CI = 99.0%-99.5%  of SARS-CoV-2 infections nationwide  and Delta for 0.7%  95% CI = 0.5%-1.0% . The dynamic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2021  including Delta- and Omicron-driven resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the United States  underscores the importance of robust genomic surveillance efforts to inform public health planning and practice.

Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example  the B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation  N501Y  in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations  K417N  K417T  N501Y  E484K  and S477N  and two common ACE2 mutations  S19P and K26R  on the RBD ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Gamma  P1  variants. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N T  which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies  our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding  the K417N T mutations facilitate immune escape  and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape.

We reported the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.519 in Mexico City. We reported the effective reproduction number  Rt  of B.1.1.519 and presented evidence of its geographical origin based on phylogenetic analysis. We also studied its evolution via haplotype analysis and identified the most recurrent haplotypes. Finally  we studied the clinical impact of B.1.1.519. The B.1.1.519 variant was predominant between November 2020 and May 2021  reaching 90% of all cases sequenced in February 2021. It is characterized by three amino acid changes in the spike protein: T478K  P681H  and T732A. Its Rt varies between 0.5 and 2.9. Its geographical origin remain to be investigated. Patients infected with variant B.1.1.519 showed a highly significant adjusted odds ratio  aOR  increase of 1.85 over non-B.1.1.519 patients for developing a severe critical outcome  p = 0.000296  1.33–2.6 95% CI  and a 2.35-fold increase for hospitalization  p = 0.005  1.32–4.34 95% CI .

Using a pool of pre-structured random DNA sequences  we obtained over 100 candidate aptamers after 13 cycles of enrichment under progressively more stringent selection pressure. The top 10 sequences all exhibited strong binding to the S1 protein. Two aptamers  named MSA1  K d  = 1.8 nM  and MSA5  K d  = 2.7 nM   were assessed for binding to the heat-treated S1 protein  untreated S1 protein spiked into 50% human saliva and the trimeric spike protein of both the wildtype and the B.1.1.7 variant  demonstrating comparable affinities in all cases. MSA1 and MSA5 also recognized the pseudotyped lentivirus of SARS-CoV-2 with respective K d  values of 22.7 pM and 11.8 pM. Secondary structure prediction and sequence truncation experiments revealed that both MSA1 and MSA5 adopted a hairpin structure  which was the motif pre-designed into the original library. A colorimetric sandwich assay was developed using MSA1 as both the recognition element and detection element  which was capable of detecting the pseudotyped lentivirus in 50% saliva with a limit of detection of 400 fM  confirming the potential of these aptamers as diagnostic tools for COVID-19 detection.

Using a combination of data from routine surveillance  genomic sequencing and international travel we track the international dispersal of lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  variant 501Y-V2 . We account for potential biases in genomic surveillance efforts by including passenger volumes from location of where the lineage was first reported  London and South Africa respectively. Using the software tool grinch  global report investigating novel coronavirus haplotypes   we track the international spread of lineages of concern with automated daily reports  Further  we have built a custom tracking website  cov-lineages.org global_report.html  which hosts this daily report and will continue to include novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages of concern as they are detected.

In the UK  scientists were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike  S  target using a three-target RT-PCR assay  TaqPath kit . METHODS: To control and study the current coronavirus pandemic  it is important to develop a rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work  we designed primer sets specific to the VOC  202012 01  to be used by SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion mutations Δ69 Δ70 in the spike and the Δ106 Δ107 Δ108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20 samples from positive patients  detected by using the Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Waltham  USA  that included the ORF1ab  S  and N gene targets. 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile  negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets  and four samples with S  N and ORF1ab positive profile. RESULTS: Our results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the mutations Δ69 Δ70 and Δ106 Δ107 Δ108. This protocol could be used as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in patients who were already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results for S-gene. CONCLUSIONS: This technique may allow to identify patients carrying the VOC  202012 01  or a closely related variant  in case of shortage in sequencing.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 4 . Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K  which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies  and N501Y  a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526  also known as the Iota variant 5    which contains E484K  and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals  posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York  with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics  together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage  are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526. Although SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region  its growth subsequently slowed concurrently with the rise of B.1.1.7 and ensuing variants.

Canada has amongst the longest periods between vaccine doses worldwide  despite Vancouver having the highest P.1 variant rate outside Brazil. METHODS: With surveillance data since the pandemic began  we tracked laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections  positivity rates  and vaccine uptake in all 25 558 HCWs in Vancouver Coastal Health  by occupation and subsector  and compared to the general population. Cox regression modelling adjusted for age and calendar-time calculated vaccine effectiveness  VE  against SARS-CoV-2 in fully vaccinated  ≥ 7 days post-second dose   partially vaccinated infection  after 14 days  and unvaccinated HCWs; we also compared with unvaccinated community members of the same age-range. FINDINGS: Only 3.3% of our HCWs became infected  mirroring community rates  with peak positivity of 9.1%  compared to 11.8% in the community. As vaccine coverage increased  SARS-CoV-2 infections declined significantly in HCWs  despite a surge with predominantly VOC; unvaccinated HCWs had an infection rate of 1.3 10 000 person-days compared to 0.89 for HCWs post first dose  and 0.30 for fully vaccinated HCWs. VE compared to unvaccinated HCWs was 37.2%  95% CI: 16.6–52.7%  14 days post-first dose  79.2%  CI: 64.6–87.8%  7 days post-second dose; one dose provided significant protection against infection until at least day 42. Compared with community infection rates  VE after one dose was 54.7%  CI: 44.8–62.9% ; and 84.8%  CI: 75.2–90.7%  when fully vaccinated. INTERPRETATION: Rigorous droplet-contact precautions with N95s for aerosol-generating procedures are effective in preventing occupational infection in HCWs  with one dose of mRNA vaccination further reducing infection risk despite VOC and transmissibility concerns. Delaying second doses to allow more widespread vaccination against severe disease  with strict public health  occupational health and infection control measures  has been effective in protecting the healthcare workforce.

Here  we generated 311 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected in coastal Kenya between 17 th  March and 31 st  July 2020. We estimated multiple independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the region were primarily of European origin  although introductions could have come through neighbouring countries. Lineage B.1 accounted for 74% of sequenced cases. Lineages A  B and B.4 were detected in screened individuals at the Kenya-Tanzania border or returning travellers. Though multiple lineages were introduced into coastal Kenya following the initial confirmed case  none showed extensive local expansion other than lineage B.1. International points of entry were important conduits of SARS-CoV-2 importations into coastal Kenya and early public health responses prevented established transmission of some lineages. Undetected introductions through points of entry including imports from elsewhere in the country gave rise to the local epidemic at the Kenyan coast.

In an evaluation at 21 hospitals in 18 states  the duration of mRNA vaccine  Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna  effectiveness  VE  against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was assessed among adults aged ≥18 years. Among 3 089 hospitalized adults  including 1 194 COVID-19 case-patients and 1 895 non-COVID-19 control-patients   the median age was 59 years  48.7% were female  and 21.1% had an immunocompromising condition. Overall  141  11.8%  case-patients and 988  52.1%  controls were fully vaccinated  defined as receipt of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines ≥14 days before illness onset   with a median interval of 65 days  range = 14-166 days  after receipt of second dose. VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization during the full surveillance period was 86%  95% confidence interval [CI] = 82%-88%  overall and 90%  95% CI = 87%-92%  among adults without immunocompromising conditions. VE against COVID-19- associated hospitalization was 86%  95% CI = 82%-90%  2-12 weeks and 84%  95% CI = 77%-90%  13-24 weeks from receipt of the second vaccine dose  with no significant change between these periods  p = 0.854 . Whole genome sequencing of 454 case-patient specimens found that 242  53.3%  belonged to the B.1.1.7  Alpha  lineage and 74  16.3%  to the B.1.617.2  Delta  lineage. Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was sustained over a 24-week period  including among groups at higher risk for severe COVID-19; ongoing monitoring is needed as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. To reduce their risk for hospitalization  all eligible persons should be offered COVID-19 vaccination.

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection  seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in staff and students following the full reopening of all secondary schools in England. METHODS: Public Health England  PHE  invited secondary schools in six regions  East and West London  Hertfordshire  Derbyshire  Manchester and Birmingham  to participate in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance during the 2020 21 academic year. Participants had nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning  September 2020  and end  December 2020  of the autumn term. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent risk factors for seropositivity and seroconversion. FINDINGS: Eighteen schools in six regions enrolled 2 209 participants  including 1 189  53.8%  students and 1 020  46.2%  staff. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were not significantly different between students and staff in round one  5 948; [0.53%] vs. 2 876 [0.23%]; p = 0.46  or round two  10 948 [1.05%] vs. 7 886 [0.79%]; p = 0.63   and similar to national prevalence. None of four and 7 15  47%  sequenced strains in rounds 1 and 2 were the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. In round 1  antibody seropositivity was higher in students than staff  114 893 [12.8%] vs. 79 861 [9.2%]; p = 0.016   but similar in round 2  117 893 [13.1%] vs.117 872 [13.3%]; p = 0.85   comparable to local community seroprevalence. Between the two rounds  8.7%  57 652  staff and 6.6%  36 549  students seroconverted  p = 0.16 . INTERPRETATION: In secondary schools  SARS-CoV-2 infection  seropositivity and seroconversion rates were similar in staff and students  and comparable to local community rates. Ongoing surveillance will be important for monitoring the impact of new variants in educational settings.

Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome since its identification in late 2019 has identified many sequence changes and the emergence of novel strains  each described by co-segregation of a particular set of sequence variations. Variants designated G  alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   gamma  P.1   and delta  B.1.617.2  are important lineages that emerged sequentially and are considered variants of concern. A notable feature of the last four  each of which ultimately evolved from clade G  is the large number  ≥ 20  of co-segregating sequence variations associated with them. Several variations are in the spike gene  and some variations are shared among or between strains. Meanwhile  observation of recurrent infections with the same or different SARS-CoV-2 lineages has raised concerns about the duration of the immune responses induced by the initial infection or the vaccine that was administered. While the alpha strain is sensitive to immune responses induced by earlier strains  the beta  gamma  and delta strains can escape antibody neutralization. Apart from random replication errors  intra-host RNA editing  chronic infections  and recombination are processes that may promote the accumulation of sequence changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The known contribution of recombination to coronavirus evolution and recent data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that recombination may be particularly important. Continued surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is imperative. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007 s00705-021-05295-5.

All five initial cases were associated with school settings. Through early June  Mesa County experienced a marked increase in the proportion of Delta variant cases identified through sequencing: the 7-day proportion of sequenced specimens identified as B.1.617.2 in Mesa County more than doubled  from 43% for the week ending May 1 to 88% for the week ending June 5. As of June 6  more than one half  51%  of sequenced B.1.617.2 specimens in Colorado were from Mesa County. CDPHE assessed data from surveillance  vaccination  laboratory  and hospital sources to describe the preliminary epidemiology of the Delta variant and calculate crude vaccine effectiveness  VE . Vaccination coverage in early May in Mesa County was lower  36% of eligible residents fully vaccinated  than that in the rest of the state  44% . Compared with that in all other Colorado counties  incidence  intensive care unit  ICU  admissions  and COVID-19 case fatality ratios were significantly higher in Mesa County during the analysis period  April 27-June 6  2021. In addition  during the same time period  the proportion of COVID-19 cases in persons who were fully vaccinated  vaccine breakthrough cases  was significantly higher in Mesa County compared with that in all other Colorado counties. Estimated crude VE against reported symptomatic infection for a 2-week period ending June 5 was 78%  95% confidence interval [CI] = 71%-84%  for Mesa County and 89%  95% CI = 88%-91%  for other Colorado counties. Vaccination is a critical strategy for preventing infection  serious illness  and death from COVID-19. Enhanced mitigation strategies  including masking in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status  should be considered in areas with substantial or high case rates.

In this study  African green monkeys were infected intranasally with either a contemporary D614G or the UK B.1.1.7 variant. Both variants caused mild respiratory disease with no significant differences in clinical presentation. Significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were found in upper and lower respiratory tract samples and tissues from B.1.1.7 infected animals. Interestingly  D614G infected animals showed significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus in rectal swabs and gastrointestinal tract tissues. Our results indicate that B.1.1.7 infection in African green monkeys is associated with increased respiratory replication and shedding but no disease enhancement similar to human B.1.1.7 cases.

Its impact on hospitalised patients is less well documented. METHODS: We collected viral sequences and clinical data of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 and hospital-onset COVID-19 infections  HOCIs   sampled 16 November 2020 to 10 January 2021  from eight hospitals participating in the COG-UK-HOCI study. Associations between the variant and the outcomes of all-cause mortality and intensive therapy unit  ITU  admission were evaluated using mixed effects Cox models adjusted by age  sex  comorbidities  care home residence  pregnancy and ethnicity. FINDINGS: Sequences were obtained from 2341 inpatients  HOCI cases=786  and analysis of clinical outcomes was carried out in 2147 inpatients with all data available. The HR for mortality of B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages was 1.01  95% CI 0.79 to 1.28  p=0.94  and for ITU admission was 1.01  95% CI 0.75 to 1.37  p=0.96 . Analysis of sex-specific effects of B.1.1.7 identified increased risk of mortality  HR 1.30  95% CI 0.95 to 1.78  p=0.096  and ITU admission  HR 1.82  95% CI 1.15 to 2.90  p=0.011  in females infected with the variant but not males  mortality HR 0.82  95% CI 0.61 to 1.10  p=0.177; ITU HR 0.74  95% CI 0.52 to 1.04  p=0.086 . INTERPRETATION: In common with smaller studies of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2  we did not find an overall increase in mortality or ITU admission associated with B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages. However  women with B.1.1.7 may be at an increased risk of admission to intensive care and at modestly increased risk of mortality.

Using S gene target failure  SGTF  and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing  we investigated the prevalence and dynamics of this variant in the United States  U.S.   tracking it back to its early emergence. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state  the variant increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased transmission of 40-50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020  with community transmission spreading it to most states within months. We show that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 became dominant  requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

P.1  Gamma  variant was initially identified in northern Brazil but has now spread worldwide. This is a report of a 48-year-old female resident of southern Florida with confirmed reinfection with P.1 variant 9 months following the initial infection. This patient was not immunocompromised and was not vaccinated. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old woman residing in southern Florida presented with symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with oral swab polymerase chain reaction  PCR  in September 2020. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously after 5 days. Nine months later  the patient again presented with respiratory  digestive  and constitutional symptoms. The nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive. At that time  she had not received any vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. Whole-genome sequencing  WGS  of viral RNA from the patient’s second infection confirmed that the viral strain was P.1 variant containing the E484K spike protein substitution. CONCLUSIONS: This report has identified a confirmed case of reinfection with P.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 outside Brazil. This case supports recent epidemiological findings that indicate this VOC may have increased infectivity and virulence  and highlights the importance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for everyone.

Here we show the dynamics and the mechanisms behind the rapid adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to growth in Vero E6 cells. The selective advantage for growth in Vero E6 cells is due to increased cleavage efficiency by cathepsins at the mutated S1 S2 site. S1 S2 site also constitutes a heparan sulfate  HS  binding motif that influenced virus growth in Vero E6 cells  but HS antagonist did not inhibit virus adaptation in these cells. The entry of Vero E6-adapted virus into human cells is defective because the mutated spike variants are poorly processed by furin or TMPRSS2. Minor subpopulation that lack the furin cleavage motif in the spike protein rapidly become dominant upon passaging through Vero E6 cells  but wild type sequences are maintained at low percentage in the virus swarm and mediate a rapid reverse adaptation if the virus is passaged again on TMPRSS2 +  human cells. Our data show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt itself to available proteases and argue for deep sequence surveillance to identify the emergence of novel variants. IMPORTANCE Recently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  alpha variant   B.1.617.2  delta variant   and B.1.1.529  omicron variant  harbor spike mutations and have been linked to increased virus pathogenesis. The emergence of these novel variants highlights coronavirus adaptation and evolution potential  despite the stable consensus genotype of clinical isolates. We show that subdominant variants maintained in the virus population enable the virus to rapidly adapt to selection pressure. Although these adaptations lead to genotype change  the change is not absolute and genomes with original genotype are maintained in the virus swarm. Thus  our results imply that the relative stability of SARS-CoV-2 in numerous independent clinical isolates belies its potential for rapid adaptation to new conditions.

The absence of specific biotherapeutics requires new strategies to prevent the spread and prophylaxis of the novel virus and its variants. The SARS-CoV-2 virus shows pathogenesis by entering the host cells via spike protein and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptor protein. Thus  the present study aims to compute the binding energies between a wide range of bacteriocins with receptor-binding domain  RBD  on spike proteins of wild type  WT  and beta variant  lineage B.1.351 . Molecular docking analyses were performed to evaluate binding energies. Upon achieving the best bio-peptides with the highest docking scores  further molecular dynamics  MD  simulations were performed to validate the structure and interaction stability. Protein–protein docking of the chosen 22 biopeptides with WT-RBD showed docking scores lower than −7.9 kcal mol. Pediocin PA-1 and salivaricin P showed the lowest  best  docking scores of − 12 kcal mol. Pediocin PA-1  salivaricin B  and salivaricin P showed a remarkable increase in the double mutant’s predicted binding affinity with −13.8 kcal mol  −13.0 kcal mol  and −12.5 kcal mol  respectively. Also  a better predicted binding affinity of pediocin PA-1 and salivaricin B against triple mutant was observed compared to the WT. Thus  pediocin PA-1 binds stronger to mutants of the RBD  particularly to double and triple mutants. Salivaricin B showed a better predicted binding affinity towards triple mutant compared to WT  showing that it might be another bacteriocin with potential activity against the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant. Overall  pediocin PA-1  salivaricin P  and salivaricin B are the most promising candidates for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2  including lineage B.1.351  entrance into the human cells. These bacteriocins derived from lactic acid bacteria hold promising potential for paving an alternative way for treatment and prophylaxis of WT and beta variants.

The virus that initially appeared in China later mutated several times  wreaking havoc and claiming many lives worldwide amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. After Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta variants  the most recently emerged variant of concern  VOC  is the Omicron  B.1.1.529  that has evolved due to the accumulation of high numbers of mutations especially in the spike protein  raising concerns for its ability to evade from pre-existing immunity acquired through vaccination or natural infection as well as overpowering antibodies-based therapies. Several theories are on the surface to explain how the Omicron has gathered such a high number of mutations within less time. Few of them are higher mutation rates within a subgroup of population and then its introduction to a larger population  long term persistence and evolution of the virus in immune-compromised patients  and epizootic infection in animals from humans  where under different immune pressures the virus mutated and then got reintroduced to humans. Multifaceted approach including rapid diagnosis  genome analysis of emerging variants  ramping up of vaccination drives and receiving booster doses  efficacy testing of vaccines and immunotherapies against newly emerged variants  updating the available vaccines  designing of multivalent vaccines able to generate hybrid immunity  up-gradation of medical facilities and strict implementation of adequate prevention and control measures need to be given high priority to handle the on-going SARS-CoV-2 pandemic successfully.

Tunisia has experienced several waves of COVID-19 with a significant number of infections and deaths. The present study provides genetic information on the different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 that circulated in Tunisia over 17 months. Lineages were assigned for 1359 samples using whole-genome sequencing  partial S gene sequencing and variant-specific real-time RT-PCR tests. Forty-eight different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified  including variants of concern  VOCs   variants of interest  VOIs  and variants under monitoring  VUMs   particularly Alpha  Beta  Delta  A.27  Zeta and Eta. The first wave  limited to imported and import-related cases  was characterized by a small number of positive samples and lineages. During the second wave  a large number of lineages were detected; the third wave was marked by the predominance of the Alpha VOC  and the fourth wave was characterized by the predominance of the Delta VOC. This study adds new genomic data to the global context of COVID-19  particularly from the North African region  and highlights the importance of the timely molecular characterization of circulating strains.

High-frequency testing has been proposed as a potential solution to prevent outbreaks. However  current tests are not sufficiently low-cost  rapid  or scalable to enable broad COVID-19 testing. Here  we describe LEAD  Low-cost Electrochemical Advanced Diagnostic   a diagnostic test that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  within 6.5 min and costs $1.50 per unit to produce using easily accessible and commercially available materials. LEAD is highly sensitive toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  limit of detection = 229 fg⋅mL −1   and displays an excellent performance profile using clinical saliva  100.0% sensitivity  100.0% specificity  and 100.0% accuracy  and nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal  88.7% sensitivity  86.0% specificity  and 87.4% accuracy  samples. No cross-reactivity was detected with other coronavirus or influenza strains. Importantly  LEAD also successfully diagnosed the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 UK variant. The device presents high reproducibility under all conditions tested and preserves its original sensitivity for 5 d when stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. Our low-cost and do-it-yourself technology opens new avenues to facilitate high-frequency testing and access to much-needed diagnostic tests in resource-limited settings and low-income communities.

As the pandemic has progressed  the understanding of this disease has evolved. OBJECTIVE: This first in a two-part series on COVID-19 updates provides a focused overview of the presentation and evaluation of COVID-19 for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: COVID-19  caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several variants exist  including a variant of concern known as Delta  B.1.617.2 lineage  and the Omicron variant  B.1.1.529 lineage . The Delta variant is associated with higher infectivity and poor patient outcomes  and the Omicron variant has resulted in a significant increase in infections. While over 80% of patients experience mild symptoms  a significant proportion can be critically ill  including those who are older and those with comorbidities. Upper respiratory symptoms  fever  and changes in taste smell remain the most common presenting symptoms. Extrapulmonary complications are numerous and may be severe  including the cardiovascular  neurologic  gastrointestinal  and dermatologic systems. Emergency department evaluation includes focused testing for COVID-19 and assessment of end-organ injury. Imaging may include chest radiography  computed tomography  or ultrasound. Several risk scores may assist in prognostication  including the 4C  Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium  score  quick COVID Severity Index  qCSI   NEWS2  and the PRIEST score  but these should only supplement and not replace clinical judgment. CONCLUSION: This review provides a focused update of the presentation and evaluation of COVID-19 for emergency clinicians.
doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00311,Insights into SARS-CoV-2’s Mutations for Evading Human Antibodies: Sacrifice and Survival,doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00311,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834772/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00311,pubmed:33834772,pmc:PMC8936053,J Med Chem,2021,Insights into SARS-CoV-2’s Mutations for Evading Human Antibodies: Sacrifice and Survival,[Image: see text] The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 that first emerged in South Africa with triple mutations  N501Y  K417N  and E484K  is globally worrisome. It is known that N501Y and E484K can enhance binding between the coronavirus receptor domain  RBD  and human ACE2. However  the K417N mutation appears to be unfavorable as it removes one interfacial salt bridge. Here  we show that despite the decrease in binding affinity  1.48 kcal mol  between RBD and ACE2  the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt bridge between the RBD and neutralizing antibody CB6. This substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal mol  thus facilitating the process by which the variant efficiently eludes CB6  including many other antibodies . Our theoretical predictions agree with existing experimental findings. Harnessing the revealed molecular mechanisms makes it possible to redesign therapeutic antibodies  thus making them more efficacious.

METHODS: PCR SNP assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 s-gene mutations ΔH69-V70  L452R  E484K  N501Y  H655Y  and P681R using melting curve analysis were performed on 567 samples in which SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected by a multiplex PCR. Viral whole genome sequencing  WGS  was performed to confirm the presence of SNPs and to identify the Pangolin lineage. Additionally  1133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with SGTF were further assessed by WGS to determine the presence of ΔH69-V70. RESULTS: The N501Y-specific assay  N=567  had an overall percent agreement  OPA  of 98.5%. The ΔH69-V70-  N=178  and E484K-specific  N=401  assays had an OPA of 96.6 and 99.7% respectively. Assessment of H655Y  N=139  yielded a 100.0% concordance when applied in the proposed algorithm. The L452R-  N=67  and P681R-specific  N=62  assays had an OPA of 98.2 and 98.1% respectively. The proposed algorithm identified six variants of concern interest  VOC VOI  – Alpha  N=149   Beta  N=65   Gamma  N=86   Delta  N=49   Eta  N=6   Kappa  N=6  – and 205 non-VOC VOI strains – including the variants under monitoring B.1.214.2  N=43  and B.1.1.318  N=18  and Epsilon  N=1 . An excellent concordance was observed for the identification of all SARS-CoV-2 lineages evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: We present a flexible testing algorithm for the rapid detection of current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOC VOIs which can be easily adapted based on the local endemicity of specific variants.

As of December 2021  a total of 1669 high-coverage whole-genome sequences submitted to EpiCoV GISAID database were analyzed to infer clades and mutation annotation compared with the wild-type variant Wuhan-Hu-1. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed the existence of eleven GISAID clades with GR  variant of the spike protein S-D614G and nucleocapsid protein N-G204R   GH  variant of the ORF3a coding protein ORF3a-Q57H  and GK  variant S-T478K  being the most common with 25.9%  19.9%  and 19.6%  respectively  followed by their parent clade G  variant S-D614G   10.3% . Lower prevalence was noted for GRY  variant S-N501Y   5.1%   S  variant ORF8-L84S   3.1%  and GV  variant of the ORF3a coding protein NS3-G251V   2.0% . Interestingly  1.5% of total genomes were assigned as GRA  Omicron   the newly emerged clade. Across the North African countries  108 SARS-CoV-2 lineages using the Pangolin assignment were identified  whereby most genomes fell within six major lineages and variants of concern  VOC  including B.1  the Delta variants  AY.X  B.1.617.2   C.36  B.1.1.7 and B.1.1. The effect of mutations in SAR-CoV-2 genomes highlighted similar profiles with D614G spike  S  and ORF1b-P314L variants as the most changes found in 95.3% and 87.9% of total sequences  respectively. In addition  mutations affecting other viral proteins appeared frequently including; N:RG203KR  N:G212V  NSP3:T428I  ORF3a:Q57H  S:N501Y  M:I82T and E:V5F. These findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance for understanding the SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity and its spread patterns  leading to a better guiding of public health intervention measures. The know-how analysis of the present work could be implemented worldwide in order to overcome this health crisis through harmonized approaches.

Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are now available  including mRNA-1273  which has shown 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. However  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to concerns of viral escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Several variants have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced immunity  most notably B.1.351  Beta   although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here  we present the initial evaluation in mice of 2 updated mRNA vaccines designed to target SARS-CoV-2 variants:  1  monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the spike protein found in B.1.351 and  2  mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Both vaccines were evaluated as a 2-dose primary series in mice; mRNA-1273.351 was also evaluated as a booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with mRNA-1273. The results demonstrated that a primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273.351 was effective at increasing neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.351  while mRNA-1273.211 was effective at providing broad cross-variant neutralization. A third  booster  dose of mRNA-1273.351 significantly increased both wild-type and B.1.351-specific neutralization titers. Both mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 are being evaluated in pre-clinical challenge and clinical studies.

Although several vaccines have been approved for emergency use  the emergence and rapid spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants have sparked fears of vaccine failure due to immune evasion. Massive viral genome sequencing has been recommended to track the genetic changes that could lead to adverse consequences. METHODS: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 respiratory isolates from the National Public Health Laboratory  Malaysia and examined them together with viral genomes deposited in GISAID by other Malaysian researchers  to understand the evolutionary trend of the virus circulating in the country. We studied the distribution of virus lineages and site-wise mutations  analysed genetic clustering with the goeBURST full Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm  examined the trend of viral nucleotide diversity over time and performed nucleotide substitution association analyses. RESULTS: We identified 22 sub-lineages  13 clonal complexes  178 sequence types and seven sites of linkage disequilibrium in 277 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced between January and December 2020. B.1.524 was the largest lineage group. The number of mutations per genome ranged from 0 to 19. The mean genomic diversity value over 12 months was 3.26 × 10 −4 . Of 359 mutations detected  60.5% of which were non-synonymous  the most frequent were in the ORF1ab  P4715L   S  D614G and A701V  and N  S194L  genes. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulated an abundance of mutations in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Its overall genetic diversity  however  is relatively low compared to other Asian countries with larger populations. Continuous genomic and epidemiological surveillance will help to clarify the evolutionary processes determining viral diversity and impacting on human health.
doi:10.3390/v13081491,Rise and Fall of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage A.27 in Germany,doi:10.3390/v13081491,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452356/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081491,pubmed:34452356,pmc:PMC8402818,Viruses,2021,Rise and Fall of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage A.27 in Germany,Here  we report on the increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A.27 in Germany during the first months of 2021. Genomic surveillance identified 710 A.27 genomes in Germany as of 2 May 2021  with a vast majority identified in laboratories from a single German state  Baden-Wuerttemberg  n = 572; 80.5% . Baden-Wuerttemberg is located near the border with France  from where most A.27 sequences were entered into public databases until May 2021. The first appearance of this lineage based on sequencing in a laboratory in Baden-Wuerttemberg can be dated to early January ’21. From then on  the relative abundance of A.27 increased until the end of February but has since declined—meanwhile  the abundance of B.1.1.7 increased in the region. The A.27 lineage shows a mutational pattern typical of VOIs VOCs  including an accumulation of amino acid substitutions in the Spike glycoprotein. Among those  L18F  L452R and N501Y are located in the epitope regions of the N-terminal-  NTD  or receptor binding domain  RBD  and have been suggested to result in immune escape and higher transmissibility. In addition  A.27 does not show the D614G mutation typical for all VOIs VOCs from the B lineage. Overall  A.27 should continue to be monitored nationally and internationally  even though the observed trend in Germany was initially displaced by B.1.1.7  Alpha   while now B.1.617.2  Delta  is on the rise.

A healthy man completed a graded cycling ergometer test prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection  then again after receiving an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. Using whole blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation assays  IFN-γ ELISPOT assays  flow cytometry  ex vivo viral-specific T-cell expansion assays and deep T-cell receptor  TCR  β sequencing  we found that exercise robustly mobilized highly functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells to the blood compartment that recognized spike protein  membrane protein  nucleocapsid antigen and the B.1.1.7 α-variant  and consisted mostly of CD3+ CD8+ T-cells and double-negative  CD4- CD8-  CD3+ T-cells. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell mobilization with exercise was intensity dependent and robust when compared to T-cells recognizing other viruses  e.g. CMV  EBV  influenza . Vaccination enhanced the number of exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 T-cells recognizing spike protein and the α-variant only. Exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells proliferated more vigorously to ex vivo peptide stimulation and maintained broad TCR-β diversity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens both before and after ex vivo expansion. Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transiently elevated during exercise after both infection and vaccination. Finally  infection was associated with an increased metabolic demand to defined exercise workloads  which was restored to pre-infection levels after vaccination. This case study provides impetus for larger studies to determine if these immune responses to exercise can facilitate viral clearance  ameliorate symptoms of long COVID syndrome  and or restore functional exercise capacity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Bovine lactoferrin strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro through direct entry inhibition and immunomodulatory mechanisms. This study reports on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of commercially available bLF and common dairy ingredients in the human lung cell line H1437 using a custom high-content imaging and analysis pipeline. We also show for the first time that bLF has potent efficacy across different viral strains including the South African B.1.351  UK B.1.1.7  Brazilian P.1  and Indian Delta variants. Interestingly  we show that bLF is most potent against the B.1.1.7 variant [half-maximal inhibitory concentration  IC 50   = 3.7 µg mL]  suggesting that this strain relies on entry mechanisms that are strongly inhibited by bLF. We also show that one of the major proteolysis products of bLF  lactoferricin B 17–41  has a modest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity that could add to the clinical significance of this protein for SARS-CoV-2 treatment as lactoferricin is released by pepsin during digestion. Finally  we show that custom chewable lactoferrin tablets formulated in dextrose or sorbitol have equivalent potency to unformulated samples and provide an option for future human clinical trials. Lactoferrin's broad inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 variants in conjunction with the low cost and ease of production make this an exciting clinical candidate for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 Breakthrough Infections in Dallas County  Texas  2021,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.190,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.190,,pmc:PMC8644169,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,190. Epidemiology of COVID-19 Breakthrough Infections in Dallas County  Texas  2021,BACKGROUND: From March 2020 through May 2021  Dallas County reported a total of 304 056 cases of COVID-19  including 4 073 deaths. During the month of December 2020  a post-holiday surge of cases led to peak daily average case rates of over 50 cases per 100 000. COVID-19 cases and deaths have since declined substantially following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine delivery. As of June 8  2021  about 1 831 588 Dallas County residents have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 910 067 are fully vaccinated. Recent county integration of immunization and case databases enabled identification and analysis of COVID-19 breakthrough infections. METHODS: A COVID-19 breakthrough infection was defined as a positive test  PCR or antigen  collected from an individual ≥ 14 days after receiving the full series of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Nationally  10 262 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 US states and territories  through April 2021. Vaccine breakthrough cases were reviewed and medical records abstracted to collect demographic information  clinical characteristics  and medical conditions. Data analysis was performed using R  version 4.0.2  2020 . RESULTS: Of the 700 vaccine breakthrough cases reported in Dallas County residents as of June 8  2021  304  43%  were male and 396  57%  female  with an average age of 53 years. The majority of the vaccine breakthrough cases were White  42% ; 25% were Hispanic Latino; and 20% were Black. Almost all breakthrough cases were confirmed with PCR testing  with 451  64%  cases receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Of breakthrough cases  49% were symptomatic; 52%  358  had underlying conditions including: tobacco use  obesity  or immunocompromised state; 68  10%  were hospitalized; and 11  1.6%  died. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 51 cases  with 14  27.5%  variants identified  including: eight B.1.1.7  two B.1.429 and one P.1 variants. CONCLUSION: Despite the high levels of vaccine efficacy documented in US vaccine trials  COVID-19 breakthrough infections  though currently uncommon  do occur and are important to investigate. Ongoing close public health surveillance of variants is needed to discern changes in patterns of vaccine efficacy and characteristics of populations at greatest risk of severe disease from COVID-19.

Within only three months  omicron has spread rapidly to become the dominant variant in many countries. Studies have begun to evaluate the virulence  transmissibility  and degree of immune protection from current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or previous of infection with the omicron variant. On 21 January 2022  the WHO published its seventh technical update and recommendations for priority actions in response to the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant and cautioned that the overall risk from omicron remains high. At the start of this third year of the global COVID-19 pandemic  this editorial aims to summarize the evidence that supports the current priority recommendations and response from the WHO regarding the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.1.529.

Such mutations have exhibited high mortality and severity due to the newly emerged more infectious sites of SARS‐CoV‐2  making viral infection more transmissible  infectious  and severe. Recently  SARS‐CoV‐2 mutated to another variant  namely  Omicron  B.1.1.529   which is many times more transmissible and infectious than existed deadly Delta variants of the virus. This severity is closely correlated to a larger number of mutations observed in the receptor‐binding domain of the spike protein of the Omicron‐SARS‐CoV‐2. Considering severity  Omicron has been declared as variant of concerns by the World Health Organization and within days from its emergence  Omicron infection has spread globally  increased hospitalization  exhibited more severity for the young generation  invaded defense mechanism of natural immunity  not responsive to the available vaccines. Such circumstances resonated with the efficiency of available strategies established to manage COVID‐19 intelligently and successfully.

We recently reported the protective activity of an intranasally administered spike protein-based chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine  ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S  in animals  which has advanced to human trials. Here  we assessed its durability  dose response  and cross-protective activity in mice. A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced durably high neutralizing and Fc effector antibody responses in serum and S-specific IgG and IgA secreting long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. Protection against a historical SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed across a 100-fold vaccine dose range and over a 200-day period. At 6 weeks or 9 months after vaccination  serum antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 strains with B.1.351  B.1.1.28  and B.1.617.1 spike proteins and conferred almost complete protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after challenge with variant viruses. Thus  in mice  intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides durable protection against historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Antigenic drift can potentially bring about reduced protective T cell immunity and  consequently  more severe disease manifestations. To assess this possibility  the T cell responses to the wild-type Wuhan-1 SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein and the Omicron B.1.1.529 spike protein were compared. Accordingly  peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMC  were collected from eight healthy volunteers 4–5 months following a third vaccination with BNT162b2  and stimulated with overlapping peptide libraries representing the spike of either the ancestral or the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus variants. Quantification of the specific T cells was carried out by a fluorescent ELISPOT assay  monitoring cells secreting interferon-gamma  IFNg   interleukin-10  IL-10  and interleukin-4  IL-4 . For all the examined individuals  comparable levels of reactivity to both forms of spike protein were determined. In addition  a dominant Th1 response was observed  manifested mainly by IFNg-secreting cells and only limited numbers of IL-10- and IL-4-secreting cells. The data demonstrate stable T cell activity in response to the emerging Omicron variant in the tested individuals; therefore  the protective immunity to the variant following BNT162b2 vaccination is not significantly affected.

The index case had a travel history and spent 24 days in the house before being tested and was asymptomatic. Physical overcrowding in the house provided a favourable environment for intra-cluster infection transmission. Restriction of movement of family members due to countrywide lockdown limited the spread in community. Among the infected  only four individuals developed symptoms. The complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved using next-generation sequencing from eight clinical samples which demonstrated a 99.99% similarity with reference to Wuhan strain and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a distinct cluster  lying in the B.6.6 pangolin lineage.

Data are limited  however  whether breakthrough infection during the epidemic of the variant is ascribed to insufficient vaccine-induced immunogenicity. METHODS: We described incident COVID-19 in relation to the vaccination program among workers of a referral hospital in Tokyo. During the predominantly Delta epidemic  we followed 2 415 fully vaccinated staff  BNT162b2  for breakthrough infection and selected three matched controls. We measured post-vaccination neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type  Alpha  B.1.1.7   and Delta  B.1.617.2  strains using live viruses and anti-spike antibodies using quantitative assays  and compared them using the generalized estimating equation model between the two groups. RESULTS: No COVID-19 cases occurred 1–2 months after the vaccination program during the fourth epidemic wave in Japan  dominated by the Alpha variant  while 22 cases emerged 2–4 months after the vaccination program during the fifth wave  dominated by the Delta variant. In the vaccinated cohort  all 17 cases of breakthrough infection were mild or asymptomatic and had returned to work early. There was no measurable difference between cases and controls in post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against the wild-type  Alpha  and Delta  and anti-spike antibody titers  while neutralizing titers against the variants were considerably lower than those against the wild-type. CONCLUSIONS: Post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were not decreased among patients with breakthrough infection relative to their controls under the Delta variant rampage. The result points to the importance of infection control measures in the post-vaccination era  irrespective of immunogenicity profile.

SARS-CoV-2 disease is severe in K18 transgenic mice  K18-hACE2 Tg  expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2   the SARS-CoV-2 receptor  under an ectopic cytokeratin promoter  with high levels of infection measured in the lung and brain. Here  we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 knock-in  KI  mice that express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2  mACE2 . Intranasal inoculation of hACE2 KI mice with SARS-CoV-2 WA1 2020 resulted in substantial viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts with limited spread to extrapulmonary organs. However  SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 KI mice did not lose weight and developed limited pathology. Moreover  no significant differences in viral burden were observed in hACE2 KI mice infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants compared to the WA1 2020 strain. Because the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in mice remain uncertain  we evaluated the impact of the naturally occurring  mouse-adapting N501Y mutation by comparing infection of hACE2 KI  K18-hACE2 Tg  ACE2-deficient  and wild-type C57BL 6 mice. The N501Y mutation minimally affected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 KI mice but was required for viral replication in wild-type C57BL 6 mice in a mACE2-dependent manner and augmented pathogenesis in the K18-hACE2 Tg mice. Thus  the N501Y mutation likely enhances interactions with mACE2 or hACE2 in vivo. Overall  our study highlights the hACE2 KI mice as a model of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease and clarifies the requirement of the N501Y mutation in mice. IMPORTANCE Mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis have facilitated the rapid evaluation of countermeasures. While the first generation of models developed pneumonia and severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection  they relied on ectopic expression of supraphysiological levels of human ACE2  hACE2 . This has raised issues with their relevance to humans  as the hACE2 receptor shows a more restricted expression pattern in the respiratory tract. Here  we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease with viruses containing or lacking a key mouse-adapting mutation in the spike gene in hACE2 KI mice  which express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2. While infection of hACE2 KI mice with multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern resulted in viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts  the animals did not sustain severe lung injury. Thus  hACE2 KI mice serve as a model of mild infection with both ancestral and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.

Although much effort has focused on the characterization of changes in the spike protein in variants of concern  mutations outside of spike are likely to contribute to adaptation. Here  using unbiased abundance proteomics  phosphoproteomics  RNA sequencing and viral replication assays  we show that isolates of the Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant 3  suppress innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells more effectively than first-wave isolates. We found that the Alpha variant has markedly increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of the nucleocapsid protein  N   Orf9b and Orf6—all known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70  a mitochondrial protein that is required for activation of the RNA-sensing adaptor MAVS. Moreover  the activity of Orf9b and its association with TOM70 was regulated by phosphorylation. We propose that more effective innate immune suppression  through enhanced expression of specific viral antagonist proteins  increases the likelihood of successful transmission of the Alpha variant  and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection 4 . The importance of mutations outside the spike coding region in the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is underscored by the observation that similar mutations exist in the N and Orf9b regulatory regions of the Delta and Omicron variants.

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in Esteio  Southern Brazil  using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly  the case fatality rate  CFR  in Esteio  3.26%  is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul  RS  state  2.56%  and the entire Brazil  2.74% . RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020  highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein  D614G and V1176F   an emergent mutation  E484K  in spike Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages  and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein  R203K and G204R . E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October  which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters  including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages  B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248  and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the value of correlating clinical  epidemiological and genomic information for the understanding of viral evolution and its spatial distribution over time. This is of paramount importance to better inform policy making strategies to fight COVID-19.

Among children aged 5-11 years  VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters 14-67 days after dose 2  the longest interval after dose 2 in this age group  was 46%. Among adolescents aged 12-15 and 16-17 years  VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 83% and 76%  respectively; VE ≥150 days after dose 2 was 38% and 46%  respectively. Among adolescents aged 16-17 years  VE increased to 86% ≥7 days after dose 3  booster dose . VE against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was substantially lower during the Omicron predominant period than the B.1.617.2  Delta  predominant period among adolescents aged 12-17 years  with no significant protection ≥150 days after dose 2 during Omicron predominance. However  in adolescents aged 16-17 years  VE during the Omicron predominant period increased to 81% ≥7 days after a third booster dose. During the full study period  including pre-Delta  Delta  and Omicron predominant periods  VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization among children aged 5-11 years was 74% 14-67 days after dose 2  with wide CIs that included zero. Among adolescents aged 12-15 and 16-17 years  VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 92% and 94%  respectively; VE ≥150 days after dose 2 was 73% and 88%  respectively. All eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations  including a booster dose for those aged 12-17 years.

The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates  transmissibility  and potentially mortality  1 . To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape  we conducted infection and re-infection studies in naïve and convalescent Syrian hamsters  >10 months old . Hamsters infected by either a B.1.1.7 variant or a B.1  G614  variant exhibited comparable viral loads and pathology. Convalescent hamsters that were previously infected by the original D614 variant were protected from disease following B.1.1.7 challenge with no observable clinical signs or lung pathology. Altogether  our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in hamsters and that natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant.

An observational case-control study was performed of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections in hospitalized or ambulatory patients in Monterrey  Mexico  from April through August 2021. Vaccination breakthrough was defined as a SARS-CoV-2 infection that occurred any time after 7 days of inoculation with partial  e.g.  first dose of two-dose vaccines  or complete immunization  e.g.  second dose of two-dose vaccines or single-dose vaccine  accordingly . Case group patients  n = 53  had partial or complete vaccination schemes with CanSino  45%   Sinovac  19%   Pfizer BioNTech  15%   and AstraZeneca Oxford  15% . CanSino was administered most frequently in ambulatory patients  p < 0.01 . The control group  n = 19  received no COVID-19 vaccines. Among SARS-CoV-2 variants detected by whole-genome sequencing  VOC Delta B.1.617.2 predominated in vaccinated ambulatory patients  p < 0.01  and AY.4 in hospitalized patients  p = 0.04 ; VOI Mu B.1.621 was detected in four  7.55%  vaccinated patients. SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in our hospital occurred mostly in patients vaccinated with CanSino due to the higher prevalence of CanSino vaccine administration in our population. These patients developed mild COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospitalization. The significance of this study lies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants compromising the efficacy of local immunization therapies in Monterrey  Mexico.

We present two cases of intrauterine fetal demise and one case of severe fetal distress in the setting of maternal infection with Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2. In all cases  fetal demise or distress occurred within 14 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Evaluation revealed maternal viremia  high nasopharyngeal viral load  evidence of placental infection with Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2  and hallmark features of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis. We suggest that Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy warrants vigilance for placental dysfunction and fetal compromise regardless of disease severity.

The first driven by lineage P.2  in late 2020  and the second by lineage Gamma  in early 2021. To understand how these SARS-CoV-2 lineages spread in Brazil  we analyzed 11 724 genomes collected throughout the country between September 2020 and April 2021. Our findings indicate that lineage P.2 probably emerged in July 2020 in the Rio de Janeiro state and Gamma in November 2020 in the Amazonas state. Both states were the main hubs of viral disseminations to other Brazilian locations. We estimate that Gamma was 1.56-3.06 times more transmissible than P.2 in Rio de Janeiro and that the median effective reproductive number  Re  of Gamma varied according to the geographic context  Re = 1.59-3.55 . In summary  our findings support that lineage Gamma was more transmissible and spread faster than P.2 in Brazil.

Vaccines are being deployed at scale  aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7  now dominant in the UK  with increased transmission  harbours 9 amino-acid changes in the spike  including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting-surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure function analysis of a large panel of well-characterised monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus  compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light chain contacts with residue 501. However  widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination was not observed.

Neutralizing antibody responses to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain that were generated during infection and vaccination showed lower effectiveness against variants of concern. Here  we demonstrated that mouse plasma induced by protein nanoparticles that present rationally designed S2GΔHR2 spikes can neutralize the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variants with comparable titers. The mechanism of nanoparticle vaccine-induced immunity was examined in mice for an I3–01v9 60-mer that presents 20 stabilized spikes. Compared with the soluble spike  this nanoparticle showed 6-fold longer retention  4-fold greater presentation on follicular dendritic cell dendrites  and 5-fold higher germinal center reactions in lymph node follicles. Intact nanoparticles in lymph node tissues were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion  spike-presenting protein nanoparticles that induce robust long-lived germinal centers may provide a vaccine solution for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Here we report the genome of a virus isolated in Pennsylvania in March 2021 that was identified as lineage B.1.1.7  VOC-202012 01  that also harbors the E484K spike mutation  which has been shown to promote “escape” from neutralizing antibodies in vitro. We compare this sequence to the only 5 other B.1.1.7+E484K genomes from Pennsylvania  all of which were isolated in mid March. Beginning in February 2021  only a small number  n=60  of isolates with this profile have been detected in the US  and only a total of 253 have been reported globally  first in the UK in December 2020 . Comparative genomics of all currently available high coverage B.1.1.7+E484K genomes  n=235  available on GISAID suggested the existence of 7 distinct groups or clonal complexes  CC; as defined by GNUVID  bearing the E484K mutation raising the possibility of 7 independent acquisitions of the E484K spike mutation in each background. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the presence of at least 3 distinct clades of B.1.1.7+E484K circulating in the US  with the Pennsylvanian isolates belonging to two distinct clades. Increased genomic surveillance will be crucial for detection of emerging variants of concern that can escape natural and vaccine induced immunity.

Before this event  the medical systems were almost unaffected. We aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the risk factors for therapeutic intervention of remdesivir during the fourth pandemic period in Wakayama  Japan. Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study enrolled 185 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 hospitalized in our hospital without intensive care between 14 March and 31 May 2021. Results: In this period  125  67.6%  of the 185 patients had the B.1.1.7 variant. Sixty-three patients  34.1%  required remdesivir treatment. Age upon admission and length of hospitalization were significantly different between remdesivir treatment and careful observation groups  mean  standard deviation ; 59.6  14.7  versus 45.3  20.6  years; p < 0.001 and median  interquartile range ; 10  9–12  versus 9  8–10  years; p < 0.001 . One patient was transferred to another hospital because of disease progression. At hospital admission  age ≥60 years  odds ratio  OR  6.90  p < 0.001   a previous history of diabetes mellitus  OR 20.9  p = 0.002   B.1.1.7 variant  OR 5.30; p = 0.005   lower respiratory symptoms  OR 3.13  p = 0.011   headache  OR 3.82  p = 0.011   and fever ≥37.5 °C  OR 4.55  p = 0.001  were independent risk factors to require remdesivir treatment during the admission. Conclusions: Many patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 required the therapeutic intervention of remdesivir during the fourth pandemic period in Wakayama  Japan. From the clinical data obtained at admission  these risk factors could contribute to a prediction regarding the requirement of remdesivir treatment in cases of mild to moderate COVID-19.

Several countries have implemented an extended interval of up to 12 weeks between the first and second vaccine doses to increase population coverage of single-dose vaccination. We aimed to assess the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune responses following a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine in LTCF residents and staff. METHODS: From the LTCFs participating in the ongoing VIVALDI study  ISRCTN14447421   staff and residents who had received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine  BNT162b2 [tozinameran] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19   had pre-vaccination and post-vaccination blood samples  collected between Dec 11  2020  and Feb 16  2021   and could be linked to a pseudoidentifier in the COVID-19 Data Store were included in our cohort. Past infection with SARS-CoV-2 was defined on the basis of nucleocapsid-specific IgG antibodies being detected through a semiquantitative immunoassay  and participants who tested positive on this assay after but not before vaccination were excluded from the study. Processed blood samples were assessed for spike-specific immune responses  including spike-specific IgG antibody titres  T-cell responses to spike protein peptide mixes  and inhibition of ACE2 binding by spike protein from four variants of SARS-CoV-2  the original strain as well as the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variants . Responses before and after vaccination were compared on the basis of age  previous infection status  role  staff or resident   and time since vaccination. FINDINGS: Our cohort comprised 124 participants from 14 LTCFs: 89  72%  staff  median age 48 years [IQR 35·5–56]  and 35  28%  residents  87 years [77–90] . Blood samples were collected a median 40 days  IQR 25–47; range 6–52  after vaccination. 30  24%  participants  18 [20%] staff and 12 [34%] residents  had serological evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants with previous infection had high antibody titres following vaccination that were independent of age  r s =0·076  p=0·70 . In participants without evidence of previous infection  titres were negatively correlated with age  r s =–0·434  p<0·0001  and were 8·2-times lower in residents than in staff. This effect appeared to result from a kinetic delay antibody generation in older infection-naive participants  with the negative age correlation disappearing only in samples taken more than 42 days post-vaccination  r s =–0·207  p=0·20; n=40   in contrast to samples taken after 0–21 days  r s =–0·774  p=0·0043; n=12  or 22–42 days  r s =–0·437  p=0·0034; n=43 . Spike-specific cellular responses were similar between older and younger participants. In infection-naive participants  antibody inhibition of ACE2 binding by spike protein from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain was negatively correlated with age  r s =–0·439  p<0·0001   and was significantly lower against spike protein from the B.1.351 variant  median inhibition 31% [14–100]  p=0·010  and the P.1 variant  23% [14–97]  p<0·0001  than against the original strain  58% [27–100] . By contrast  a single dose of vaccine resulted in around 100% inhibition of the spike–ACE2 interaction against all variants in people with a history of infection. INTERPRETATION: History of SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the magnitude and quality of antibody response after a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine in LTCF residents. Residents who are infection-naive have delayed antibody responses to the first dose of vaccine and should be considered for an early second dose where possible.

Accordingly  here we analyse antibodies and T cells of a recently vaccinated  UK cohort  alongside those recovering from natural infection in early 2020. We show that neutralization of the VOC compared to a reference isolate of the original circulating lineage  B  is reduced: more profoundly against B.1.351 than for B.1.1.7  and in responses to infection or a single dose of vaccine than to a second dose of vaccine. Importantly  high magnitude T cell responses are generated after two vaccine doses  with the majority of the T cell response directed against epitopes that are conserved between the prototype isolate B and the VOC. Vaccination is required to generate high potency immune responses to protect against these and other emergent variants.

Herein  we described the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Brazil from May to September 2020  to better understand viral changes that may affect the ongoing pandemic. Our data demonstrate that some of the mutations identified are currently observed in variants of interest and variants of concern  and emphasize the importance of studying previous periods in order to comprehend the emergence of new variants. From 720 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences  we found few sites under positive selection pressure  such as the D614G  98.5 %  in the spike  that has replaced the old variant; the V1167F in the spike  41 %   identified in the P.2 variant that emerged from Brazil during the period of analysis; and I292T  39 %  in the N protein. There were a few alterations in the UTRs  which was expected  however  our data suggest that the emergence of new variants was not influenced by mutations in UTR regions  since it maintained its conformational structure in most analysed sequences. In phylogenetic analysis  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the large urban centres to the countryside during these months could be explained by the flexibilization of social isolation measures and also could be associated with possible new waves of infection. These results allow a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 strains that have circulated in Brazil  and thus  with relevant infomation  provide the potential viral changes that may have affected and or contributed to the current and future scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This B.1.1.7 variant increased rapidly in prevalence among sequenced strains  attributed to an increase in infection and or transmission efficiency. The UK variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein  which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here  using a reverse genetics approach  we show that  of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions  only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 UK spike mutations  suggesting it is a major determinant responsible for increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically  the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil and South Africa  our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.

Nonetheless  data on the correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  viral genotypes and COVID-19 symptoms caused by them are still scarce. In this report  we present a moderately severe COVID-19 case in a healthcare worker in Moscow  Russia  supplemented with the data on its causative agent's phenotype regarding in vitro and full-genome characterization. The 44-year-old male healthcare worker who had frequent professional contacts with COVID-19 patients was hospitalized with a viral pneumonia diagnosis and soon started to exhibit fever  dry paroxysmal cough  loss of smell  and typical ground-glass opacities found in both lungs on chest CT scans. The COVID-19 diagnosis was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  qRT-PCR   immunochromatography  and immunochemiluminescent assays. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin  paracetamol  and enoxaparin  leading to his recovery after two weeks from the disease onset. The virus was successfully isolated from the nasopharyngeal swab sample taken on the fifth day of the disease onset using the Vero E6 cell line and exhibited a pronounced cytopathic effect  CPE  with a viral titer reaching 10 6  TCID 50  ml in the cell culture medium. The full genome sequence of the viral isolate was obtained and 8 nucleotide and 5 amino acid mutations compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome were identified. Viral isolate belonged to GR   20B   B.1.1 genetic lineage  GISAID  Nextstrain  Pangolin nomenclatures  respectively  - the most prevalent genotype found in Russia to date.

Hence  we reviewed related literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  RNA detected from household  biomedical waste  and sewage to identify possible health risks and status of existing laws  regulations  and policies regarding waste disposal in South Asian  SA  countries. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in sewage and wastewater samples of Nepal  India  Pakistan  and Bangladesh. Besides  this review reiterates the enormous amounts of PPE and other single-use plastic wastes generated from healthcare facilities and households in the SA region with inappropriate disposal  landfilling  and or incineration techniques wind-up polluting the environment. Consequently  the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in sewer treatment plant in India. Moreover  the overuse of non-biodegradable plastics during the pandemic is deteriorating plastic pollution condition and causes a substantial health risk to the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We recommend making necessary adjustments  adopting measures and strategies  and enforcement of the existing biomedical waste management and sanitation-related policy in SA countries. We propose to adopt the knowledge gaps to improve COVID-19-associated waste management and legislation to prevent further environmental pollution. Besides  the citizens should follow proper disposal procedures of COVID-19 waste to control the environmental pollution.

Emerging several variants of the virus with increased transmissibility  the severity of disease  and the ability of the virus to escape from the immune system has a cause for concerns. Here  we compared the spike protein sequence of 91 human SARS CoV2 strains of Iraq to the first reported sequence of SARS-CoV2 isolate from Wuhan Hu-1  China. The strains were isolated between June 2020 and March 2021. Twenty-two distinct mutations were identified within the spike protein regions which were: L5F  L18F  T19R  S151T  G181A  A222V  A348S  L452  Q or M   T478K  N501Y  A520S  A522V  A570D  S605A  D614G  Q675H  N679K  P681H  T716I  S982A  A1020S  D1118H. The most frequently mutations occurred at the D614G  87 91   followed by S982A  50 91   and A570D  48 50   respectively. In addition  a distinct shift was observed in the type of SARS-COV2 variants present in 2020 compared to 2021 isolates. In 2020  B.1.428.1 lineage was appeared to be a dominant variant  85% . However  the diversity of the variants increased in 2021  and the majority  73%  of the isolated were appeared to belong to B.1.1.7 lineage  VOC alpha variants . To our knowledge  this is the first major genome analysis of SARS-CoV2 in Iraq. The data from this research could provide insights into SARS-CoV2 evolution  and can be potentially used to recognize the effective vaccine against the disease.

Patient A had attended a large indoor convention in New York  New York with approximately 53 000 attendees from 52 U.S jurisdictions and 30 foreign countries during November 19-21  2021  and had close contact during 5 days with 29 fellow attendees. The convention required attendees to have received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose and enforced mask-use while indoors. On November 22  these close contact attendees were directly and immediately notified by patient A of their exposure to SARS-CoV-2  and they sought testing over the next few days while quarantined or isolated. As part of the larger investigation into SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the convention  a subinvestigation was conducted during December by CDC  MDH  and respective state and local health departments to characterize the epidemiology of Omicron variant infection among this group of close contacts and determine the extent of secondary household transmission. Among 30 convention attendees that included patient A  the index patient  and the 29 other close contacts  23 were interviewed  among whom all were fully vaccinated  including 11  48%  who had received a booster dose; all 23 sought testing  and 16  70%  received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Fewer attendees who had received a booster dose before the convention received a positive test result  six of 11  compared with those who had not received a booster dose  10 of 12 . The 16 attendees with positive test results had a total of 20 household contacts  18 of whom sought testing after exposure; six received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. None of the persons with positive test results was hospitalized or died. There was limited convention-associated transmission identified outside of this cluster; the larger investigation included cases of both SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  and Omicron  and all Omicron cases were associated with this group  1 . Data from this investigation reinforces the importance of COVID-19 booster doses in combination with early notification and other multicomponent prevention measures to limit transmission and prevent severe illness from Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However  ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike  the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants  we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses  harboring receptor-binding domain mutations  including K417N T  E484K  and N501Y  were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV  suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain  these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.

The use of personal protective equipment and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns have reduced infection and death rates worldwide. However  a recent increase in infection rates has been observed associated with the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants  including the more recently described lineage B.1.617.2  Delta variant  and lineage B.1.1.529 BA.1  Omicron variant . These new variants put the effectiveness of international vaccination at risk  with the appearance of new outbreaks of COVID-19 throughout the world. This emergence of new variants has been due to multiple predisposing factors  including molecular characteristics of the virus  geographic and environmental conditions  and the impact of social determinants of health that favor the genetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2. We present a literature review on the most recent information available on the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the world. We analyzed the biological  geographical  and sociocultural factors that favor the development of these variants. Finally  we evaluate the surveillance strategies for the early detection of new variants and prevent their distribution outside these regions.

In this study we evaluated if commercially available quantitative real-time PCR  qRT-PCR  assay can identify SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared to the S or RdRp gene. METHODS: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7  n=48  and non-B.1.1.7 samples  n=58  were analysed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV™ PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S  RdRp and N gene. N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without D3L mutation  specific for B.1.1.7  was cloned into pCR®-TOPO vectors to validate polymorphism dependent N gene dropout with Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV™ PCR assay. RESULTS: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR  Δ 6-10  N gene dropout on Ct values >29  of N gene compared to the corresponding values of S  p ≤ 0.0001  and RdRp  p ≤ 0.0001  genes. The assay reliably discriminated B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 positive samples  area under the curve AUC = 1  in a receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curve analysis. Identical Ct shifts  Δ 7-10  were detected in reverse genetic experiments  using isolated plasmids containing N gene coding sequences corresponding to D3 or 3L variants. CONCLUSIONS: A N gene dropout or Ct value shift is shown for B.1.1.7-positive samples in the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics.

From March 23 to December 31  2020  there were 33 917 confirmed cases and 741 deaths in Myanmar  case fatality rate of 2.18% . The first wave in Myanmar from March to July was linked to overseas travel  and then a second wave started from Rakhine State  a western border state  leading to the second wave spreading countrywide in Myanmar from August to December 2020. The estimated effective reproductive number  R t   nationwide reached 6–8 at the beginning of each wave and gradually decreased as the epidemic spread to the community. The whole-genome analysis of 10 Myanmar SARS-CoV-2 strains together with 31 previously registered strains showed that the first wave was caused by GISAID clade O or PANGOLIN lineage B.6 and the second wave was changed to clade GH or lineage B.1.36.16 with a close genetic relationship with other South Asian strains. Constant monitoring of epidemiological situations combined with SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis is important for adjusting public health measures to mitigate the community transmissions of COVID-19.

However  acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19 among HCWs has not been universal and emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility  reduced neutralization by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera and ability to cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals is concerning. The aim of this study was to compare viral load  clinical presentation at diagnosis and type of exposure among vaccinated  with BNT162b2  and non-vaccinated healthcare workers  HCWs . METHODS: Prospective cohort of HWCs diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR from 4 January to 14 April. Viral loads were expressed by the cycle threshold  Ct  in PCR. RESULTS: During the study period 55 HCWs were found positive for SARS-CoV-2  most of whom  44 55  were identified from March 28 to April 14 during an in-hospital COVID-19 outbreak. Of the 55 HCWs  21 were fully vaccinated and another three had received one dose. Most cases  54 55  were due to variant B.1.1.7. Vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs did not differ significantly in regards to age  gender  site of acquisition  presence of symptoms at diagnosis and viral load. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a similar viral load in vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7  suggesting potentially reduced efficacy of BNT162b2 in preventing transmission of B.1.1.7.

Along with human beings  several species of wild and pet animals have been demonstrated to be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2  both naturally and experimentally. In addition  with constant emergence of new variants  the species susceptibility might further change which warrants intensified screening efforts. India is a vast and second most populated country  with a habitat of a very diverse range of animal species. In this study we place on record of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in three captive Asiatic lions. Detailed genomic characterization revealed involvement of Delta mutant  Pango lineage B.1.617.2  of SARS‐CoV‐2 at two different locations. Interestingly  no other feline species enclosed in the zoo park were found infected. The epidemiological and molecular analysis will contribute to the understanding of the emerging mutants of SARS‐CoV‐2 in wild and domestic animals.

In Madrid  recent start of the decline of predominant VOC Alpha suggested an equivalent phenomenon. However  11 different variants  none overrepresented in frequency  occupied progressively over a period of 7 weeks the niche previously dominated by VOC Alpha. Only after these 7 weeks  VOC Delta started to emerge. Viral competition due to the entry of VOC Delta is not the major force driving the start of VOC Alpha decline in Madrid. IMPORTANCE Our data indicate that the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs turnover in our setting differ from those proposed for other countries. A systematic genomic analysis  updated on a weekly basis  of representative randomly selected samples of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants allowed us to define a lapse of 7 weeks between the start of VOC Alpha decline and the final emergence of VOC Delta. During this period  VOC Alpha showed a sustained decline  while 11 VOCs  variants of interest  VOIs   and other identified variants  none overrepresented  occupied the niche left by VOC Alpha. Only after these 7 weeks  emergence of VOC Delta occurred  indicating that viral competition involving VOC Delta was not the exclusive direct driving force behind the starting of VOC Alpha decline.

Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir  RDV  and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies  mAb  have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2  the causative agent of COVID-19. However  it is not known if combination RDV mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted model of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis  we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials  C144 and C135  have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 hours after infection. The same antibody combination was also effective in prevention and therapy against the B.1.351 variant of concern  VOC . Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared to single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and support the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Some of these variants have resulted in transmissibility changes of the virus and may also have impact on diagnosis  therapeutics and even vaccines  thereby raising particular concerns in the scientific community. The variants which have mutations in Spike glycoprotein are the primary focus as it is the main target for neutralising antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect human through Spike glycoprotein and uses receptor-binding domain  RBD  to bind to the ACE2 receptor in human. Thus  it is of utmost importance to study these variants and their corresponding mutations. Such 12 different important variants identified so far are B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   B.1.525  Eta   B.1.427 B.1.429  Epsilon   B.1.526  Iota   B.1.617.1  Kappa   B.1.617.2  Delta   C.37  Lambda   P.1  Gamma   P.2  Zeta   P.3  Theta  and the recently discovered B.1.1.529  Omicron . These variants have 84 unique mutations in Spike glycoprotein. To analyse such mutations  multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 is performed followed by phylogenetic analysis. Also  characteristics of new emerging variants are elaborately discussed. The individual evolution of these mutation points and the respective variants are visualised and their characteristics are also reported. Moreover  to judge the characteristics of the non-synonymous mutation points  substitutions   their biological functions are evaluated by PolyPhen-2 while protein structural stability is evaluated using I-Mutant 2.0.

In the United States  COVID-19 cases and deaths have markedly declined since their peak in early January 2021  due in part to increased vaccination coverage  1 . However  during June 19-July 23  2021  COVID-19 cases increased approximately 300% nationally  followed by increases in hospitalizations and deaths  driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2  Delta  variant* of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19. Available data indicate that the vaccines authorized in the United States  Pfizer-BioNTech  Moderna  and Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]  offer high levels of protection against severe illness and death from infection with the Delta variant and other currently circulating variants of the virus  2 . Despite widespread availability  vaccine uptake has slowed nationally with wide variation in coverage by state  range = 33.9%-67.2%  and by county  range = 8.8%-89.0% .† Unvaccinated persons  as well as persons with certain immunocompromising conditions  3   remain at substantial risk for infection  severe illness  and death  especially in areas where the level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is high. The Delta variant is more than two times as transmissible as the original strains circulating at the start of the pandemic and is causing large  rapid increases in infections  which could compromise the capacity of some local and regional health care systems to provide medical care for the communities they serve. Until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission is low  public health practitioners  as well as schools  businesses  and institutions  organizations  need to regularly assess the need for prevention strategies to avoid stressing health care capacity and imperiling adequate care for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19 conditions. CDC recommends five critical factors be considered to inform local decision-making: 1  level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission; 2  health system capacity; 3  COVID-19 vaccination coverage; 4  capacity for early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases; and 5  populations at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Among strategies to prevent COVID-19  CDC recommends all unvaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings. Based on emerging evidence on the Delta variant  2   CDC also recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing a mask in public indoor settings  regardless of transmission level  if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or is at increased risk for severe disease  or if someone in their household is unvaccinated  including children aged <12 years who are currently ineligible for vaccination .

Although vaccinations have shown high efficacy  the emergence of novel variants of concern  VOCs  has already exhibited traits of immune evasion. Thus  the development of tailored antiviral medications for patients with incomplete  inefficient  or non-existent immunization  is essential. The attachment of viral surface proteins to the cell surface is the first crucial step in the viral replication cycle  which for SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the high affinity interaction of the viral trimeric spike with the host cell surface-located human angiotensin converting enzyme-2  hACE2 . Here  we used a novel and efficient next generation sequencing  NGS  supported phage display strategy for the selection of a set of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain  RBD -targeting peptide ligands that bind to the target protein with low µM to nM dissociation constants. Compound CVRBDL-3 inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein association to hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner for pre- as well as post-complex formation conditions. Further rational optimization yielded a CVRBDL-3 based divalent compound  which demonstrated inhibitory efficacy with an IC 50  value of 47 nM. The obtained compounds were not only efficient for the different spike constructs from the originally isolated “wt” SARS-CoV-2  but also for B.1.1.7 mutant trimeric spike protein. Our work demonstrates that phage display-derived peptide ligands are potential fusion inhibitors of viral cell entry. Moreover  we show that rational optimization of a combination of peptide sequences is a potential strategy in the further development of therapeutics for the treatment of acute COVID-19.

Several recent reports have described a series of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Some of these have been identified as variants of concern  VOCs   including alpha  B.1.1.7  Clade GRY   beta  B.1.351  Clade GH   gamma  P.1  Clade GR   and delta  B.1.617.2  Clade G . VOCs are likely to have some effect on transmissibility  antibody evasion  and changes in therapeutic or vaccine effectiveness. However  the physiological and virological understanding of these variants remains poor. We demonstrated that these four VOCs exhibited differences in plaque size  thermal stability at physiological temperature  and replication rates. The mean plaque size of beta was the largest  followed by those of gamma  delta  and alpha. Thermal stability  evaluated by measuring infectivity and half-life after prolonged incubation at physiological temperature  was correlated with plaque size in all variants except alpha. However  despite its relatively high thermal stability  alpha’s small plaque size resulted in lower replication rates and fewer progeny viruses. Our findings may inform further virological studies of SARS-CoV-2 variant characteristics  VOCs  and variants of interest. These studies are important for the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address whether mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD spike protein could affect virus infectivity  peptides containing RBD amino acids mutations have been constructed and interacted with human ACE2 by computational methods. Our results suggest that mutations in RBD amino acids K417  E484  L452  T478 and N501 are expressively increasing the affinity of this protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   consequently variants Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B1.351   Gamma  P.1  and Delta  B.1.617.2  could be more infective in human cells compared with SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan-2019 and the Gamma and Delta variants could be the most infective among them.

Sequencing of the virus has been performed at scale  with many countries depositing data into open access repositories to enable in-depth global phylogenetic analysis. To contribute to these efforts  we established an Oxford Nanopore Technologies  ONT  sequencing capability at the National Institutes of Health  NIH   Pakistan. This study highlights multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating during the peak of a second COVID-19 wave in Pakistan  Nov 2020-Feb 2021   with virus origins traced to the United States of America and Saudi Arabia. Ten SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were used for ONT library preparation. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis determined that the patients were infected with lineage B.1.1.250  originally identified in the United Kingdom and Bangladesh during March and April of 2020  and in circulation until the time of this study in Europe  USA and Australia. Lineage B.1.261 was originally identified in Saudi Arabia with widespread local dissemination in Pakistan. One sample clustered with the parental B.1 lineage and the other with lineage B.6 originally from Singapore. In the future  monitoring the evolutionary dynamics of circulating lineages in Pakistan will enable improved tracing of the viral spread  changing trends of their expansion trajectories  persistence  changes in their demographic dynamics  and provide guidance for better implementation of control measures.

So far  the infection features and immune escape ability of the Omicron variant have not been extensively studied. Here  we produced the Omicron pseudovirus and compared its entry  membrane fusion  and immune escape efficiency with the original strain and the dominating Delta variant. We found the Omicron variant showed slightly higher infectivity than the Delta variant and a similar ability to compete with the Delta variant in using Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  in a BHK21-ACE2 cell line. However  the Omicron showed a significantly reduced fusogenicity than the original strain and the Delta variant in both BHK21-ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. The neutralization assay testing the Wuhan convalescents’ sera one-year post-infection showed a more dramatic reduction  10.15 fold  of neutralization against the Omicron variant than the Delta variant  1.79 fold  compared with the original strain with D614G. Notably  immune-boosting through three vaccine shots significantly improved the convalescents’ immunity against the Omicron variants. Our results reveal a reduced fusogenicity and a striking immune escape ability of the Omicron variant  highlighting the importance of booster shots against the challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift.

In Ontario  Canada  the wild type was overtaken first by the Alpha B1.1.17 variant  and then by the Delta B.1.617 variant. The principal objective of the present study is to develop and apply a much expanded Susceptible-Infection-Recovered-type model to better understand the spread of multiple VOC  and assess the effectiveness of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPI . The model represents competition among VOC  and reveals their mutual inhibitory effects. By separately tracking asymptomatic and symptomatic infections  model simulations identify a significant role of vaccine breakthrough in the spread of Delta. Furthermore  the severity of a Delta outbreak depends not only on the NPI and vaccination rate but also on the vaccine types. Alarmingly  despite Ontario’s existing NPI and relatively successful vaccine rollout  a future  more dangerous VOC could potentially infect a significant fraction of the province’s population and overwhelm the health care system. To stop that VOC  the province may need the simultaneous and rapid deployment of a third booster vaccine and stringent NPI.

Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity  we measured the neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273  111 BNT162b  and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild-type  Delta  and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that received their primary series recently  <3 months   distantly  6–12 months   or an additional “booster” dose  while accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably  neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinees. However  individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron  only 4–6-fold lower than wild type  suggesting enhanced cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition  we find that Omicron pseudovirus infects more efficiently than other variants tested. Overall  this study highlights the importance of additional mRNA doses to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However  theories predict that robust  therapeutic DIPs  i.e.  Therapeutic Interfering Particles–TIPs  must conditionally spread between cells with R0>1. Here  we report engineering of TIPs that conditionally replicate with SARS-CoV-2  exhibit R0>1  and inhibit viral replication 10–100 fold. Inhibition occurs via competition for viral replication machinery and  a single administration of TIP RNA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 sustainably in continuous cultures. Strikingly  TIPs maintain efficacy against neutralization-resistant variants  e.g.  B.1.351 . In hamsters  both prophylactic and therapeutic intranasal administration of lipid-nanoparticle TIPs durably suppressed SARS-CoV-2 by 100 fold in the lungs  reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression  and prevented severe pulmonary edema. These data provide proof-of-concept for a class of single-administration antivirals that may circumvent current requirements to continually update medical countermeasures against new variants.

High frequencies of Spike-specific germinal center B  Th0 Th1 CD4  and CD8 T cell responses were observed in mice.

In hamsters  the vaccine candidate was well-tolerated  markedly reduced viral load in the upper and lower airways  and protected animals against disease in a dose-dependent manner  with no evidence of disease enhancement following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Therefore  the SARS-CoV-2 SAM  LNP  vaccine candidate has a favorable safety profile  elicits robust protective immune responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants  and has been advanced to Phase-1 clinical evaluation  NCT04758962 .

We studied the associated molecular epidemiology and SARS‐CoV‐2 seroprevalence during the third wave. We obtained 60 whole‐genome SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences between October 2020 and January 2021 in Kuala Lumpur Selangor and analyzed 989 available Malaysian sequences. We tested 653 residual serum samples collected between December 2020 to April 2021 for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 total antibodies  as a proxy for population immunity. The first wave  January 2020  comprised sporadic imported cases from China of early Pango lineages A and B. The second wave  March–June 2020  was associated with lineage B.6. The ongoing third wave  from September 2020  was propagated by a state election in Sabah. It is due to lineage B.1.524 viruses containing spike mutations D614G and A701V. Lineages B.1.459  B.1.470  and B.1.466.2 were likely imported from the region and confined to Sarawak state. Direct age‐standardized seroprevalence in Kuala Lumpur Selangor was 3.0%. The second and third waves were driven by super‐spreading events and different circulating lineages. Malaysia is highly susceptible to further waves  especially as alpha  B.1.1.7  and beta  B.1.351  variants of concern were first detected in December 2020 January 2021. Increased genomic surveillance is critical.

This investigation of R t  estimations was conducted to guide the national COVID-19 response in Qatar  from the onset of the pandemic until August 18  2021. METHODS: Real-time “empirical” R t  Empirical  was estimated using five methods  including the Robert Koch Institute  Cislaghi  Systrom-Bettencourt and Ribeiro  Wallinga and Teunis  and Cori et al. methods. R t  was also estimated using a transmission dynamics model  R t  Model-based  . Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Correlations between different R t  estimates were assessed by calculating correlation coefficients  and agreements between these estimates were assessed through Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: R t  Empirical  captured the evolution of the pandemic through three waves  public health response landmarks  effects of major social events  transient fluctuations coinciding with significant clusters of infection  and introduction and expansion of the Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant. The various estimation methods produced consistent and overall comparable R t  Empirical  estimates with generally large correlation coefficients. The Wallinga and Teunis method was the fastest at detecting changes in pandemic dynamics. R t  Empirical  estimates were consistent whether using time series of symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases  all PCR-confirmed cases  acute-care hospital admissions  or ICU-care hospital admissions  to proxy trends in true infection incidence. R t  Model-based  correlated strongly with R t  Empirical  and provided an average R t  Empirical . CONCLUSIONS: R t  estimations were robust and generated consistent results regardless of the data source or the method of estimation. Findings affirmed an influential role for R t  estimations in guiding national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic  even in resource-limited settings.

We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues  404  416  504  252  as well as residues K417  D467 and N501  including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7  501.V2 and P1 strains. This is  to our knowledge  the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

Antiviral NL-CVX1 Efficiently Blocks Infection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants of Concern  VOC ,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.131,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.131,,pmc:PMC8644688,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,131. Antiviral NL-CVX1 Efficiently Blocks Infection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants of Concern  VOC ,BACKGROUND: Using a computational approach  NL-CVX1 was developed by Neoleukin Therapeutics  Inc. to create a de novo protein that both blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection and is highly resilient to viral escape. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of NL-CVX1 against variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain  including important viral variants of concern  VOC  such as B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. METHODS: The relative binding affinity of NL-CVX1 to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein of VOC was measured using biolayer interferometry  Octet . A competitive ELISA measured the ability of NL-CVX1 to compete with hACE2 for binding to the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the original strain and VOC. The activity of NL-CVX1 in preventing viral infection was assessed by evaluating the cytopathic effects  CPE  of SARS-CoV-2 in a transmembrane protease  serine 2-expressing Vero E6 cell line  Vero E6 TMPRSS2  and determining the viral load using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in infected cells. A K18hACE2 mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection was used to study the dose-response of NL-CVX1 anti-viral activity in vivo. RESULTS: NL-CVX1 binds the RBD of different VOC of SARS-CoV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations  Fig 1; K d  < 1-~5 nM . When competing with hACE2  NL-CVX1 achieved 100% inhibition against hACE2 binding to the RBD of different VOC with IC50s values ranging from 0.7-53 nM  Fig 2 . NL-CVX1 neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant as efficiently as the original strain in Vero E6 TMPRSS2 cells  with EC50 values of 16 nM and 101.2 nM  respectively  Fig 3 . In mice  we found that a single intranasal dose of 100 µg NL-CVX1 prevented clinically significant SARS-CoV-2 infection and protected mice from succumbing to infection. Results from additional in vitro and in vivo experiments to be conducted this summer will be presented. [Image: see text] Figure 1. NL-CVX1 binds the RBD from multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations. [Image: see text] Figure 2. NL-CVX1 achieves 100% inhibition against all strains tested  including SARS-CoV-2 VOC. [Image: see text] Figure 3. NL-CVX1 neutralizes the B.1.1.7 variant as efficiently as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. CONCLUSION: In vitro and in vivo data  Fig 4  demonstrate that NL-CVX1 is a promising drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. As a hACE2 mimetic  it is resilient to antibody escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOC. NL-CVX1 further demonstrates the power and utility of de novo protein design for developing proteins as human therapeutics. [Image: see text] Figure 4.

Here we show therapeutic antibody ADG20 is able to neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs  including Omicron  B.1.1.529  as well as other SARS-related coronaviruses. We delineate the structural basis of this relatively escape-resistant epitope that extends from one end of the receptor binding site  RBS  into the highly conserved CR3022 site. ADG20 can then benefit from high potency through direct competition with ACE2 in the more variable RBS and interaction with the more highly conserved CR3022 site. Importantly  antibodies that are able to target this site generally neutralize all VOCs  albeit with reduced potency against Omicron. Thus  this highly conserved and vulnerable site can be exploited for design of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.

COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers  HCWs  starting in January 2021. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection. DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi  India. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with 0  1  or 2 doses of BBV152. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated  with 2 doses and ≥15 days after the second dose   partially vaccinated  with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose   or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed  and events from March 3  2020  to June 18  2021  were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios  HRs  were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness  1 − adjusted HR  was reported. RESULTS: Among 15 244 HCWs who participated in the study  4978  32.7%  were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean  SD  age was 36.6  10.3  years  and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26  95% CI: 6.09-8.66  per 100 person-years  124 HCWs [2.5%]  total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk . Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection  HR  0.14 [95% CI  0.08-0.23]   symptomatic reinfection  HR  0.13 [95% CI  0.07-0.24]   and asymptomatic reinfection  HR  0.16 [95% CI  0.05-0.53]  compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly  among the 3 vaccine categories  reinfection was observed in 60 of 472  12.7%  of unvaccinated  incidence density  18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI  14.02-23.25   39 of 356  11.0%  of partially vaccinated  incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI  11.42-21.38   and 17 of 1089  1.6%  fully vaccinated  incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI  1.35-3.51  HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86%  95% CI  77%-92% ; symptomatic reinfection  87%  95% CI  76%-93% ; and asymptomatic reinfection  84%  95% CI  47%-95%  among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule  when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2.

Three recently detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1   have been scrutinized because they are unusually divergent and each possesses a unique constellation of mutations of potential biological importance  several of which are in the gene coding for the Spike protein. We briefly summarize the current knowledge on these variants  and their possible implications.

As of December 2021  the AY.4.2 Delta sub-lineage represented 20 % of sequenced strains in the UK and had been detected in dozens of countries. It has since then been supplanted by Omicron. The AY.4.2 spike displays three additional mutations  T95I  Y145H and A222V  in the N-terminal domain when compared to the original Delta variant  B.1.617.2  and remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We compared the Delta and the AY.4.2 spikes  by assessing their binding to antibodies and ACE2 and their fusogenicity. We studied the sensitivity of an authentic AY.4.2 viral isolate to neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: The AY.4.2 spike exhibited similar binding to all the antibodies and sera tested  and similar fusogenicity and binding to ACE2 than the ancestral Delta spike. The AY.4.2 virus was slightly less sensitive than Delta to neutralization by a panel of monoclonal antibodies; noticeably  the anti-RBD Imdevimab showed incomplete neutralization. Sensitivity of AY.4.2 to sera from vaccinated individuals was reduced by 1.3 to 3-fold  when compared to Delta. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that mutations in the NTD remotely impair the efficacy of anti-RBD antibodies. The spread of AY.4.2 was not due to major changes in spike fusogenicity or ACE2 binding  but more likely to a partially reduced neutralization sensitivity.

In this study  we show that the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine and the adenovirus vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine provide robust protection against high-dose challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in cynomolgus macaques. We vaccinated 30 macaques with homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S. Following Omicron challenge  vaccinated macaques demonstrated rapid control of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage  and most vaccinated animals also controlled virus in nasal swabs. However  4 vaccinated animals that had moderate Omicron neutralizing antibody titers and undetectable Omicron CD8+ T cell responses failed to control virus in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover  virologic control correlated with both antibody and T cell responses. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to vaccine protection against a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant.

In this work  we characterized an OXA-484 carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli strain from a Swiss patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 and repatriated from India. Methods At admission to Switzerland  April  2021   the patient undertook a molecular nasopharyngeal swab to search for SARS-CoV-2 and a rectal swab to detect multidrug-resistant bacteria. Both SARS-CoV-2 and E. coli isolates were whole-genome sequenced and analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness. Results The patient was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 lineage  VOC Delta   a lineage that started to be reported across Switzerland at that time. He was also colonized with a sequence type  ST  410 E. coli strain  L3452210II  producing the OXA-484  a single amino acid variant of OXA-181. The bla OXA-484 was carried by a 51.5 kb IncX3 plasmid identical to those described in bla OXA-181-harboring ST410 E. coli strains. Core-genome analysis showed that L3452210II was identical  ∆SNV ≤23  to two ST410 OXA-484 producers recently reported in Qatar and Germany  but differed from other ST410 OXA-181 producers reported worldwide. Conclusions The patient was infected by an emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant  and also imported an E.coli producing OXA-484  an OXA-48-like carbapenemase not yet reported in Switzerland. The genetic background of L3452210II indicated that the bla OXA-484 shared the same plasmid of bla OXA-181  but its bacterial host differed from most of the pandemic OXA-181-producing ST410 strains previously reported. This case description underlines that the COVID-19 crisis can contribute to the worldwide spread of emerging carbapenemase producers.

In contrast  heterologous polyclonal antibodies raised against S protein  through the recognition of multiple target epitopes  have the potential to maintain neutralization capacities. XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives  RBMs   in direct contact sites with the angiotensin converting enzyme-2  ACE-2 . Therefore  in Spike ACE-2 interaction assays  XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom  Alpha B.1.1.7  and South African  Beta B.1.351  variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil  Gamma P.1  and the Indian  Delta B.1.617.2  variants. In a selective pressure study on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month  no mutation was associated with the addition of increasing doses of XAV-19. The potential to reduce viral load in lungs was confirmed in a human ACE-2 transduced mouse model. XAV-19 is currently evaluated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia in phase 2a-2b  NCT04453384  where safety was already demonstrated and in an ongoing 2 3 trial  NCT04928430  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XAV-19 in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Owing to its polyclonal nature and its glyco-humanization  XAV-19 may provide a novel safe and effective therapeutic tool to mitigate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  including the different variants of concern identified so far.

Using a two-strain mathematical model calibrated on genomic surveillance  we estimated that curfew measures allowed hospitalisations to plateau by decreasing transmission of the historical strains while B.1.1.7 continued to grow. School holidays appear to have further slowed down progression in February. Without progressively strengthened social distancing  a rapid surge of hospitalisations is expected  despite the foreseen increase in vaccination rhythm.

This study’s objective was to describe the introduction and expansion of this variant in Qatar and to estimate the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection with this variant. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Reinfections with the B.1.1.7 variant and variants of unknown status were investigated in a national cohort of 158 608 individuals with prior PCR-confirmed infections and a national cohort of 42 848 antibody-positive individuals. Infections with B.1.1.7 and variants of unknown status were also investigated in a national comparator cohort of 132 701 antibody-negative individuals. B.1.1.7 was first identified in Qatar on 25 December 2020. Sudden  large B.1.1.7 epidemic expansion was observed starting on 18 January 2021  triggering the onset of epidemic’s second wave  7 months after the first wave. B.1.1.7 was about 60% more infectious than the original  wild-type  circulating variants. Among persons with a prior PCR-confirmed infection  the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated to be 97.5%  95% CI: 95.7% to 98.6%  for B.1.1.7 and 92.2%  95% CI: 90.6% to 93.5%  for variants of unknown status. Among antibody-positive persons  the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated to be 97.0%  95% CI: 92.5% to 98.7%  for B.1.1.7 and 94.2%  95% CI: 91.8% to 96.0%  for variants of unknown status. A main limitation of this study is assessment of reinfections based on documented PCR-confirmed reinfections  but other reinfections could have occurred and gone undocumented. CONCLUSIONS: In this study  we observed that introduction of B.1.1.7 into a naïve population can create a major epidemic wave  but natural immunity in those previously infected was strongly associated with limited incidence of reinfection by B.1.1.7 or other variants.

This is underscored by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants  including Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Delta  B.1.617.2   some of which appear to be less effectively targeted by current monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain  RBD   which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies  using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures  we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering. We also identified the energetic and conservation features of epitope residues and assessed the capacity of viral variant mutations to disrupt antibody recognition  revealing sets of antibodies predicted to effectively target recently described viral variants. This detailed structure-based reference of antibody RBD recognition signatures can inform therapeutic and vaccine design strategies.

Amongst 1858 HCWs  1639 had received either two doses  1346  or a single dose  293  of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were measured in the vaccinated group and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection was monitored.Forty-six RT-PCR positive samples from the 203 positive samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing  WGS . Of the 203  10.92%  infected HCWs  21.46%  47 219  were non-vaccinated  which was significantly more than 9.52%  156 1639  who were vaccinated and infection was higher in doctors and nurses. Unvaccinated HCWs had 1.57 times higher risk compared to partially vaccinated HCWs and 2.49 times higher risk than those who were fully vaccinated.The partially vaccinated were at higher risk than the fully vaccinated  RR 1.58 . Antibody non-response was seen in 3.44%  4 116   low antibody levels in 15.51%  18 116  and medium levels were found in 81.03%  94 116 . Fully vaccinated HCWs had a higher antibody response at day 42 than those who were partially vaccinated  8.96 + 4.00 vs. 7.17 + 3.82 . Whole genome sequencing of 46 samples revealed that the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  was predominant  69.5% . HCWs who had received two doses of vaccine showed better protection from mild  moderate  or severe infection  with a higher humoral immune response than those who had received a single dose. The genomic analysis revealed the predominance of the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  in the VBT infections.

Studies of vaccine effectiveness  VE  for preventing new infections and hospitalizations attributable to SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19   particularly as the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant has become predominant  are limited in the United States  3 . In this study  the New York State Department of Health linked statewide immunization  laboratory testing  and hospitalization databases for New York to estimate rates of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by vaccination status among adults  as well as corresponding VE for full vaccination in the population  across all three authorized vaccine products. During May 3-July 25  2021  the overall age-adjusted VE against new COVID-19 cases for all adults declined from 91.8% to 75.0%. During the same period  the overall age-adjusted VE against hospitalization was relatively stable  ranging from 89.5% to 95.1%. Currently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization  but effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months  coinciding with the Delta variant's increase from <2% to >80% in the U.S. region that includes New York and relaxation of masking and physical distancing recommendations. To reduce new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations  these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination  as well as other prevention strategies such as masking and physical distancing.

Based on the trend of the loss of protective IgG antibodies after the first wave and the seropositivity of 75% in the district in July 2021  simple forecasting and proportional estimates of the seropositivity in the next eight months and the estimated maximum number of the cases was done. We also considered the seropositivity without vaccination in July 2021  63% . Additionally  the trend of the weekly RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 may also preemptively predict an imminent wave. Based on the East Singhbhum population and the vaccination coverage with at least one dose till July 2021  Covishield or Covaxin   it is estimated that a 4-5% monthly vaccination coverage rate of new individuals will not allow the seropositivity to fall below 50% and hold at bay a major wave. Vaccination coverage of 3% or less would allow a continuous drop in acquired immunity in the district and can potentially cause a rise in cases  making the community susceptible to a future surge of infections. A 3-5% vaccination rate of new individuals is unlikely to see a drop in the community seropositivity below 50% and the number of new cases of COVID-19 infections going above 478 to 712 per month at least till March 2022. The assumptions are based on presuming that there will be no new mutant of SARS-CoV-2 that escapes the immunity provided by previous infection or vaccination over the next eight months. However  currently  there is no evidence to speculate on any new variant of concern causing a major wave globally. The B.1.617.2  delta  variant was first identified in October 2020 and there was a lag of six months to the second surge of COVID-19 infections in East Singhbhum  primarily caused by this variant. Additionally  3% and above  with a rising weekly trend of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  positivity for SARS-CoV-2 can provide at least four to eight weeks advance warning before the peak of the wave if an imminent future wave is impending.

P.1 has been linked to increased infectivity  higher mortality  and immune evasion  leading to reinfections and potentially reduced efficacy of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: The samples of 276 patients from the State of Amazonas were sent to a central referral laboratory for sequencing by gold standard techniques  through Illumina MiSeq platform. Both global and regional phylogenetic analyses of the successfully sequenced genomes were conducted through maximum likelihood method. Multiple alignments were obtained including previously obtained unique human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The evolutionary histories of spike and non-structural proteins from ORF1a of northern genomes were described and their molecular evolution was analyzed for detection of positive  FUBAR  FEL  and MEME  and negative  FEL and SLAC  selective pressures. To further evaluate the possible pathways of evolution leading to the emergence of P.1  we performed specific analysis for copy-choice recombination events. A global phylogenomic analysis with subsampled P.1 and B.1.1.28 genomes was applied to evaluate the relationship among samples. RESULTS: Forty-four samples from the State of Amazonas were successfully sequenced and confirmed as P.1  Gamma  lineage. In addition to previously described P.1 characteristic mutations  we find evidence of continuous diversification of SARS-CoV-2  as rare and previously unseen P.1 mutations were detected in spike and non-structural protein from ORF1a. No evidence of recombination was found. Several sites were demonstrated to be under positive and negative selection  with various mutations identified mostly in P.1 lineage. According to the Pango assignment  phylogenomic analyses indicate all samples as belonging to the P.1 lineage. CONCLUSION: P.1 has shown continuous evolution after its emergence. The lack of clear evidence for recombination and the positive selection demonstrated for several sites suggest that this lineage emergence resulted mainly from strong evolutionary forces and progressive accumulation of a favorable signature set of mutations.

As the pandemic advances  a few lineages have become dominant in certain areas which has led to a new type of reinfection by extremely similar strains. Here  we report a reinfection within the same clade in a symptomatic 28-year-old-male in Quito-Ecuador. METHODS: Infection was detected by RT-PCR  immune response was evaluated by antibody testing  patient identity was confirmed by fingerprint. Relatedness was determined through bioinformatics analysis of Illumina WGS samples. RESULTS: Both  the infection and the reinfection strains  were assigned as Nextstrain 20B  Pangolin lineage B.1.1 and GISAID clade O. Our analysis indicated more nucleotide changes than what is expected for reactivation or persistence  4-6 fold more  based on the natural rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 of  ≈2-3 nucleotide changes per month   thus supporting a reinfection. Furthermore  after three months of the second infection the patient appears to be susceptible to a new SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within the same clade in Ecuador proving that previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not guarantee immunity in all cases.

This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a 53-year-old woman from Apulia  Italy   who was COVID-19 positive for approximately four months. In this paper we aimed to investigate any potential correlation between genetic mutations and clinical features of this case of infection. The viral isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.177.51 through whole-genome sequencing  WGS  and harbored a novel set of mutations on the Spike protein  V143D  del144 145 and E484K ; furthermore  seroneutralization assays showed impaired response of the surveyed strain to BNT162b2  Comirnaty  Pfizer BioNTech vaccine-induced  average reduction of 70%  and convalescent sera  average reduction of 19.04%   when compared to VOC P.1. This study highlights the importance of genomic surveillance for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic  the relevance of monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations in all lineages  and the necessity of testing the response of emerging variants to available therapies and vaccines.

Brazil is the third worst-hit country  with approximately 10.2 million cases and 250 thousand deaths. International efforts have been established to share information about Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  epidemiology and evolution to support the development of effective strategies for public health and disease management. We aimed to analyze the high-quality genome sequences from Brazil from February 2020-2021 to identify mutation hotspots  geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses. We describe heterogeneous sequencing efforts  the progression of the different lineages along time  evaluating mutational spectra and frequency oscillations derived from the prevalence of specific lineages across different Brazilian regions. We found at least seven major  1–7  and two minor clades related to the six most prevalent lineages in the country and described its spatial distribution and dynamics. The emergence and recent frequency shift of lineages  P.1 and P.2  carrying mutations of concern in the spike protein  e. g.  E484K  N501Y  draws attention due to their association with immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding affinity. Improvements in genomic surveillance are of paramount importance and should be extended in Brazil to better inform policy makers about better decisions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

This increased infection rate coincided with a rapid increase in paediatric COVID-19-associated admissions to hospital  hereafter referred to as hospitalisations . METHODS: The Tshwane Maternal-Child COVID-19 study is a multicentre observational study in which we investigated the clinical manifestations and outcomes of paediatric patients  aged ≤19 years  who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to hospital for any reason in Tshwane District during a 6-week period at the beginning of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. We used five data sources  which were:  1  COVID-19 line lists;  2  collated SARS-CoV-2 testing data;  3  SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data;  4  COVID-19 hospitalisation surveillance; and  5  clinical data of public sector COVID-19-associated hospitalisations among children aged 13 years and younger. FINDINGS: Between Oct 31 and Dec 11  2021  6287 children and adolescents in Tshwane District were recorded as having COVID-19. During this period  2550 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised  of whom 462  18%  were aged 19 years or younger. The number of paediatric cases was higher than in the three previous SARS-CoV-2 waves  uncharacteristically increasing ahead of adult hospitalisations. 75 viral samples from adults and children in the district were sequenced  of which 74  99%  were of the omicron variant. Detailed clinical notes were available for 138  75%  of 183 children aged ≤13 years with COVID-19 who were hospitalised. 87  63%  of 138 children were aged 0–4 years. In 61  44%  of 138 cases COVID-19 was the primary diagnosis  among whom symptoms included fever  37 [61%] of 61   cough  35 [57%]   shortness of breath  19 [31%]   seizures  19 [31%]   vomiting  16 [26%]   and diarrhoea  15 [25%] . Median length of hospital stay was 2 days [IQR 1–3] . 122  88%  of 138 children with available data needed standard ward care and 27  20%  needed oxygen therapy. Seven  5%  of 138 children were ventilated and four  3%  died during the study period  all related to complex underlying copathologies. All children and 77  92%  of 84 parents or guardians with available data were unvaccinated to COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Rapid increases in paediatric COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations mirror high community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in Tshwane District  South Africa. Continued monitoring is needed to understand the long-term effect of the omicron variant on children and adolescents.

These variants are getting challenging to contain from spreading worldwide. Because of these variants  the second wave has started in various countries and is threatening human civilization. Thus  we require efficient vaccines that can combat all emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore  we took the initiative to develop a peptide-based next-generation vaccine using four variants  Wuhan variant  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.1.28  that could potentially combat SARS-CoV-2 variants. We applied a series of computational tools  servers  and software to identify the most significant epitopes present on the mutagenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The immunoinformatics approaches were used to identify common B cell derived T cell epitopes  influencing the host immune system. Consequently  to develop a novel vaccine candidate  the antigenic epitopes were linked with a flexible and stable peptide linker  and the adjuvant was added at the N-terminal end. 3D vaccine candidate structure was refined  and quality was assessed using web servers. The physicochemical properties and safety parameters of the vaccine construct were assessed through bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The molecular docking analysis between TLR4 MD2 and the proposed vaccine candidate demonstrated a satisfactory interaction. The molecular dynamics studies confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidate. Finally  we optimized the proposed vaccine through codon optimization and in silico cloning to study the expression. Our multi-epitopic next-generation peptide vaccine construct can boost immunity against the Wuhan variant and all significant mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2.

A total of 4 977 sequences of the Gamma strain of SARS-CoV-2 from Brazil were analyzed. We detected 194 sites under positive selection in 12 genes ORFs: Spike  N  M  E  ORF1a  ORF1b  ORF3  ORF6  ORF7a  ORF7b  ORF8  and ORF10. Some diagnostic sites for Gamma lacked a signature of positive selection in our study  but these were not fixed  apparently escaping the action of purifying selection. Our network analyses revealed branches leading to expanding haplotypes with sites under selection only detected when P.1.1 and P.1.2 were considered. The P.1.2 exclusive haplotype H_5 originated from a non-synonymous mutational step  H3509Y  in H_1 of ORF1a. The selected allele  3509Y  represents an adaptive novelty involving ORF1a of P.1. Finally  we discuss how phenomena such as epistasis and antagonistic pleiotropy could limit the emergence of new alleles  and combinations thereof  in SARS-COV-2 lineages  maintaining infectivity in humans  while providing rapid response capabilities to face the arms race triggered by host immuneresponses.

Such variants have been reported from the UK  B.1.1.7   South Africa  B.1.351  and  Brazil  P.1 B.1.1.28 . We performed this study to track the importation  spread  and emergence of variants locally. Methods: We sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers  n=75  entering Karnataka  South India  between Dec 22  2020 and Jan 31  2021  and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru  n=108   between Nov 22  2020- Jan 22  2021  as well as a local outbreak. We present the lineage distribution and analysis of these sequences. Results: Genomes from the study group into 34 lineages. Variant B.1.1.7 was introduced by international travel  24 73  32.9% . Lineage B.1.36 and B.1 formed a major fraction of both imported  B.1.36: 20 73  27.4%; B.1: 14 73  19.2%   and circulating viruses  B.1.36: 45 103; 43.7% . B.1: 26 103; 25.2% . The lineage B.1.36 was also associated with a local outbreak. We detected nine amino acid changes  previously associated with immune escape  spread across multiple lineages. The N440K change was detected in 45 162  27.7%  of the sequences  37 of these were in the B.1.36 lineage  37 65  56.92%  Conclusions: Our data support the idea that variants of concern spread by travel. Viruses with amino acid replacements associated with immune escape are already circulating. It is critical to check transmission and monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 locally.

Relatively high vaccination rates have been achieved in most regions of the United States and several countries worldwide. However  access to vaccines in low- and mid-income countries  LMICs  is still suboptimal. Second generation vaccines that are universally affordable and induce systemic and mucosal immunity are needed. Here we performed an extended safety and immunogenicity analysis of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine consisting of a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a pre-fusion stabilized version of the spike protein  NDV-HXP-S  administered intranasally  IN   intramuscularly  IM   or IN followed by IM in Sprague Dawley rats. Local reactogenicity  systemic toxicity  and post-mortem histopathology were assessed after the vaccine administration  with no indication of severe local or systemic reactions. Immunogenicity studies showed that the three vaccination regimens tested elicited high antibody titers against the wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the NDV vector. Moreover  high antibody titers were induced against the spike of B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta  and B.1.617.2  delta  variants of concern  VOCs . Importantly  robust levels of serum antibodies with neutralizing activity against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 USA‐WA1 2020 isolate were detected after the boost. Overall  our study expands the pre-clinical safety and immunogenicity characterization of NDV-HXP-S and reinforces previous findings in other animal models about its high immunogenicity. Clinical testing of this vaccination approach is ongoing in different countries including Thailand  Vietnam  Brazil and Mexico.

A single missense mutation of U to G at nucleotide position 1355  U1355G  in the spike  S  gene changes leucine to arginine  L452R  in the spike protein. This mutation has been observed in the India and California strains  B.1.617 and B.1.427 B.1.429  respectively . Control of COVID-19 requires rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore  we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  assay plus a bioluminescent assay in real-time  BART  to detect SARS-CoV-2 and the L452R spike mutation. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was evaluated using synthetic RNAs including target sequences and RNA-spiked clinical nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens as well as reference strains representing five viral and four bacterial pathogens. The novel RT-LAMP-BART assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 was highly specific compared to the conventional real-time RT-PCR. Within 25 min  the RT-LAMP-BART assay detected 80 copies of the target gene in a sample  whereas the conventional real-time RT-PCR method detected 5 copies per reaction within 130 min. Using RNA-spiked specimens  the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was slightly attenuated compared to purified RNA as a template. The results were identical to those of the conventional real-time RT-PCR method. Furthermore  using a peptide nucleic acid  PNA  probe  the RT-LAMP-BART method correctly identified the L452R spike mutation. This is the first report describes RT-LAMP-BART as a simple  inexpensive  rapid  and useful assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2  its variants of concern  and for screening of COVID-19.

Omicron has numerous mutations with potential to increase transmissibility  confer resistance to therapeutics  or partially escape infection- or vaccine-induced immunity  2 . On November 26  WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern  3   as did the U.S. SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group  SIG * on November 30. On December 1  the first case of COVID-19 attributed to the Omicron variant was reported in the United States. As of December 8  a total of 22 states had identified at least one Omicron variant case  including some that indicate community transmission. Among 43 cases with initial follow-up  one hospitalization and no deaths were reported. This report summarizes U.S. surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants  characteristics of the initial persons investigated with COVID-19 attributed to the Omicron variant and public health measures implemented to slow the spread of Omicron in the United States. Implementation of concurrent prevention strategies  including vaccination  masking  increasing ventilation  testing  quarantine  and isolation  are recommended to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2  including variants such as Omicron  and to protect against severe illness and death from COVID-19.

METHODS: We collected 79 respiratory samples from 59 patients monitored in an outpatient center or in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital Regensburg. We analyzed viral load by quantitative real-time PCR  viral antigen by point-of-care assay  time since onset of symptoms and presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the context of virus isolation from respiratory specimen. RESULTS: The odds ratio for virus isolation increased 1.9-fold for each log 10  level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 7.4-fold with detection of viral antigen  while it decreased 6.3-fold beyond 10 days of symptoms and 20.0-fold with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The latter was confirmed for B.1.1.7 strains. The positive predictive value for virus isolation was 60.0% for viral loads above 10  7  RNA copies mL and 50.0% for the presence of viral antigen. Symptom onset before 10 days and seroconversion predicted lack of infectivity with 93.8% and 96.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support quarantining patients with high viral load and detection of viral antigen  and lifting restrictive measures with increasing time to symptom onset and seroconversion. Delay of antibody formation may prolong infectivity.

The aim of this study was to describe the development of sinus bradycardia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its association with outcome in outbreak due to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Lineage. We leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19  SPARCOL  study and identified patients who required admission to intensive care unit  ICU . Inclusion criteria were:  a  adult  ≥18 years old  patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19;  b  a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples; and  c  at least one blood sample collected at admission and stored for suPAR  hs-CRP  and ferritin testing. All patients had continuous heart rate monitoring during hospitalization. In total  81 patients were included. Of them  17  21%  and 64  79%  were intubated and admitted to the ICU during the first and second wave  respectively. Two  12%  and 62  97%  developed bradycardia before ICU admission  respectively  p < 0.001 . Patients with bradycardia had increased suPAR  p < 0.001  and hs-CRP level  p < 0.001 . Infusion of isoprenaline and or noradrenaline was necessary to maintain an adequate rate and peripheral perfusion in all patients. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with bradycardia  p < 0.001 . In conclusion  bradycardia was associated with poor outcome. As B.1.1.7 variant strain is spreading more rapidly in many countries  our findings help in the identification of patients who may require early admission to ICU.

We previously demonstrated that solid cancer and anti-cancer treatments may be associated with increased death following COVID-19 in an analysis of patients treated in our London hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  March to May 2020 . The United Kingdom experienced a second peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations during December 2020 to February 2021. We aimed to compare the outcomes between patients with solid cancer presenting to our hospital during the first and second peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine if cancer and anti-cancer treatments were still risk factors for death. We found lower overall deaths in our hospital during the second peak. Metastatic cancer and anti-cancer treatments were risk factors for worse outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with cancer. ABSTRACT: An increased mortality risk was observed in patients with cancer during the first wave of COVID-19. Here  we describe determinants of mortality in patients with solid cancer comparing the first and second waves of COVID-19. A retrospective analysis encompassing two waves of COVID-19  March–May 2020; December 2020–February 2021  was performed. 207 patients with cancer were matched to 452 patients without cancer. Patient demographics and oncological variables such as cancer subtype  staging and anti-cancer treatment were evaluated for association with COVID-19 mortality. Overall mortality was lower in wave two compared to wave one  HR 0.41  95% CI: 0.30–0.56 . In patients with cancer  mortality was 43.6% in wave one and 15.9% in wave two. In hospitalized patients  after adjusting for age  ethnicity and co-morbidities  a history of cancer was associated with increased mortality in wave one but not wave two. In summary  the second UK wave of COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients. A history of solid cancer was not associated with increased mortality despite the dominance of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. In both waves  metastatic disease and systemic anti-cancer treatment appeared to be independent risk factors for death within the combined cancer cohort.

Current literature is unclear on whether the Alpha variant is associated with increased severity. We linked clinical data with viral genome sequence data to compare admitted cases between SARS-CoV-2 waves in London and to investigate the association between the Alpha variant and the severity of disease. METHODS: Clinical  demographic  laboratory and viral sequence data from electronic health record systems were collected for all cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test between 13 March 2020 and 17 February 2021 in a multisite London healthcare institution. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression assessed risk factors for severity as defined by hypoxia at admission. RESULTS: There were 5810 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive cases of which 2341 were admitted  838 in wave 1 and 1503 in wave 2 . Both waves had a temporally aligned rise in nosocomial cases  96 in wave 1 and 137 in wave 2 . The Alpha variant was first identified on 15 November 2020 and increased rapidly to comprise 400 472  85%  of sequenced isolates from admitted cases in wave 2. A multivariate analysis identified risk factors for severity on admission  such as age  OR 1.02  95% CI 1.01 to 1.03  for every year older; p<0.001   obesity  OR 1.70  95% CI 1.28 to 2.26; p<0.001  and infection with the Alpha variant  OR 1.68  95% CI 1.26 to 2.24; p<0.001 . CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis is the first in hospitalised cohorts to show increased severity of disease associated with the Alpha variant. The number of nosocomial cases was similar in both waves despite the introduction of many infection control interventions before wave 2.

In this study  we investigated the effectiveness of these vaccines in a large  community-based survey of randomly selected households across the United Kingdom. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 against infections  new polymerase chain reaction  PCR -positive cases  with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the B.1.617.2 variant  absolute difference of 10–13% for BNT162b2 and 16% for ChAdOx1  compared to the B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant. The effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity after second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1  with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positive cases but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval  but protection was higher in vaccinated individuals after a prior infection and in younger adults. With B.1.617.2  infections occurring after two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden as those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections  but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with B.1.617.2.

New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VoC  are emerging all over the world  with the threat of being more readily transmitted  being more virulent  or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified  i.e. the United Kingdom  UK  B.1.1.7   South African  B.1.351  and Brazilian  B.1.1.28.1  variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC  no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by  i  histological scoring   ii  micro-computed tomography  and  iii  analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however  in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7  a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected. INTERPRETATION: We established relevant preclinical infection models that will be pivotal to assess the efficacy of current and future vaccine s   candidates  as well as therapeutics  small molecules and antibodies  against two important SARS-CoV-2 VoC. FUNDING: Stated in the acknowledgment.

Hospital staff was encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 when presenting with SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. In a period of approximately 5 months  a steady decline in the performance of the Ag test was noted  epidemiologically coinciding with the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  alpha  variant of concern  VOC  in the Netherlands. This led to the hypothesis that the diagnostic performance of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test was influenced by the infecting viral variant. The results show a significantly lower sensitivity of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test in persons infected with the B.1.1.7  alpha  variant of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that in persons infected with non-B.1.1.7 variants  also after adjustment for viral load. IMPORTANCE Antigen tests for COVID-19 are widely used for rapid identification of COVID-19 cases  for example  for access to schools  festivals  and travel. There are several FDA- and CE-cleared tests on the market. Their performance has been evaluated mainly on the basis of infections by the classical variant of the causing virus  SARS-CoV-2. This paper provides evidence that the performance of one of the most widely used antigen tests detects significantly fewer cases of COVID-19 by the alpha variant than by the classical variants of SARS-CoV-2. This means that the role of antigen tests needs to be reevaluated in regions where other variants of SARS-CoV-2 predominate.

In January 2021  we identified 21 cases of this variant in Corzano  defining the first outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Italy. The high transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant represented an important benefit for the virus  which became rapidly dominant on the territory. Containment measures induced the epidemic curve onto a decreasing trajectory underlining the importance of appropriate control and surveillance for restraint of virus spread. Highlights The first Italian outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 lineage occurred in Lombardy in January 2021. The outbreak originated by a single introduction of the B.1.1.7 lineage. The genomic sequencing revealed  for the first time  the presence of the V551F mutation in the B.1.1.7 lineage in Italy. Surveillance  prompt sequencing and tracing efforts were fundamental to identify and to quickly contain the outbreak.

The proximity of patients inside nursing homes allows investigate the dynamics of viral transmission  which may help understand SARS-Cov2 biology and spread. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes obtained from 46 patients infected in an outbreak inside a nursing home in Calabria region  South Italy  were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing. We also investigated the evolution of viral genomes in 8 patients for which multiple swabs were available. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype reconstruction were carried out with IQ-TREE software and RegressHaplo tool  respectively. RESULTS: All viral strains isolated from patients infected in the nursing home were classified as B.1 lineage  clade G. Overall  14 major single nucleotide variations  SNVs   frequency > 80%  and 12 minor SNVs  frequency comprised between 20% and 80%  were identified with reference to the Wuhan-H-1 sequence  NC_045512.2 . All patients presented the same 6 major SNVs: D614G in the S gene; P4715L  ntC3037T  F924F  and S5398P in Orf1ab gene; ntC26681T  F53F  in the M gene; and ntC241T in the non-coding UTR region. However  haplotype reconstruction identified a founder haplotype  Hap A  in 36 patients carrying only the 6 common SNVs indicated above  and 10 other haplotypes  Hap B—K  derived from Hap A in the remaining 10 patients. Notably  no significant association between a specific viral haplotype and clinical parameters was found. CONCLUSION: The predominant viral strain responsible for the infection in a nursing home in Calabria was the B.1 lineage  clade G . Viral genomes were classified into 11 haplotypes  Hap A in 36 patients  Hap B—K in the remaining patients .

While the original Omicron lineage  BA.1  has become dominant in many countries  BA.2 has been detected in at least 67 countries and has become dominant in the Philippines  India  and Denmark. Here  we evaluated the replicative ability and pathogenicity of an authentic infectious BA.2 isolate in immunocompetent and human ACE2  hACE2 -expressing mice and hamsters. In contrast to recent data with chimeric  recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strains expressing the spike proteins of BA.1 and BA.2 on an ancestral WK-521 backbone3  we observed similar infectivity and pathogenicity in mice and hamsters between BA.2 and BA.1  and less pathogenicity compared to early SARS-CoV-2 strains. We also observed a marked and significant reduction in the neutralizing activity of plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and vaccine recipients against BA.2 compared to ancestral and Delta variant strains. In addition  we found that some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies  REGN10987 REGN10933  COV2-2196 COV2-2130  and S309  and antiviral drugs  molnupiravir  nirmatrelvir  and S-217622  can restrict viral infection in the respiratory organs of hamsters infected with BA.2. These findings suggest that the replication and pathogenicity of BA.2 is comparable to that of BA.1 in rodents and that several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antiviral compounds are effective against Omicron BA.2 variants.

Systematic analysis of such antibodies and their combinations can be particularly instrumental for identification of candidates that may prove resistant to the emerging viral escape variants. Here  we isolated a panel of 23 RBD-specific human monoclonal antibodies from the B cells of convalescent patients. A surprisingly large proportion of such antibodies displayed potent virus-neutralizing activity both in vitro and in vivo. Four of the isolated nAbs can be categorized as ultrapotent with an apparent IC 100  below 16 ng mL. We show that individual nAbs as well as dual combinations thereof retain activity against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  such as B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617  and C.37   as well as against other viral variants. When used as a prophylactics or therapeutics  these nAbs could potently suppress viral replication and prevent lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Our data contribute to the rational development of oligoclonal therapeutic nAb cocktails mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 escape.

Many studies have examined Ab responses in the blood from vaccinated and infected individuals. However  since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus  it is also critical to understand the mucosal Ab responses at the sites of initial virus exposure. Here  we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients. Although saliva levels were significantly lower  a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested. Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma  while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva. Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied. Neutralization titers against the initial WA1  D614G   B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.617.2  delta  strains were similar but lower against the B.1.351  beta  strain. Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  ADCP  activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers. Interestingly  while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable  enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals. Altogether  this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly  although Ig isotypic differences were noted. The induced plasma Abs displayed Fab-mediated and Fc-dependent functions with comparable neutralization and ADCP potencies  but a greater capacity to activate complement was elicited upon vaccination.

The emergence of variants of concern  VOC  that are more transmissible than the previous circulating ones has raised particular concerns on the vaccines effectiveness and reinfection rates. The P.1 lineage was first identified in December 2020 in Manaus city and is now globally spread. We report the first case of reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 caused by the P.1 variant outside of Manaus. The potential of these new variants to escape naturally and vaccine- induced immunity highlights the need for a global vigilance.

SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis is an important tool for effective real-time quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  diagnostics  epidemiology monitoring  as well as vaccination strategy. To date  there is no comprehensive report on the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genome variants in either the Czech Republic  including Central and Eastern Europe in general  during the first year of pandemic. In this study  we have analysed a representative cohort of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 229 nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 positive patients collected between March 2020 and February 2021 using validated reference-based sequencing workflow. We document the changing frequency of dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2  from B.1 -> B.1.1.266 -> B.1.258 -> B.1.1.7  throughout the first year of the pandemic and list specific variants that could impact the diagnostic efficiency RT-qPCR assays. Moreover  our reference-based workflow provided evidence of superinfection in several samples  which may have contributed to one of the highest per capita numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the first year of the pandemic in the Czech Republic.

Using protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation  we examined the interactions of five SARS-CoV-2 variations’ receptor-binding domains with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  receptor in host cells. A comparison of protein-protein docking and dynamics simulations showed that these point mutations significantly altered the structural behavior of the spike  S  protein  affecting RBD binding to hACE2 at the respective sites. Further research is needed to determine whether these changes affect drug–S protein binding and its potential therapeutic impact. ABSTRACT: Since the beginning of the coronavirus 19  COVID-19  pandemic in late 2019  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has been evolving through the acquisition of genomic mutations  leading to the emergence of multiple variants of concern  VOCs  and variants of interest  VOIs . Currently  four VOCs  Alpha  Beta  Delta  and Gamma  and seven VOIs  Epsilon  Zeta  Eta  Theta  Iota  Kappa  and Lambda  of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in worldwide circulation. Here  we investigated the interactions of the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of five SARS-CoV-2 variants with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  receptor in host cells  to determine the extent of molecular divergence and the impact of mutation  using protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation approaches. Along with the wild-type  WT  SARS-CoV-2  this study included the Brazilian  BR lineage P.1 Gamma   Indian  IN lineage B.1.617 Delta   South African  SA lineage B.1.351 Beta   United Kingdom  UK lineage B.1.1.7 Alpha   and United States  US lineage B.1.429 Epsilon  variants. The protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation studies revealed that these point mutations considerably affected the structural behavior of the spike  S  protein compared to the WT  which also affected the binding of RBD with hACE2 at the respective sites. Additional experimental studies are required to determine whether these effects have an influence on drug–S protein binding and its potential therapeutic effect.

This study aimed to predict molecular dynamics change of emerging variants in the spike protein. In this study  several structural biology tools  such as SuperPose  were utilized to study spike protein structures' thermodynamics  superimposition  and the spike protein disulphide bonds. This questions the current vaccines efficacies that were based on the Nextstrain clade 19A that first documented in Wuhan and lacks any variants. The prediction results of this study have exhibited the stabilizing role of the globally dominant variant  the D614G; clade 20A  and other variants in addition to their role in increasing the flexibility of the spike protein of the virus. The SuperPose findings have revealed a conformational change impact of D614G in allowing the polybasic Furin cleavage site   682 RRAR↓S 686   to be closer to the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and hence more exposed to cleavage. The presence of D614G in any clade or subclade  such as 20A  B.1.1.7  20I 501Y.V1  or Alpha  B.1.351  20H 501Y.V2  or Beta  P.1  20J 501Y.V3  or Gamma  B.1.617.2  21A 478K.V1  or Delta  has increased its stability and flexibility and unified the superimposition among all clades which might impact the virus ability to escape the antibodies neutralization by changing the antigenicity drift of the protein three-dimensional  3D  structure from the wild type clade 19A; this is in agreement with previous study. In conclusion  a new design for the current vaccines to include at least the mutation D614G is immediately needed.

Residues E484 and K417 in the receptor-binding site  RBS  are both mutated in lineages first described in South Africa  B.1.351  and Brazil  B.1.1.28.1 . The nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 patients are preferentially encoded by certain heavy-chain germline genes and the two most frequently elicited antibody families  IGHV3–53 3–66 and IGHV1–2  can each bind the RBS in two different binding modes. However  their binding and neutralization are abrogated by either the E484K or K417N mutation  whereas nAbs to the cross-reactive CR3022 and S309 sites are largely unaffected. This structural and functional analysis illustrates why mutations at E484 and K417 adversely affect major classes of nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 with consequences for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

We demonstrate how the dose and number of immunizations influence protection. Nonhuman primates  NHP  received two doses of 30 or 100 μg of Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine  a single immunization of 30 μg  or no vaccine. Two doses of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 induced reciprocal ID 50  mean neutralizing antibody titers against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 of 3 300 and 240  respectively. Higher neutralizing responses against B.1.617.2 were also observed after two doses compared to a single dose. Following challenge with B.1.351  there was ~4–5−log 10  reduction of viral subgenomic RNA  sgRNA  and low to undetectable replication in bronchoalveolar lavages in the two-dose vaccine groups  with a 1−log 10  reduction in nasal swabs  NS  in the 100 μg dose group. These data establish that a two-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 will be critical for providing upper and lower airway protection against major variants of concern.

Despite their efficacy in clinical trials  data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here  we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies  particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain  RBD  were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose  though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals  antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however  there was no increase in circulating antibodies  neutralizing titers  or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals  identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together  our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure  whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.

Characterizing the cross-reactivity of antibodies against these VOCs is necessary to understand the humoral response of non-hospitalized individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2  a population that remains understudied. Thirty-two SARS-CoV-2-positive  PCR-confirmed  and non-hospitalized Canadian adults were enrolled 14–21 days post-diagnosis in 2020  before the emergence of the B.1.351  also known as Beta   B.1.617.2  Delta  and P.1  Gamma  VOCs. Sera were collected 4 and 16 weeks post-diagnosis. Antibody levels and pseudo-neutralization of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein human ACE-2 receptor interaction were analyzed with native  B.1.351  B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins. Despite a lower response observed for the variant spike proteins  we report evidence of a sustained humoral response against native  B.1.351  B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins among non-hospitalized Canadian adults. Furthermore  this response inhibited the interaction between the spike proteins from the different VOCs and ACE-2 receptor for ≥ 16 weeks post-diagnosis  except for individuals aged 18–49 years who showed no inhibition of the interaction between B.1.617.1 or B.1.617.2 spike and ACE-2. Interestingly  the affinity  K D   measured between the spike proteins  native  B.1.351  B.1.617.2 and P.1  and antibodies elicited in sera of infected and vaccinated  BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  individuals was invariant. Relative to sera from vaccine-naïve  and previously infected  individuals  sera from vaccinated individuals had higher antibody levels  as measured with label-free SPR  and more efficiently inhibited the spike–ACE-2 interactions  even among individuals aged 18–49 years  showing the effectiveness of vaccination.

Little is known about variant B.1.1.519 with spike mutation T478K  dominant in Mexico. We describe a linked SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.519 outbreak in three IDD facilities in the Netherlands. METHODS: Following notification of the index  subsequent cases were identified through serial PCR group testing. Positive specimens were submitted for whole-genome-sequencing. Clinical information was gathered through interviews with staff members of the three facilities. RESULTS: Attack rate  AR  in clients of the index facility was 92%  23 25   total AR in clients 45%  33 73  and in staff members 24%  8 34 . 55%  18 33  of client cases were asymptomatic  versus 25%  2 8  of staff members. Five client cases  15%  were hospitalized  two died  6% . Sequencing yielded the same specific B.1.1.519 genotype in all three facilities. No significant difference in median viral load was established comparing the B.1.1.519 variant with other circulating variants. The index of the linked outbreak reported no travel history or link to suspected or confirmed cases suggesting regional surveillance. Observed peak regional prevalence of B.1.1.519 during the outbreak supports this. CONCLUSION: AR  morbidity and mortality prior to control measures taking effect were high  probably related to the specific characteristics of the IDD setting and its clients. We assessed no evidence for intrinsic contributing properties of variant B.1.1.519. Our study argues for enhanced infection prevention protocols in the IDD setting  and prioritization of this group for vaccination against COVID-19.

These have exacerbated the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 -induced global health threats and hindered COVID-19 vaccine development and therapeutic progress. This commentary discusses the potential risk of the newly classified Mu variant of interest  seeming a highly vaccine-resistant variant  and the approaches that can be adopted to tackle this variant based on the available evidence. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.621  Mu variant  lineage has shown approximately ten times higher resistance to neutralizing sera obtained from COVID-19 survivors or BNT161b2-vaccinated people than the parenteral B.1 lineage. Several urgent and long-term strategic plans  including quick genomic surveillance for uncovering the genetic characteristics of the variants  equitable global mass vaccination  booster dose administration if required  and strict implementation of public health measures or non-pharmaceutical interventions  must be undertaken concertedly to restrict further infections  mutations  or recombination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its deadly strains.

Whole-genome sequencing  WGS  is being used as a potential approach to investigate genomic evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  virus. In this study  a total of 87 SARS-CoV-2 genomes−49 genomes from the first wave  March 2020 to February 2021  and 38 genomes from the second wave  March 2021 to July 2021  from Eastern Uttar Pradesh  E-UP  were sequenced and analyzed to understand its evolutionary pattern and variants against publicaly available sequences. The complete genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave in E-UP largely reported transmission of G  GR  and GH clades with specific mutations. In contrast  variants of concerns  VOCs  such as Delta  71.0%  followed by Delta AY.1  21.05%  and Kappa  7.9%  lineages belong to G clade with prominent signature amino acids were introduced in the second wave. Signature substitution at positions S:L452R  S:P681R  and S:D614G were commonly detected in the Delta  Delta AY.1  and Kappa variants whereas S:T19R and S:T478K were confined to Delta and Delta AY.1 variants only. Vaccine breakthrough infections showed unique mutational changes at position S:D574Y in the case of the Delta variant  whereas position S:T95 was conserved among Kappa variants compared to the Wuhan isolate. During the transition from the first to second waves  a shift in the predominant clade from GH to G clade was observed. The identified spike protein mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be used as the potential target for vaccine and drug development to combat the effects of the COVID-19 disease.

We further generated an engineered bivalent nanobody construct engineered by a flexible linker  and a dimeric Fc conjugated nanobody construct.

To aid these studies  based on the wealth of available structural information about several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Protein Data Bank  PDB  and a modeling pipeline we have previously developed for tracking the ongoing global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins  we provide a set of computed structural models  henceforth models  of the Omicron VOC receptor-binding domain  omRBD  bound to its corresponding receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme  ACE2  and a variety of therapeutic entities  including neutralizing and therapeutic antibodies targeting previously-detected viral strains. We generated bound omRBD models using both experimentally-determined structures in the PDB as well as machine learning-based structure predictions as starting points. Examination of ACE2-bound omRBD models reveals an interdigitated multi-residue interaction network formed by omRBD-specific substituted residues  R493  S496  Y501  R498  and ACE2 residues at the interface  which was not present in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. Emergence of this interaction network suggests optimization of a key region of the binding interface  and positive cooperativity among various sites of residue substitutions in omRBD mediating ACE2 binding. Examination of neutralizing antibody complexes for Barnes Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies modeled with omRBD highlights an overall loss of interfacial interactions  with gain of new interactions in rare cases  mediated by substituted residues. Many of these substitutions have previously been found to independently dampen or even ablate antibody binding  and perhaps mediate antibody-mediated neutralization escape  e.g.  K417N . We observe little compensation of corresponding interaction loss at interfaces when potential escape substitutions occur in combination. A few selected antibodies  e.g.  Barnes Class 3 S309   however  feature largely unaltered or modestly affected protein-protein interfaces. While we stress that only qualitative insights can be obtained directly from our models at this time  we anticipate that they can provide starting points for more detailed and quantitative computational characterization  and  if needed  redesign of monoclonal antibodies for targeting the Omicron VOC Spike protein. In the broader context  the computational pipeline we developed provides a framework for rapidly and efficiently generating retrospective and prospective models for other novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 bound to entities of virological and therapeutic interest  in the setting of a global pandemic.

Accordingly  antiviral interventions that are resistant to further virus evolution are needed. The host-derived cytokine IFN-λ has been proposed as a possible treatment based on correlative studies in human COVID-19 patients. Here  we show IFN-λ protects against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.1.529  Omicron  variants in three strains of conventional and human ACE2 transgenic mice. Prophylaxis or therapy with nasally-delivered IFN-λ2 limited infection of historical or variant  B.1.351 and B.1.1.529  SARS-CoV-2 strains in the upper and lower respiratory tracts without causing excessive inflammation. In the lung  IFN-λ was produced preferentially in epithelial cells and acted on radio-resistant cells to protect against of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus  inhaled IFN-λ may have promise as a treatment for evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants that develop resistance to antibody-based countermeasures.

In vitro  we show that whilst ΔH69 V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism  it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69 V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of S proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation. In addition  replacement of H69 and V70 residues in B.1.1.7 spike  where ΔH69 V70 naturally occurs  impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus. B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild type Wuhan-1 D614G  dependent on ΔH69 V70. Therefore  as ΔH69 V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity  continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.

Recently  the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the prevalence of the virus in the community. Here  we propose a novel methodology  called lineagespot  for the monitoring of mutations and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next-generation sequencing  NGS . Our proposed method was tested and evaluated using NGS data produced by the sequencing of 14 wastewater samples from the municipality of Thessaloniki  Greece  covering a 6-month period. The results showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater data. lineagespot was able to record the evolution and rapid domination of the Alpha variant  B.1.1.7  in the community  and allowed the correlation between the mutations evident through our approach and the mutations observed in patients from the same area and time periods. lineagespot is an open-source tool  implemented in R  and is freely available on GitHub and registered on bio.tools.

This variant has an unusually large number of mutations  with 10 amino acid changes in the spike  S  protein  raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. In this study  we tested SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the messenger RNA–based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 lineage pseudovirus. These data indicate that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.

Yet  available literature is scarce. Covidiagnostix is a multicenter study designed to assess the antibody response in >1000 healthcare professionals  HCPs  who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Methods: Serum was tested at time-0  T 0    before the first dose  T 1   T 2   and T 3   respectively  21  42  and 180 days after T 0 . Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-protein were measured to assess SARS-CoV-2 infections  whereas antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were measured to assess the vaccine response. Neutralization activity against the D614G  B.1.1.7  and B.1.351 variants were also analyzed. Results: Six months post-vaccination HCPs showed an antibody titer decrease of approximately 70%  yet  the titer was still one order of magnitude higher than that of seropositive individuals before vaccination. We identified 12 post-vaccination infected HCPs. None showed severe symptoms. Interestingly  most of them showed titers at T 2  above the neutralization thresholds obtained from the neutralization activity experiments. Conclusion: Vaccination induces a humoral response which is well detectable even six months post-vaccination. Vaccination prevents severe COVID-19 cases  yet post-vaccination infection is possible even in the presence of a high anti-S serum antibody titer.

Henceforth  the current study envisions the analysis of predictive models that employ machine learning techniques and mathematical modeling to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. A systematic literature review  SLR  has been conducted  wherein a search into different databases  viz.  PubMed and IEEE Explore  fetched 1178 records initially. From an initial of 1178 records  only 50 articles were analyzed completely. Around  64%  of the studies employed data-driven mathematical models  whereas only  26%  used machine learning models. Hybrid and ARIMA models constituted about  5%  and  3%  of the selected articles. Various Quality Evaluation Metrics  QEM   including accuracy  precision  specificity  sensitivity  Brier-score  F1-score  RMSE  AUC  and prediction and validation cohort  were used to gauge the effectiveness of the studied models. The study also considered the impact of Pfizer-BioNTech  BNT162b2   AstraZeneca  ChAd0x1   and Moderna  mRNA-1273  on Beta  B.1.1.7  and Delta  B.1.617.2  viral variants and the impact of administering booster doses given the evolution of viral variants of the virus.

In early January 2021  a novel variant of concern  VOC  designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages  B.1.427 and B.1.429  was originally detected in California  CA  and shown to enhance infectivity in vitro and decrease antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence  transmissibility  and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both strains exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1  614G   with B.1.429 causing the most body weight loss among all 3 lineages. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1.  614G  and B.1.427 infections. In addition  subgenomic viral RNA  sgRNA  levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429  however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three strains. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1  614G  or B.1.427 in the upper respiratory tract  URT  but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments  we found that epsilon  B.1.427 B.1.429  and gamma  P.1  dramatically outcompete alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351  and zeta  P.2  in the lungs. In the URT gamma  and epsilon dominate  but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427  B.1.429 and ancestral B.1  614G  variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative fitness of the epsilon  B.1.427 B.1.429  variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1  614G  strain.

Typical symptoms of patient having COVID-19 are fever  runny nose  cough  dry or not  and dyspnea. Several vaccines are available in markets that are tackling current pandemic. Many different strains of SAR-CoV-2 have been evolved with the passage of time. The emergence of VOCs particularly the B.1.351  “South African”  variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be more resistant than other SARS-CoV-2 strains to the current vaccines. Thus  the current research is focused to design multi-epitope subunit Vaccine  MEV  using structural vaccinology techniques. As a result  the designed MEV exhibit antigenic properties and possess therapeutic features that can trigger an immunological response against COVID-19. Furthermore  validation of the MEV using immune simulation and in silico cloning revealed that the proposed vaccine candidate effectively triggered the immune response. Conclusively  the developed MEV needs further wet lab exploration and could be a viable vaccine to manage and prevent COVID-19.

Lineage B.1.1.7  the Alpha variant  became dominant in early 2021  but the association between transmissibility and risk factors  such as age of primary case and viral load remains poorly understood. Here  we used comprehensive administrative data from Denmark  comprising the full population  January 11 to February 7  2021   to estimate household transmissibility. This study included 5 241 households with primary cases; 808 were infected with lineage B.1.1.7 and 4 433 with other lineages. Here  we report an attack rate of 38% in households with a primary case infected with B.1.1.7 and 27% in households with other lineages. Primary cases infected with B.1.1.7 had an increased transmissibility of 1.5–1.7 times that of primary cases infected with other lineages. The increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 was multiplicative across age and viral load.

Investigations that evaluate possible risk factors for infection  clinical manifestations  and viral shedding in different specimens also need to clarify possible associations with COVID-19 prognosis and disease outcomes. Study design In this study  we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 positivity and estimated viral loads by real-time RT-PCR in stool  sera  and urine samples from 35 patients  with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecular test in respiratory sample  attended at a University COVID-19 referral hospital in Goiania  Goias  Brazil. Whole-genome sequencing was also performed in samples with higher viral load. Results The positivity index was 51.43%  14.28%  and 5.71% in stool  sera  and urine specimens  respectively. The median viral load was 8.01 × 106 GC g  2.03 × 106 GC mL  and 1.36 × 105 GC mL in stool  sera  and urine  respectivelly. Of all patients  88.57% had previous comorbidities  and 48.39% of them had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in at least one type of clinical specimen evaluated by this study  stool  sera or urine . A higher viral load was observed in patients with more than two previous comorbidities and that were classified as severe or critical conditions. Samples with the highest viral loads were sequenced and characterized as B.1.1.33 variant. Conclusion We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in more than one type of clinical specimen during the infection  and that the most critical patients had detectable viral RNA in more than one clinical specimen at the same time point.

In this study  we assess the roadmap  the impact of the delta  B.1.617.2  variant of SARS-CoV-2  and potential future epidemic trajectories. METHODS: This mathematical modelling study was done to assess the UK Government's four-step process to easing lockdown restrictions in England  UK. We extended a previously described model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to incorporate vaccination and multi-strain dynamics to explicitly capture the emergence of the delta variant. We calibrated the model to English surveillance data  including hospital admissions  hospital occupancy  seroprevalence data  and population-level PCR testing data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework  then modelled the potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for relaxing NPIs. We estimated the resulting number of daily infections and hospital admissions  and daily and cumulative deaths. Three scenarios spanning a range of optimistic to pessimistic vaccine effectiveness  waning natural immunity  and cross-protection from previous infections were investigated. We also considered three levels of mixing after the lifting of restrictions. FINDINGS: The roadmap policy was successful in offsetting the increased transmission resulting from lifting NPIs starting on March 8  2021  with increasing population immunity through vaccination. However  because of the emergence of the delta variant  with an estimated transmission advantage of 76%  95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69–83  over alpha  fully lifting NPIs on June 21  2021  as originally planned might have led to 3900  95% CrI 1500–5700  peak daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario. Delaying until July 19  2021  reduced peak hospital admissions by three fold to 1400  95% CrI 700–1700  per day. There was substantial uncertainty in the epidemic trajectory  with particular sensitivity to the transmissibility of delta  level of mixing  and estimates of vaccine effectiveness. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID-19 hospital admissions resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. However  with the delta variant  it might not be possible to fully lift NPIs without a third wave of hospital admissions and deaths  even if vaccination coverage is high. Variants of concern  their transmissibility  vaccine uptake  and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic control measures.

It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected  because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain  compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna  mRNA-1273  or Pfizer BioNTech  BNT162b2  COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly  we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall  the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Here  we investigated SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in dogs and cats during COVID‐19 quarantine at private veterinary hospitals in Thailand. From April to May 2021  we detected SARS‐CoV‐2 in three out of 35 dogs and one out of nine cats from four out of 17 households with confirmed COVID‐19 patients. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was detected from one of the nasal  oral  rectal and environmental swabs of dog‐A  15 years old  mixed breed  male dog   cat‐B  1 year old  domestic shorthair  male cat   dog‐C  2 years old  mixed breed  female dog  and dog‐D  4 years old  Pomeranian  female dog . The animals tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA from 4 to 30 days after pet owners were confirmed to be COVID‐19 positive. The animals consecutively tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA for 4 to 10 days. One dog  dog‐A  showed mild clinical signs  while the other dogs and a cat remained asymptomatic during quarantine at the hospitals. SARS‐CoV‐2 specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in both the dogs and cat by surrogate virus neutralization tests. Phylogenetic and genomic mutation analyses of whole genome sequences of three SARS‐CoV‐2 strains from the dogs and cat revealed SARS‐CoV‐2 of the Alpha variant  B.1.1.7 lineage . Our findings are suggestive of human‐to‐animal transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 in COVID‐19‐positive households and contamination of viral RNA in the environment. Public awareness of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in pet dogs and cats in close contact with COVID‐19 patients should be raised.

RESULTS: Maximum anti-RBD IgG levels were similar in Covid - 19‑recovered individuals 8‒10 days after single-dose vaccination and in Covid-19-naïve subjects 7 days after 2 nd  vaccine dosing; both groups had ≈2‑fold higher anti-RBD IgG levels than Unvaccinated Covid-19 subjects tracked through 2 weeks post-symptom onset. Anti-S IgG expression patterns were similar to RBD within each group  but with lower signal strengths. Viral antigen-specific IgA and IgM levels were more variable than IgG patterns. Anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulins were not detected in Covid-19-naïve subjects. Neutralizing activity against the B.1 strain  and Gamma P.1 and Delta B.1.617.2 variants  was highest in Covid‑19-recovered single-dose vaccinated subjects; although neutralization against the Delta variant in this group was only 26% compared to B.1 neutralization  absolute anti-Delta titers suggested maintained protection. Neutralizing titers against the Gamma and Delta variants were 33‒77% and 26‒67%  respectively  versus neutralization against the B.1 strain  100%  in the three groups. CONCLUSION: These findings support SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine usefulness regardless of Covid-19 history  and confirm remarkable protection provided by a single vaccine dose in people who have recovered from Covid-19.

Monoclonal antibodies have shown promising results in patients. Here  we evaluate the in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic effect of COVA1-18  a neutralizing antibody highly potent against the B.1.1.7 isolate. In both prophylactic and therapeutic settings  SARS-CoV-2 remains undetectable in the lungs of treated hACE2 mice. Therapeutic treatment also causes a reduction in viral loads in the lungs of Syrian hamsters. When administered at 10 mg kg-1 one day prior to a high dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in cynomolgus macaques  COVA1-18 shows very strong antiviral activity in the upper respiratory compartments. Using a mathematical model  we estimate that COVA1-18 reduces viral infectivity by more than 95% in these compartments  preventing lymphopenia and extensive lung lesions. Our findings demonstrate that COVA1-18 has a strong antiviral activity in three preclinical models and could be a valuable candidate for further clinical evaluation.

However  ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike  the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants  we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus  5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations  including K417N T  E484K  and N501Y  were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV  suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain  these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.

The rapidly spreading B.1.617 lineage harbors two key mutations—L452R and E484Q—in the receptor binding domain  RBD  of its spike  S  protein. To understand the impact and structural dynamics of the variations in the interface of S protein and its host factor  the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2   triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed using single  E484Q or L452R  and double  E484Q + L452R  mutant structures and compared to wild type simulations. Our results indicate that the E484Q mutation disrupts the conserved salt bridge formed between Lys31 of hACE2 and Glu484 of S protein. Additionally  E484Q  which could favor the up conformation of the RBD  may help in enhanced hACE2 binding and immune escape. L452R introduces a charged patch near the binding surface that permits increased electrostatic attraction between the proteins. An improved network of intramolecular interactions observed is likely to increase the stability of the S protein and conformational changes may prevent the binding of neutralizing antibodies. The results obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that structural and dynamic changes introduced by these variations enhance the affinity of the viral S protein to hACE2 and could form the basis for further studies.

Although canine susceptibility is generally considered low  their role in the COVID-19 disease cycle remains unknown. In this study  we detected and sequenced a delta variant  AY.3  from a 12-year-old Collie living with owners that previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear if the dogs’ symptoms were related to SARS-CoV-2 infection or underlying conditions. The whole genome sequence obtained from the dog sample had several unique consensus level changes not previously identified in a SARS-CoV-2 genome that may play a role in the rapid adaptation from humans to dogs. Within the spike coding region  5 7 of the subconsensus variants identified in the dog sequence were also identified in the closest in-house human reference case. Taken together  the whole genome sequence  and phylogenetic and subconsensus variant analyses indicate the virus infecting the animal originated from a local outbreak cluster. The results of these analyses emphasize the importance of rapid detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in companion animals.

We constructed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  CoVac501  which is a self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with Toll-like receptor 7  TLR7  agonists. The vaccine contains immunodominant peptides screened from the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and is fully chemically synthesized. It has been formulated in an optimized nanoemulsion formulation and is stable at 40 °C for 1 month. In non-human primates  NHPs   CoVac501 elicited high and persistent titers of protective neutralizing antibodies against multiple RBD mutations  SARS-CoV-2 original strain  and variants  B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 . Specific peptides booster immunization against the B.1.351 variant has also been shown to be effective in improving protection against B.1.351. Meanwhile  CoVac501 elicited the increase of memory T cells  antigen-specific CD8 +  T-cell responses  and Th1-biased CD4 +  T-cell immune responses in NHPs. Notably  at an extremely high SARS-CoV-2 challenge dose of 1 × 10 7  TCID 50   CoVac501 provided near-complete protection for the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cynomolgus macaques.

Since its discovery in 2019  several circulating variants have emerged and some of them are associated with increased infections and death rate. Despite the genetic differences among these variants  vaccines approved for human use have shown a good immunogenic and protective response against them. In Chile  over 70% of the vaccinated population is immunized with CoronaVac  an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The immune response elicited by this vaccine has been described against the first SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from Wuhan  China and the D614G strain  lineage B . To date  four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern described have circulated worldwide. Here  we describe the neutralizing capacities of antibodies secreted by volunteers in the Chilean population immunized with CoronaVac against variants of concern Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351  Gamma  P.1  and Delta  B.617.2 . METHODS: Volunteers enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial were vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac in 0-14 or 0-28 immunization schedules. Sera samples were used to evaluate the capacity of antibodies induced by the vaccine to block the binding between Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  from variants of concern and the human ACE2 receptor by an in-house ELISA. Further  conventional microneutralization assays were used to test neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover  interferon-γ-secreting T cells against Spike from variants of concern were evaluated in PBMCs from vaccinated subjects using ELISPOT. RESULTS: CoronaVac promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block the RBD of all the SARS-CoV-2 variants studied. Seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies in the population evaluated were over 97% for the lineage B strain  over 80% for Alpha and Gamma variants  over 75% for Delta variant and over 60% for the Beta variant. Geometric means titers of blocking antibodies were reduced when tested against SARS-CoV-2 variants as compared to ancestral strain. We also observed that antibodies from vaccinated subjects were able to neutralize the infection of variants D614G  Alpha  Gamma and Delta in a conventional microneutralization assay. Importantly  after SARS-CoV-2 infection  we observed that the blocking capacity of antibodies from vaccinated volunteers increased up to ten times for all the variants tested. We compared the number of interferon-γ-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 Spike WT and variants of concern from vaccinated subjects and we did not detect significant differences. CONCLUSION: Immunization with CoronaVac in either immunization schedule promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and partially neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition  it stimulates cellular responses against all variants of concern.

Here  we studied neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 D614G  wildtype  WT   and the B.1.351  Beta   B.1.617.2  Delta   and B.1.1.529  Omicron  variants of concern  VOC  in a cohort of 60 health care workers after immunization with ChAdOx-1 S  Ad26.COV2.S  mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. High binding antibody levels against WT SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  were detected 28 days after vaccination with both mRNA vaccines  mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2   which significantly decreased after 6 months. In contrast  antibody levels were lower after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination but did not wane. Neutralization assays with infectious virus showed consistent cross-neutralization of the Beta and Delta variants  but neutralization of Omicron was significantly lower or absent  up to a 34-fold decrease compared to WT . Notably  BNT162b2 booster vaccination after either two mRNA-1273 immunizations or Ad26.COV.2 priming partially restored neutralization of the Omicron variant  but responses were still up to-17-fold decreased compared to WT. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells were detected up to 6 months after all vaccination regimens  with more consistent detection of specific CD4+ than CD8+ T-cells. No significant differences were detected between WT- and variant-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell responses  including Omicron  indicating minimal escape at the T-cell level. This study shows that vaccinated individuals retain T-cell immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant  potentially balancing the lack of neutralizing antibodies in preventing or limiting severe COVID-19. Booster vaccinations are needed to further restore Omicron cross-neutralization by antibodies.

We characterized COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated persons with an outcome of death. METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19 cases voluntarily reported to CDC by US health departments during January 1  2021–April 30  2021. We included cases among U.S. residents with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test ≥14 days after completion of an authorized primary vaccine series and who had a known outcome  alive or death  as of May 31  2021. When available  specimens were sequenced for viral lineage and death certificates were reviewed for cause s  of death. RESULTS: Of 8 084 reported COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated persons during the surveillance period  245  3.0%  died. Compared with patients who remained alive  those who died were older  median age 82 years vs. 57 years  P <0.01   more likely to reside in a long-term care facility  51% vs. 18%  P <0.01   and more likely to have at least one underlying health condition associated with risk for severe disease  64% vs. 24%  P <0.01 . Among 245 deaths  191  78%  were classified as COVID-19-related. Of 106 deaths with available death certificates  COVID-19 was listed on 81  77% . There were no differences in the type of vaccine administered or the most common viral lineage  B.1.1.7 . CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 deaths are rare in fully vaccinated persons  occurring most commonly in those with risk factors for severe disease  including older age and underlying health conditions. All eligible persons should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and follow other prevention measures to mitigate exposure risk.

However  breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals have been reported. Meanwhile  multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged worldwide  including the B.1.427 B.1.429 variant first described in California. Little is known about the real-world effectiveness of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against novel variants including B.1.427 B.1.429. METHODS: In this quality improvement project  post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases  PVSCs  were defined as individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test  NAAT  after receiving at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Chart extraction of demographic and clinical information was performed  and available specimens meeting cycle threshold value criteria were tested for L452R  N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR. RESULTS: From December 2020 to March 2021  189 PVSCs were identified out of 22 729 healthcare personnel who received at least one dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Of these  114  60.3%  occurred within 14 days of first vaccine dose  early post-vaccination   49  25.9%  within 14 days of the second vaccine dose  partially vaccinated   and 26  13.8%  ≥14 days after the second dose  fully vaccinated . Of 115 samples available for mutation testing  42 were positive for L452R alone  presumptive of B.1.427 B.1.429; three had N501Y mutation alone and none were found with E484K mutation. Though on univariate analysis partially- and fully-vaccinated PVSCs were more likely than early post-vaccination PVSCs to be infected with presumptive B.1.427 B.1.429  when adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427 B.1.429 at the time of infection  partially- and fully-vaccinated PVSC did not have statistically significantly elevated risk ratios for infection with this variant  RR 1.40  95% CI 0.81-2.43 and RR 1.13  95% CI 0.59-2.16  respectively . CONCLUSIONS: The great majority of PVSCs occurred prior to the expected onset of full  vaccine-derived immunity. Although the B.1.427 B.1.429 variant did not represent a significantly higher proportion of PVSCs than expected  numbers were small and there was a trend towards higher representation in the partially- and fully-vaccinated subset. Continued infection control measures in the workplace and in the community including social distancing and masking  particularly in the early days post-vaccination  as well as continued variant surveillance in PVSCs  is imperative in order to anticipate and control future surges of infection.

However  inconsistency in the nomenclature limits uniformity in its epidemiological understanding. This study provides an integration of existing classifications and describes evolutionary trends of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India. METHODS: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing  NGS . Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States Union Territories  January to September 2020  from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data  GISAID  database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages  Pangolin  lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. RESULTS: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand  West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020  the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades  respectively  were noted to be indigenous evolutions. Sites identified to be under positive selection pressure within these clades were found to occur majorly in the non-structural proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study interpreted the geographical and temporal dominance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in India over a period of nine months based on the GISAID classification. An integration of the GISAID  Nextstrain and Pangolin classifications is also provided. The emergence of new lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 was indicative of host-specific evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in India. The hotspot mutations such as those driven by positive selection need to be further characterized.

At the end of 2020  an increasing incidence of spike substitutions Q677H P was described in the USA  which involved six independent lineages. We searched for changes to this amino acid in the sequence database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained at the IHU Méditerranée Infection  Marseille  France  from 3634 patients sampled between February 2020 and April 2021. In seven genomes  0.2%   we found a deletion of five amino acids at spike positions 675–679  QTQTN  including Q677  and in 76 genomes  2.3%  we found a Q677H substitution. The 83 genomes were classified in ten different Pangolin lineages. Genomes with a spike Q677 deletion were obtained from respiratory samples collected in six cases between 28 March 2020 and 12 October 2020 and in one case on 1 February 2021. The Q677H substitution was found in genomes all obtained from respiratory samples collected from 19 January 2021 and were classified in seven different lineages. Most of these genomes  41 cases  were of UK variant. Two others were classified in the B.1.160 Pangolin lineage  Marseille-4 variant  which was first detected in July 2020 in our institute but was devoid of this substitution until 19 January 2021. Also  eight genomes were classified in the A.27 Marseille-501 lineage which was first detected in our institute in January 2021 and which either harboured or did not harbour the Q677H substitution. Thus  the spike Q677H substitution should be considered as another example of convergent evolution  as it is the case of spike substitutions L18F  E484K  L452R  and N501Y which also independently appeared in various lineages.

Different groups of scientists have foreseen different scenarios  such as the second wave or that Manaus could escape such a wave by having reached herd immunity. Here we test five hypotheses that explain the second wave of COVID-19 in Manaus: 1  The greater transmissibility of the Amazonian  gamma or P.1  variant is responsible for the second wave; 2  SARS-CoV-2 infection levels during the first wave were overestimated by those foreseeing herd immunity  and the population remained below this threshold when the second wave began at the beginning of December 2020; 3  Antibodies acquired from infection by one lineage do not confer immunity against other lineages; 4  Loss of immunity has generated a feedback phenomenon among infected people  which could generate future waves  and 5  A combination of the foregoing hypotheses. We also evaluated the possibility of a third wave in Manaus despite advances in vaccination  the new wave being due to the introduction of the delta variant in the region and the loss of immunity from natural contact with the virus. We developed a multi-strain SEIRS  Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible  model and fed it with data for Manaus on mobility  COVID-19 hospitalizations  numbers of cases and deaths. Our model contemplated the current vaccination rates for all vaccines applied in Manaus and the individual protection rates already known for each vaccine. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 gamma  P.1  strain that originated in the Amazon region is not the cause of the second wave of COVID-19 in Manaus  but rather this strain originated during the second wave and became predominant in January 2021. Our multi-strain SEIRS model indicates that neither the doubled transmission rate of the gamma variant nor the loss of immunity alone is sufficient to explain the sudden rise of hospitalizations in late December 2020. Our results also indicate that the most plausible explanation for the current second wave is a SARS-CoV-2 infection level at around 50% of the population in early December 2020  together with loss of population immunity and early relaxation of restrictive measures. The most-plausible model indicates that contact with one strain does not provide protection against other strains and that the gamma variant has a transmissibility rate twice that of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Our model also shows that  despite the advance of vaccination  and even if future vaccination advances at a steady pace  the introduction of the delta variant or other new variants could cause a new wave of COVID-19.

In a context of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance requiring correct and fast assessment of epidemiological clusters from substantial amount of samples  the present study proposes an analytical workflow for identifying accurately the PANGO lineages of SARS-CoV-2 samples and building of discriminant minimum spanning trees  MST  bypassing the usual time consuming phylogenomic inferences based on multiple sequence alignment  MSA  and substitution model. RESULTS: GENPAT constituted two collections of SARS-CoV-2 samples. The first collection consisted of SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs collected by IZSAM from the Abruzzo region  Italy   then sequenced by next generation sequencing  NGS  and analyzed in GENPAT  n = 1592   while the second collection included samples from several Italian provinces and retrieved from the reference Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data  GISAID   n = 17 201 . The main results of the present work showed that  i  GENPAT and GISAID detected the same PANGO lineages   ii  the PANGO lineages B.1.177  i.e. historical in Italy  and B.1.1.7  i.e. ‘UK variant’  are major concerns today in several Italian provinces  and the new MST-based method  iii  clusters most of the PANGO lineages together   iv  with a higher dicriminatory power than PANGO lineages   v  and faster that the usual phylogenomic methods based on MSA and substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: The genome sequencing efforts of Italian provinces  combined with a structured national system of NGS data management  provided support for surveillance SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. We propose to build phylogenomic trees of SARS-CoV-2 variants through an accurate  discriminant and fast MST-based method avoiding the typical time consuming steps related to MSA and substitution model-based phylogenomic inference.

Using VSV-based pseudovirus  we found that Omicron variant is markedly resistant to neutralization of sera from convalescents or individuals vaccinated by two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines  BBIBP-CorV . However  a homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous booster with protein subunit vaccine  ZF2001  significantly increased neutralization titers to both WT and Omicron variant. Moreover  at day 14 post the third dose  neutralizing antibody titer reduction for Omicron was less than that for convalescents or individuals who had only two doses of the vaccine  indicating that a homologous or heterologous booster can reduce the Omicron escape from neutralizing. In addition  we tested a panel of 17 SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies  mAbs . Omicron resists seven of eight authorized approved mAbs  as well as most of the other mAbs targeting distinct epitopes on RBD and NTD. Taken together  our results suggest the urgency to push forward the booster vaccination to combat the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

As of 12th Sept 2021  1 979 698 COVID-19 cases that occurred over three major epidemic waves were confirmed. The virus contributing to the three epidemic waves has not been well-studied. We sequenced the genome of 22 SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Malaysia during the second and the ongoing third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Detailed phylogenetic and genetic variation analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate genomes were performed using these newly determined sequences and all other available sequences. Results from the analyses suggested multiple independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Malaysia. A new B.1.524 G  lineage with S-D614G mutation was detected in Sabah  East Malaysia and Selangor  Peninsular Malaysia on 7th October 2020 and 14th October 2020  respectively. This new B.1.524 G  group was not the direct descendant of any of the previously detected lineages. The new B.1.524 G  carried a set of genetic variations  including A701V  position variant frequency = 0.0007  in Spike protein and a novel G114T mutation at the 5’UTR. The biological importance of the specific mutations remained unknown. The sequential appearance of the mutations  however  suggests that the spread of the new B.1.524 G  lineages likely begun in Sabah and then spread to Selangor. The findings presented here support the importance of SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing as a tool to establish an epidemiological link between cases or clusters of COVID-19 worldwide.

We also investigated the clinical characteristics to determine whether there is a difference between the variant and non-variant strain in patients with NHCAP due to COVID-19. In addition  we analyzed the clinical outcomes in NHCAP patients with mental disorders who were hospitalized in a medical institution for treatment of mental illness. METHODS: This study was conducted at five institutions and assessed a total of 836 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia  154 cases were classified as NHCAP and 335 had lineage B.1.1.7. . RESULTS: No differences in patient background  clinical findings  disease severity  or outcomes were observed in patients with NHCAP between the non-B.1.1.7 group and B.1.1.7 group. The median age  frequency of comorbid illness  rates of intensive care unit stay  and mortality rate were significantly higher in patients with NHCAP than in those with CAP. Among the patients with NHCAP  the mortality rate was highest at 37.5% in patients with recent cancer treatment  followed by elderly or disabled patients receiving nursing care  24.3%   residents of care facilities  23.0%   patients receiving dialysis  13.6%   and patients in mental hospitals  9.4% . CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that there were many differences in the clinical characteristics between NHCAP patients and CAP patients due to COVID-19. It is necessary to consider the prevention and treatment content depending on the presence or absence of applicable criteria for NHCAP.

Pfizer developed PF-07321332  PF-332   a potent inhibitor of the viral main protease  Mpro  3CLpro  that can be dosed orally and that is in clinical development. We here report that PF-332 exerts equipotent in vitro activity against the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns  VoC  and that it can completely arrest replication of the alpha variant in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface. Treatment of Syrian Golden hamsters with PF-332  250 mg kg  twice daily  completely protected the animals against intranasal infection with the beta  B.1.351  and delta  B.1.617.2  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover  treatment of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.617.2  infected animals with PF-332 completely prevented transmission to untreated co-housed sentinels.

Little is known about the effectiveness of these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants  including the highly-prevalent B.1.427 B.1.429 variant in California.. METHODS: In this quality improvement project  we collected demographic and clinical information from post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases  PVSCs   defined as health care personnel  HCP  with positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT after receiving ≥1 vaccine dose. Available specimens were tested for L452R  N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR. Mutation prevalence was compared among unvaccinated  early post-vaccinated  <=14 days after dose 1   partially vaccinated  positive test >14 days after dose 1 and ≤14 days after dose 2  and fully vaccinated  >14 days after dose 2  PVSCs. RESULTS: From December 2020-April 2021  >=23 090 HCPS received at least1 dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  and 660 HCP cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred of which 189 were PVSCs. Among the PVSCs  114  60.3%   49  25.9%  and 26  13.8%  were early post-vaccination  partially vaccinated  and fully vaccinated  respectively. Of 261 available samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated HCP  103  39.5%   including 42 PVSCs  36.5%   had L452R mutation presumed to be B.1.427 B.1.429 . When adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427 B.1.429  PVSCs did not have significantly elevated risk for infection with B.1.427 B.1.429 compared with unvaccinated HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Most PVSCs occurred prior to expected onset of full  vaccine-derived immunity. Presumptive B.1.427 B.1.429 was not more prevalent in post-vaccine cases than in unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 HCP. Continued infection control measures  particularly ≤14 days post-vaccination  and continued variant surveillance in PVSCs is imperative to control future SARS-CoV-2 surges.

The emergence of the B.1.1.7 strain  as a highly transmissible variant has accelerated the world-wide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants’ occurrence. Similarly  other extremely infectious variants  were described and further others are expected to be discovered due to the long period of time on which the pandemic situation is lasting. All described SARS-CoV-2 variants present several mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein  involved in host receptor recognition and entry into the cell. Hence  instead of sequencing the whole viral genome for variants’ tracking  herein we propose to focus on the SPIKE region to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an essential aspect to accelerate diagnostics  but also variants’ emergence progression surveillance. This proof of concept study accomplishes both at once  population-scale diagnostics and variants' tracking. This strategy relies on  1  the use of the portable MinION DNA sequencer;  2  a DNA barcoding and a SPIKE gene-centered variant’s tracking  increasing the number of candidates per assay; and  3  a real-time diagnostics and variant’s tracking monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. This strategy represents an optimal solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression surveillance  notably due to its affordable implementation  allowing its implantation even in remote places over the world.

Protection conferred by booster doses of the BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech  and mRNA-1273  Moderna  vaccines in Qatar  as compared with protection conferred by the two-dose primary series  is unclear. METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies to assess the effectiveness of booster vaccination  as compared with that of a two-dose primary series alone  against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19–related hospitalization and death during a large wave of omicron infections from December 19  2021  through January 26  2022. The association of booster status with infection was estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: In a population of 2 239 193 persons who had received at least two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine  those who had also received a booster were matched with persons who had not received a booster. Among the BNT162b2-vaccinated persons  the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 2.4%  95% confidence interval [CI]  2.3 to 2.5  in the booster cohort and 4.5%  95% CI  4.3 to 4.6  in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days of follow-up. Booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection  as compared with that of the primary series  was 49.4%  95% CI  47.1 to 51.6 . Booster effectiveness against Covid-19–related hospitalization and death due to omicron infection  as compared with the primary series  was 76.5%  95% CI  55.9 to 87.5 . BNT162b2 booster effectiveness against symptomatic infection with the delta  or B.1.617.2  variant  as compared with the primary series  was 86.1%  95% CI  67.3 to 94.1 . Among the mRNA-1273–vaccinated persons  the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 1.0%  95% CI  0.9 to 1.2  in the booster cohort and 1.9%  95% CI  1.8 to 2.1  in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days; booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection  as compared with the primary series  was 47.3%  95% CI  40.7 to 53.3 . Few severe Covid-19 cases were noted in the mRNA-1273–vaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The messenger RNA  mRNA  boosters were highly effective against symptomatic delta infection  but they were less effective against symptomatic omicron infection. However  with both variants  mRNA boosters led to strong protection against Covid-19–related hospitalization and death.  Funded by Weill Cornell Medicine–Qatar and others.

We assessed the association between location-specific community mobility and the reproduction number  R  of SARS-CoV-2 across UK local authorities. METHODS: In this modelling study  we linked data on community mobility from Google with data on R from 330 UK local authorities  for the period June 1  2020  to Feb 13  2021. Six mobility metrics are available in the Google community mobility dataset: visits to retail and recreation places  visits to grocery and pharmacy stores  visits to transit stations  visits to parks  visits to workplaces  and length of stay in residential places. For each local authority  we modelled the weekly change in R  the R ratio  per a rescaled weekly percentage change in each location-specific mobility metric relative to a pre-pandemic baseline period  Jan 3–Feb 6  2020   with results synthesised across local authorities using a random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: On a weekly basis  increased visits to retail and recreation places were associated with a substantial increase in R  R ratio 1·053 [99·2% CI 1·041–1·065] per 15% weekly increase compared with baseline visits  as were increased visits to workplaces  R ratio 1·060 [1·046–1·074] per 10% increase compared with baseline visits . By comparison  increased visits to grocery and pharmacy stores were associated with a small but still statistically significant increase in R  R ratio 1·011 [1·005–1·017] per 5% weekly increase compared with baseline visits . Increased visits to parks were associated with a decreased R  R ratio 0·972 [0·965–0·980]   as were longer stays at residential areas  R ratio 0·952 [0·928–0·976] . Increased visits to transit stations were not associated with R nationally  but were associated with a substantial increase in R in cities. An increasing trend was observed for the first 6 weeks of 2021 in the effect of visits to retail and recreation places and workplaces on R. INTERPRETATION: Increased visits to retail and recreation places  workplaces  and transit stations in cities are important drivers of increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission; the increasing trend in the effects of these drivers in the first 6 weeks of 2021 was possibly associated with the emerging alpha  B.1.1.7  variant. These findings provide important evidence for the management of current and future mobility restrictions. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust and Data-Driven Innovation initiative.
doi:10.3390/vaccines10020277,Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines against Delta Variant  B.1.617.2 : A Meta-Analysis,doi:10.3390/vaccines10020277,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35214737/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10020277,pubmed:35214737,pmc:PMC8875411,Vaccines (Basel),2022,Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines against Delta Variant  B.1.617.2 : A Meta-Analysis,Objectives: The highly transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant  DV  has contributed to a surge in cases and exacerbated the worldwide public health crisis. Several COVID-19 vaccines play a significant role in a high degree of protection against the DV. The primary purpose of this meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against the DV in terms of risk ratio  RR  among fully vaccinated  compared to unvaccinated populations. Methods: We carried out a systematic review  with meta-analysis of original studies focused on COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness against a DV clinical perspective among fully COVID-19 vaccinated populations  compared to placebo  unvaccinated populations   published between 1 May 2021 and 30 September 2021. Eleven studies containing the data of 17.2 million participants were identified and included in our study. Pooled estimates of COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness  i.e.  risk ratio  RR  against the DV with 95% confidence intervals were assessed using random-effect models. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression test and funnel plot to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and identify any differences in study design. Results: A total population of 17.2 million  17 200 341 people  were screened for the COVID-19 vaccines’ effectiveness against the DV. We found that 61.13% of the study population were fully vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The weighted pooled incidence of COVID-19 infection was more than double  20.07%  among the unvaccinated population  compared to the fully vaccinated population  8.16% . Overall  the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against the DV was 85%  RR = 0.15  95% CI: 0.07–0.31 . The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines varied slidably by study designs  87%  RR = 0.13  95% CI: 0.06–0.30  and 84%  RR = 0.16  95% CI: 0.02  1.64  for cohort and case-control studies  respectively. Conclusions: The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines were noted to offer higher protection against the DV among populations who received two vaccine doses compared with the unvaccinated population. This finding would help efforts to maximise vaccine coverage  i.e.  at least 60% to 70% of the population   with two doses among vulnerable populations  in order to have herd immunity to break the chain of transmission and gain greater overall population protection more rapidly.

Although the effect is more pronounced in the vaccine cohort  both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 show significantly reduced levels of neutralization by vaccinated and convalescent sera. Age is negatively correlated with neutralization in vaccinee  and levels of variant-specific RBD antibodies are proportional to neutralizing activities.

However  only few variants evolve as dominating and will be considered as “Variants of Concern”  VOCs  by the world health organization  WHO . At the end of 2020 the alpha  B.1.1.7  variant appeared in the United Kingdom and dominated the pandemic situation until mid of 2021 when it was substituted by the delta variant  B.1.617.2  that first appeared in India as predominant. At the end of 2021  SARS-CoV-2 omicron  B.1.1.529  evolved as the dominating variant. Here  we use in silico modeling and molecular dynamics  MD  simulations of the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 to analyze and compare the interaction pattern between the wild type  delta and omicron variants. We identified residue 493 in delta  glutamine  and omicron  arginine  with altered binding properties towards ACE2.

Widespread detection of variant strains will be critical to inform policy decisions to mitigate further spread  and post-pandemic multiplexed screening of respiratory viruses will be necessary to properly manage patients presenting with similar respiratory symptoms. In this work  we have developed a portable  magnetofluidic cartridge platform for automated PCR testing in <30 min. Cartridges were designed for multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 with either distinctive variant mutations or with Influenza A and B. The platform demonstrated a limit of detection down to 2 copies μL SARS-CoV-2 RNA with successful identification of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. The multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 Flu assay was validated using archived clinical nasopharyngeal swab eluates  n = 116  with an overall sensitivity specificity of 98.1% 95.2%  85.7% 100%  100% 98.2%  respectively  for SARS-CoV-2  Influenza A  and Influenza B. Further testing with saliva  n = 14  demonstrated successful detection of all SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with no false-positives.

METHODS: : Suspected and non-suspected cases of VOC B.1.1.7 were defined according to the VirSNiP assay  which detects N501Y and deletion H69-V70. For pre-screening  the Allplex™ and TaqPath assays were used. RESULTS: : One hundred and sixteen suspected and 113 non-suspected cases were included. In the suspected cases  the Allplex assay showed N-gene dropout  or delayed Ct values of 6.27±1.21 and 6.66±1.41 compared with those of the RdRP and S-gene target  respectively. Agreement between the Allplex and TaqPath assays was 100% when the RdRP and S-gene targets had Ct values <35. Agreement between the Allplex and VirSNiP assays was 100% with Ct value <30. CONCLUSIONS: : The Allplex assay showed excellent agreement with the current pre-screening method for VOC B.1.1.7. In addition  its automated processing enhances the feasibility of widespread use in laboratories.

Thus  to prevent COVID-19 and control the outbreak  the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most important strategies at present. The study aimed to design a multi-epitope vaccine  MEV  against SARS-CoV-2. For the development of a more effective vaccine  1549 nucleotide sequences were taken into consideration  including the variants of concern  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1and  B.1.617.2  and variants of interest  B.1.427  B.1.429  B.1.526  B.1.617.1and P.2 . A total of 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins  S  N  E  M  ORF1ab polyprotein  ORF3a  ORF6  ORF7a  ORF7b  ORF8  ORF10  were targeted for T-cell epitope prediction and S protein was targeted for B-cell epitope prediction. MEV was constructed using linkers and adjuvant beta-defensin. The vaccine construct was verified  based on its antigenicity  physicochemical properties  and its binding potential  with corresponding toll-like receptors  TLR2  TLR4   ACE2 receptor  B cell receptor. The selected vaccine construct showed considerable binding with all the receptors and a significant immune response  including elevated antibody titer and B cell population along with augmented activity of T H  cells  Tc cells and NK cells. Thus  immunoinformatics and in silico-based approaches were used for constructing MEV which is capable of eliciting both innate and adaptive immunity. In conclusion  the vaccine construct developed in this study has all the potential for the development of a next-generation vaccine which may in turn effectively combat the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 identified so far. However  in vitro and animal studies are warranted to justify our findings for its utility as probable therapeutics.

METHODS: We matched 119 cases of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection with BNT162b2 mRNA  or ChAdOx1 nCOV-19  to 476 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19  Sept 2020-March 2021   according to age and sex. Differences in 60-day all-cause mortality  hospital admission  and hospital length of stay were evaluated. Phylogenetic  single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  and minority variant allele  MVA  full genome sequencing analysis was performed. RESULTS: 116 119 cases developed COVID-19 post first vaccination dose  median 14 days  IQR 9 – 24 days . Overall  13 119  10∙9%  cases and 158 476  33∙2%  controls died  p<0.001   corresponding to 4∙5 number needed to treat  NNT . Multivariably  vaccination was associated with 69∙3%  95%CI 45∙8 – 82∙6  relative risk  RR  reduction in mortality. Similar results were seen in subgroup analysis for patients with infection onset ≥14 days after first vaccination  RR reduction 65∙1%  95%CI 27∙2 – 83∙2  NNT 4∙5   and across vaccine subgroups  BNT162b2: RR reduction 66%  95%CI 34∙9 – 82∙2  NNT 4∙7  ChAdOx1: RR reduction 78∙4%  95%CI 30∙4 – 93∙3  NNT 4∙1 . Hospital admissions  OR 0∙80  95%CI 0∙51 – 1∙28   and length of stay  -1∙89 days  95%CI -4∙57 – 0∙78  were lower for cases  while Ct values were higher  30∙8 versus 28∙8  p = 0.053 . B.1.1.7 was the predominant lineage in cases  100 108  92.6%  and controls  341 446  76.5% . Genomic analysis identified one post-vaccination case harboring the E484K vaccine escape mutation  B.1.525 lineage . CONCLUSIONS: Previous vaccination reduces mortality when B.1.1.7 is the predominant lineage. No significant lineage-specific genomic changes during phylogenetic  SNP and MVA analysis were detected.

Real-world data have shown the vaccines to be highly effective against Covid-19 and related severe disease and death. Vaccine effectiveness may wane over time since the receipt of the second dose of the ChAdOx1-S  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  and BNT162b2 vaccines. METHODS: We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 and related hospitalization and death in England. Effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 vaccines was assessed according to participant age and status with regard to coexisting conditions and over time since receipt of the second vaccine dose to investigate waning of effectiveness separately for the B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.617.2  delta  variants. RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 with the delta variant peaked in the early weeks after receipt of the second dose and then decreased by 20 weeks to 44.3%  95% confidence interval [CI]  43.2 to 45.4  with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine and to 66.3%  95% CI  65.7 to 66.9  with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was greater in persons 65 years of age or older than in those 40 to 64 years of age. At 20 weeks or more after vaccination  vaccine effectiveness decreased less against both hospitalization  to 80.0%  95% CI  76.8 to 82.7  with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine and 91.7%  95% CI  90.2 to 93.0  with the BNT162b2 vaccine  and death  to 84.8%  95% CI  76.2 to 90.3  and 91.9%  95% CI  88.5 to 94.3   respectively. Greater waning in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was observed in persons 65 years of age or older in a clinically extremely vulnerable group and in persons 40 to 64 years of age with underlying medical conditions than in healthy adults. CONCLUSIONS: We observed limited waning in vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19–related hospitalization and death at 20 weeks or more after vaccination with two doses of the ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Waning was greater in older adults and in those in a clinical risk group.

Despite unprecedented research and developmental efforts  SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals are still unavailable for the treatment of COVID-19. In most instances  SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates with the binding of Spike glycoprotein to the host cell ACE2 receptor. Utilizing the crystal structure of the ACE2 Spike receptor-binding domain  S-RBD  complex  PDB file 6M0J  in a computer-aided drug design approach  we identified and validated five potential inhibitors of S-RBD and ACE-2 interaction. Two of the five compounds  MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2  blocked the entry of pseudovirus particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. In live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays  both compounds showed antiviral activity with IC 50  values in the micromolar range  MU-UNMC-1: IC 50  = 0.67 μM and MU-UNMC-2: IC 50  = 1.72 μM  in human bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore  MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2 effectively blocked the replication of rapidly transmitting variants of concern: South African variant B.1.351  IC 50  = 9.27 and 3.00 μM  and Scotland variant B.1.222  IC 50  = 2.64 and 1.39 μM   respectively. Following these assays  we conducted “induced-fit  flexible  docking” to understand the binding mode of MU-UNMC-1 MU-UNMC-2 at the S-RBD ACE2 interface. Our data showed that mutation N501Y  present in B.1.351 variant  alters the binding mode of MU-UNMC-2 such that it is partially exposed to the solvent and has reduced polar contacts. Finally  MU-UNMC-2 displayed high synergy with remdesivir  the only approved drug for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The ongoing coronavirus infectious disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 . More than 207 million people have been infected globally  and 4.3 million have died due to this viral outbreak. While a few vaccines have been deployed  a SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19 is yet to be approved. As the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with ACE2 is critical for cellular entry  using a combination of a computer-aided drug design  CADD  approach and cell-based in vitro assays  we report the identification of five potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Out of the five  two compounds  MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2  have antiviral activity against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants from South Africa and Scotland. Furthermore  MU-UNMC-2 acts synergistically with remdesivir  RDV   suggesting that RDV and MU-UNMC-2 can be developed as a combination therapy to treat COVID-19 patients.

Here we report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a P.1.1 variant lacking the Y501 mutation in a vaccinated individual in Italy. Carefully monitoring breakthrough infections is important for assessing viral spreading of potential vaccine-resistant variants.

Here we present a comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1 2020  WA-1  strain with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VoCs and identify significant differences in viral propagation in vitro and pathogenicity in vivo using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Passive immunization with plasma from an early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 patient resulted in significant differences in the outcome of VoC-infected mice. WA-1-infected mice were protected by plasma  B.1.1.7-infected mice were partially protected  and B.1.351-infected mice were not protected. Serological correlates of disease were different between VoC-infected mice  with B.1.351 triggering significantly altered cytokine profiles than other strains. In this study  we defined infectivity and immune responses triggered by VoCs and observed that early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 human immune plasma was insufficient to protect against challenge with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in the mouse model.
doi:10.3390/ijms22179131,Possible Link between Higher Transmissibility of Alpha  Kappa and Delta Variants of SARS-CoV-2 and Increased Structural Stability of Its Spike Protein and hACE2 Affinity,doi:10.3390/ijms22179131,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502041/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179131,pubmed:34502041,pmc:PMC8431609,Int J Mol Sci,2021,Possible Link between Higher Transmissibility of Alpha  Kappa and Delta Variants of SARS-CoV-2 and Increased Structural Stability of Its Spike Protein and hACE2 Affinity,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  outbreak in December 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.617.1  Kappa   B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective  we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes  receptor binding domain -hACE2 complexes  namely wildtype  WT   Alpha variant  N501Y spike mutant   Kappa  L452R  E484Q  and Delta  L452R  T478K   and compared their dynamics  binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants  the mutations at L452R  T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein  which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further  we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

The first NWS COVID-19 case was declared 9 July 2020  but impact estimations in this region are minimal. With the rollout of vaccination and emergence of the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  we aimed to estimate COVID-19 trajectory in NWS and potential effects of vaccine coverage and hospital occupancy. Methods We conducted a mixed-method study  primarily including modelling projections of COVID-19 transmission scenarios with vaccination strategies using an age-structured  compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered  SEIR  model  supported by data from 20 semi-structured interviews with frontline health-workers to help contextualise interpretation of modelling results. Results Modelling suggested that existing low stringency non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  minimally affected COVID-19 transmission. Maintaining existing NPIs after Delta variant introduction is predicted to result in a second COVID-19 wave overwhelming hospital capacity and resulting in a 4-fold increased death toll. Simulations with up to 60% vaccination coverage by June 2022 predict a second wave is not preventable with current NPIs. However  60% vaccination coverage by June 2022 combined with 50% coverage of mask-wearing and handwashing should reduce the number of hospital beds and ventilators needed below current capacity levels. In the worst-case scenario of a more transmissible and lethal variant emerging by January 2022  a third wave is predicted. Conclusion Total COVID-19 attributable deaths are expected to remain relatively low  due largely to a young population. Given the negative socioeconomic consequences of restrictive NPIs  such as border or school-closures for an already deeply challenged population and their relative ineffectiveness in this context  policymakers and international partners should instead focus on increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage as rapidly as possible and encouraging mask-wearing.

In May 2021  Delta was escalated to a variant of concern by international authorities. We report a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 Delta cases detected in Boston  Massachusetts  in May 2021 involving a recent traveler from India and subsequent transmission to two of three close contacts. All three close contacts experienced the same primary exposure events but differed in vaccination status. The two close contacts that eventually tested positive were unvaccinated. The other had received one dose of the BNT162b  Pfizer-BioNTech  vaccine prior to exposure and received their second dose two days after exposure. This case series illustrates the effectiveness of partial vaccination in blocking Delta transmission to the vaccinated individual under circumstances where the transmission probability is high for unvaccinated individuals.

Recognizing this  a great amount of effort and dedicated study is being given to the matter. Due to the novel coronavirus’s general prevalence and rate of mutation  this is an extremely dynamic area with constant new developments. Therefore  understanding the virus’s pathogenesis and how mutations affect it is crucial. This review attempts to aid in understanding the currently most important strains and what primary changes they entail in connection to more specific mutations  and how they each affect infectivity  antigen resistance  and other properties. In an attempt to maintain relevance to the time at which this paper will be published  priority has been given to variants classified by the WHO and the CDC as of Sep. 23  2021  as “Variants of Concern”. Of particular interest in B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617.2  P.1 are the mutations affecting the Spike protein and Receptor Binding Domain  as they directly affect infectivity and susceptibility to neutralization. Certain mutations  D614G  E484K  N501Y  K417N  L452R and P681R  have appeared across several different strains  often accompanied by others that may be complementary working together to confer increased infectivity  fitness  or resistance to neutralization. We anticipate that the understanding of such COVID-19 mutations will  in the near future  prove important for diagnosis  treatment development  and vaccine development.

B.1.1.7  VOC-202012 01  has become the predominant variant in many countries and a new lineage  VOC-202102 02  harboring the E484K escape mutation in the B.1.1.7 background emerged in February 2021 1 . This variant is of concern due to reduced neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies 2 3 . However  it is not known whether this single amino acid change leads to an altered immune response. Here  we investigate differences in the immune transcriptome in hospitalized patients infected with either B.1.1.7  n=28  or B.1.1.7+E484K  n=12 . RNA-seq conducted on PBMCs isolated within five days after the onset of COVID symptoms demonstrated elevated activation of specific immune pathways  including JAK-STAT signaling  in B.1.1.7+E484K patients as compared to B.1.1.7. Longitudinal transcriptome studies demonstrated a delayed dampening of interferon-activated pathways in B.1.1.7+E484K patients. Prior vaccination with BNT162b vaccine  n=8 one dose; n=1 two doses  reduced the transcriptome inflammatory response to B.1.1.7+E484K infection relative to unvaccinated patients. Lastly  the immune transcriptome of patients infected with additional variants  B.1.258  B.1.1.163 and B.1.7.7  displayed a reduced activation compared to patients infected with B.1.1.7. Acquisition of the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background elicits an altered immune response  which could impact disease progression.

WGS has been a crucial approach in studying the evolution and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the ongoing pandemic. Despite considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been submitted to GISAID and NCBI databases  there is still scarcity of data from Malaysia. This study aims to report new Malaysian lineages of the virus  responsible for the sustained spikes in COVID-19 cases during the third wave of the pandemic. Patients with nasopharyngeal and or oropharyngeal swabs confirmed COVID-19 positive by real-time RT-PCR with C T  value < 25 were chosen for WGS. The selected SARS-CoV-2 isolates were then sequenced  characterized and analyzed along with 986 sequences of the dominant lineages of D614G variants currently circulating throughout Malaysia. The prevalence of clade GH and G formed strong ground for the presence of two Malaysian lineages of AU.2 and B.1.524 that has caused sustained spikes of cases in the country. Statistical analysis on the association of gender and age group with Malaysian lineages revealed a significant association  p <0.05 . Phylogenetic analysis revealed dispersion of 41 lineages  of these  22 lineages are still active. Mutational analysis showed presence of unique G1223C missense mutation in transmembrane domain of the spike protein. For better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Malaysia especially with reference to the reported lineages  large scale studies based on WGS are warranted.

We evaluated whether a SARS-CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle vaccine  SpFN   adjuvanted with the Army Liposomal Formulation QS21  ALFQ   conferred protection against the Alpha  B.1.1.7   and Beta  B.1.351  VOCs in Syrian golden hamsters. SpFN-ALFQ was administered as either single or double-vaccination  0 and 4 week  regimens  using a high  10 μg  or low  0.2 μg  dose. Animals were intranasally challenged at week 11. Binding antibody responses were comparable between high- and low-dose groups. Neutralizing antibody titers were equivalent against WA1  B.1.1.7  and B.1.351 variants following two high dose vaccinations. Dose-dependent SpFN-ALFQ vaccination protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced disease and viral replication following intranasal B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 challenge  as evidenced by reduced weight loss  lung pathology  and lung and nasal turbinate viral burden. These data support the development of SpFN-ALFQ as a broadly protective  next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

In this study  12 high-affinity antibodies were generated from convalescent donors in early outbreaks using immune antibody phage display libraries. Of them  two RBD-binding antibodies  F61 and H121  showed high-affinity neutralization against SARS-CoV-2  whereas three S2-target antibodies failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Following structure analysis  F61 identified a linear epitope located in residues G446–S494  which overlapped with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  binding sites  while H121 recognized a conformational epitope located on the side face of RBD  outside from ACE2 binding domain. Hence the cocktail of the two antibodies achieved better performance of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly  these two antibodies also showed efficient neutralizing activities to the variants including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  and reacted with mutations of N501Y  E484K  and L452R  indicated that it may also neutralize the recent India endemic strain B.1.617. The unchanged binding activity of F61 and H121 to RBD with multiple mutations revealed a broad neutralizing activity against variants  which mitigated the risk of viral escape. Our findings revealed the therapeutic basis of cocktail antibodies against constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and provided promising candidate antibodies to clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with broad SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The rapid spread in the UK of this new variant has caused other countries to be vigilant. Material and Methods: We based our initial screening of B.1.1.7 on the dropout of the S gene signal in the TaqPath assay  caused by the 69 70 deletion. Subsequently  we confirmed the B.1.1.7 candidates by whole genome sequencing. Results: We describe the first three imported cases of this variant from London to Madrid  subsequent post-arrival household transmission to three relatives  and the two first cases without epidemiological links to UK. One case required hospitalization. In all cases  drop-out of gene S was correcly associated to the B.1.1.7 variant  as all the corresponding sequences carried the 17 lineage-marker mutations. Conclusion: The first identifications of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in Spain indicate the role of independent introductions from the UK coexisting with post-arrival transmission in the community  since the early steps of this new variant in our country. Introducción: Recientemente  ha surgido en Reino Unido una nueva variante de SARS-CoV-2  VOC202012 01  que origina el linaje B.1.1.7. Su rápida distribución en R.U. ha alertado a otros paises a vigilar su presencia. Material y Métodos: El rastreo inicial de la variante B.1.1.7 se basó en la ausencia de amplificación del gen S en el el ensayo TaqPath  causado por la deleción 69 70. Todos los casos candidatos de corresponder a la variante B.1.1.7 con este criterio fueron posteriormente confrimados por secuenciación de genoma completo. Resultados: Describimos los primeros tres casos importados de esta variante  desde Londres a Madrid  con la posterior transmisión domiciliaria de uno de estos casos a tres faniliares y  adicionalmente  los dos primeros casos con la variante sin vínculo epidemiológico con R.U. Uno de los casos requirió hospitalización. En todos los casos el criterio de no amplificación del gen S identificó con precisión a la variante B.1.1.7  como demostró posteriormente la presencia de las 17 mutaciones marcadoras de este linaje. Conclusión: Las primeras identificaciones de la variante B.1.1.7 de SARS-CoV-2 indican un papel solapante de las introducciones independientes desde R.U.  con eventos de transmisión comunitaria  incluso desde los primeros momentos de presencia de esta variante en nuestro país.

In 2021  new variants of the virus with multiple key mutations have emerged  such as B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.617  and are threatening to render available vaccines or potential drugs ineffective. In this regard  we highlight 3CL pro   the main viral protease  as a valuable therapeutic target that possesses no mutations in the described pandemically relevant variants. 3CL pro  could therefore provide trans-variant effectiveness that is supported by structural studies and possesses readily available biological evaluation experiments. With this in mind  we performed a high throughput virtual screening experiment using CmDock and the “In-Stock” chemical library to prepare prioritisation lists of compounds for further studies. We coupled the virtual screening experiment to a machine learning-supported classification and activity regression study to bring maximal enrichment and available structural data on known 3CL pro  inhibitors to the prepared focused libraries. All virtual screening hits are classified according to 3CL pro  inhibitor  viral cysteine protease or remaining chemical space based on the calculated set of 208 chemical descriptors. Last but not least  we analysed if the current set of 3CL pro  inhibitors could be used in activity prediction and observed that the field of 3CL pro  inhibitors is drastically under-represented compared to the chemical space of viral cysteine protease inhibitors. We postulate that this methodology of 3CL pro  inhibitor library preparation and compound prioritisation far surpass the selection of compounds from available commercial “corona focused libraries”.

In contrast to these “mild” coronaviruses  over the last 20 years there have been three independent events of emergence of pandemic severe and acute life-threatening respiratory diseases caused by three novel beta-coronaviruses  SARS CoV  MERS CoV and most recently SARS CoV2. Whereas the first SARS CoV appeared in November 2002 and spontaneously disappeared by the summer of 2003  MERS CoV has continued persistently to spill over to humans via an intermediary camel vector  causing tens of cases annually. Although human-to-human transmission is rare  the fatality rate of MERS CoV disease is remarkably higher than 30%. COVID-19 however  is fortunately much less fatal  despite that its etiologic agent  SARS CoV2  is tremendously infectious  particularly with the recent evolution of the Omicron variants of concern  BA.1 and BA.2 . Of note  MERS CoV prevalence in camel populations in Africa and the Middle East is extremely high. Moreover  MERS CoV and SARS CoV2 co-exist in the Middle East and especially in Saudi Arabia and the UAE  where sporadic incidences of co-infection have already been reported. Co-infection  either due to reverse spill-over of SARS CoV2 to camels or in double infected humans could lead to recombination between the two viruses  rendering either SARS CoV2 more lethal or MERS CoV more transmittable. In an attempt to prepare for what could develop into a catastrophic event  we have focused on developing a novel epitope-based immunogen for MERS CoV. Implementing combinatorial phage-display conformer libraries  the Receptor Binding Motif  RBM  of the MERS CoV Spike protein has been successfully reconstituted and shown to be recognized by a panel of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

We assessed whether a third dose of the homologous or a different vaccine could boost immune responses. METHODS: RHH-001 is a phase 4  participant masked  two centre  safety and immunogenicity study of Brazilian adults  18 years and older  in São Paulo or Salvador who had received two doses of CoronaVac 6 months previously. The third heterologous dose was of either a recombinant adenoviral vectored vaccine  Ad26.COV2-S  Janssen   an mRNA vaccine  BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech   or a recombinant adenoviral-vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  AZD1222  AstraZeneca   compared with a third homologous dose of CoronaVac. Participants were randomly assigned  5:6:5:5  by a RedCAP computer randomisation system stratified by site  age group  18–60 years or 61 years and over   and day of randomisation  with a block size of 42. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of anti-spike IgG antibodies 28 days after the booster dose in the heterologous boost groups compared with homologous regimen  using a non-inferiority margin for the geometric mean ratio  heterologous vs homologous  of 0·67. Secondary outcomes included neutralising antibody titres at day 28  local and systemic reactogenicity profiles  adverse events  and serious adverse events. This study was registered with Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos  number RBR–9nn3scw. FINDINGS: Between Aug 16  and Sept 1  2021  1240 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four groups  of whom 1239 were vaccinated and 1205 were eligible for inclusion in the primary analysis. Antibody concentrations were low before administration of a booster dose with detectable neutralising antibodies of 20·4%  95% CI 12·8–30·1  in adults aged 18–60 years and 8·9%  4·2–16·2  in adults 61 years or older. From baseline to day 28 after the booster vaccine  all groups had a substantial rise in IgG antibody concentrations: the geometric fold-rise was 77  95% CI 67–88  for Ad26.COV2-S  152  134–173  for BNT162b2  90  77–104  for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  and 12  11–14  for CoronaVac. All heterologous regimens had anti-spike IgG responses at day 28 that were superior to homologous booster responses: geometric mean ratios  heterologous vs homologous  were 6·7  95% CI 5·8–7·7  for Ad26.COV2-S  13·4  11·6–15·3  for BNT162b2  and 7·0  6·1–8·1  for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. All heterologous boost regimens induced high concentrations of pseudovirus neutralising antibodies. At day 28  all groups except for the homologous boost in the older adults reached 100% seropositivity: geometric mean ratios  heterologous vs homologous  were 8·7  95% CI 5·9–12·9  for Ad26.COV2-S vaccine  21·5  14·5–31·9  for BNT162b2  and 10·6  7·2–15·6  for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Live virus neutralising antibodies were also boosted against delta  B.1.617.2  and omicron variants  B.1.1.529 . There were five serious adverse events. Three of which were considered possibly related to the vaccine received: one in the BNT162b2 group and two in the Ad26.COV2-S group. All participants recovered and were discharged home. INTERPRETATION: Antibody concentrations were low at 6 months after previous immunisation with two doses of CoronaVac. However  all four vaccines administered as a third dose induced a significant increase in binding and neutralising antibodies  which could improve protection against infection. Heterologous boosting resulted in more robust immune responses than homologous boosting and might enhance protection. FUNDING: Ministry of Health  Brazil.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Community based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England  individually linked with hospital admission data. PARTICIPANTS: 839 278 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19  of whom 36 233 had been admitted to hospital within 14 days  tested between 23 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure  SGTF   a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age  sex  ethnicity  deprivation  region of residence  and date of positive test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission between one and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: 27 710  4.7%  of 592 409 patients with SGTF variants and 8523  3.5%  of 246 869 patients without SGTF variants had been admitted to hospital within one to 14 days. The stratum adjusted hazard ratio of hospital admission was 1.52  95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57  for patients with covid-19 infected with SGTF variants  compared with those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age  P<0.001   with hazard ratios of 0.93-1.21 in patients younger than 20 years with versus without SGTF variants  1.29 in those aged 20-29  and 1.45-1.65 in those aged ≥30 years. The adjusted absolute risk of hospital admission within 14 days was 4.7%  95% confidence interval 4.6% to 4.7%  for patients with SGTF variants and 3.5%  3.4% to 3.5%  for those with non-SGTF variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the risk of hospital admission is higher for people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2  likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be specific to adults older than 30 years.

Early detection markers are needed to follow disease progression and foresee patient negativization. Subgenomic RNA transcripts  with a focus on sgN  were evaluated in oro nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19-affected patients with an analysis of 315 positive samples using qPCR technology. Cut-off Cq values for sgN  Cq < 33.15  and sgE  Cq < 34.06  showed correlations to high viral loads. The specific loss of sgN in home-isolated and hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients indicated negativization of patient condition  3–7 days from the first swab  respectively. A new detection kit for sgN  gene E  gene ORF1ab  and gene RNAse P was developed recently. In addition  in vitro studies have shown that 2’-O-methyl antisense RNA  related to the sgN sequence  can impair SARS-CoV-2 N protein synthesis  viral replication  and syncytia formation in human cells  i.e.  HEK-293T cells overexpressing ACE2  upon infection with VOC Alpha  B.1.1.7 -SARS-CoV-2 variant  defining the use that this procedure might have for future therapeutic actions against SARS-CoV-2.

RBS residues E484  K417 and N501 are mutated in variants first described in South Africa  B.1.351  and Brazil  P.1 . We analyzed their effects on ACE2 binding and K417N and E484K mutations on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families  IGHV3-53 3-66 and IGHV1-2   which can both bind the RBS in alternate binding modes  are abrogated by K417N  E484K  or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However  nAbs to the more conserved  cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.

The development of broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors is urgently needed. Here  we report a series of small-molecule compounds that proved effective against human coronaviruses  HCoV   such as SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern  VOCs   including Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   Delta  B.1.617.2   and Omicron  B.1.1.529   SARS-CoV  MERS-CoV  HCoV-OC43  and other viruses with class I viral fusion proteins  such as influenza virus  Ebola virus  EBOV   Nipah virus  NiV   and Lassa fever virus  LASV . They are also effective against class II enveloped viruses represented by ZIKV and class III enveloped viruses represented by vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV . Further studies have shown that these compounds may exert antiviral effects through a variety of mechanisms  including inhibiting the formation of the six-helix bundle  which is a typical feature of enveloped virus fusion with cell membranes  and or targeting viral membrane to inactivate cell-free virions. These compounds are expected to become drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.

This variant has several mutations in the spike region  S  which could increase the transmissibility of the virus 43–90% over previously circulating variants. The National Center for Disease Control  NCDC  announced on 24 February 2021 a 25% frequency of B.1.1.7 strain in Libya using a reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR assay. This assay relies on the specific identification of the H69-V70 deletion in S gene which causes its failure of amplification  SGTF . This deletion is not specific for B.1.1.7  but is also characteristic of two other SARS-COV-2 variants. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of B.1.1.7 and identify other variants circulating in Libya in February 2021. We performed whole genome sequencing of 67 positive SARS-COV-2 samples collected on 25 February 2021 in Libya which were also tested by RT-qPCR for SGTF. Our results showed that 55% of samples had mutations specific to B.1.525 strain and only ~3% of samples belonged to B.1.1.7. These findings suggested that B.1.525 was spreading widely in Libya. The use of such RT-qPCR assay  although useful to track some variants  cannot discriminate between variants with H69-V70 deletion. RT-qPCR assays could be multiplexed to identify multiple variants and screen samples prior to sequencing. We emphasize on the need for providing whole-genome sequencing to the main COVID-19 diagnostic laboratories in Libya as well as establishing international collaboration for building capacity and advancing research in this time of the pandemic.

Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card  BinaxNOW  a widely used rapid antigen test  included limit of detection  variant detection  test performance across different age-groups  and usability with self caregiver-administration. While BinaxNOW detected the highly infectious variants  B.1.1.7  Alpha  first identified in the UK  B.1.351  Beta  first identified in South Africa  P.1  Gamma  first identified in Brazil  B.1.617.2  Delta  first identified in India and B.1.2  a non-VOC  test sensitivity decreased with decreasing viral loads. Moreover  BinaxNOW sensitivity trended lower when devices were performed by patients caregivers themselves compared to trained clinical staff  despite universally high usability assessments following self caregiver-administration among different age groups. Overall  these data indicate that while BinaxNOW accurately detects the new viral variants  as rapid COVID-19 tests enter the home  their already lower sensitivities compared to RT-PCR may decrease even more due to user error.

Before immunization of mice with saRNA LNPs  we saw high expression of S-protein at both mRNA and protein levels after transfection of HEK293T 17 cells with saRNA LNPs. After oral immunization of BALB c mice with 0.1 – 10 µg saRNA LNPs   a high quantity of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies were seen with a dose-dependent pattern. Importantly  the ratio of IgG2a IgG1 in serum of vaccinated mice showed Th1 Th2 skewing response. We also found that the secreted antibodies could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants delta  B.1.617 lineage  and alpha  B.1.1.7 lineage . Re-stimulated splenocytes of vaccinated mice showed high secretion of IFN-γ  IL-6  and TNF- α . The authors think that although the preclinical study confirmed the efficacy of saRNA LNPs against SARS-CoV-2  the actual efficacy and safety of the oral vaccine must be evaluated in clinical trials.

Brazil demonstrates one of the highest numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases  and São Paulo State is the epicenter of the pandemics in the country. Nevertheless  little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 circulation in other cities in the State than São Paulo city. The objective of this study was to analyze phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in city of Ribeirão Preto at the beginning of the pandemic and during the actual second wave. Twenty-nine nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive samples were sequenced by nanopore technology  18 obtained at the initial period of the pandemic and 11 during the second wave  and analyzed them phylogenetically. The performed analysis demonstrated that the majority of the strains obtained in the initial period of the pandemic in Ribeirão Preto belonged mainly to the B1.1.33 lineage  61.1%   but B.1.1  27.8%  and B.1.1.28  11.1%  lineages were also identified. In contrast  the second wave strains were composed exclusively by the Brazilian variant of concern  VOC  P.1  91%  and P.2  9%  lineages. The obtained phylogenetic results were suggestive of successive SARS-CoV-2 lineage substitution in this Brazilian region by the P.1 VOC. The performed study examines the SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in Ribeirão Preto city via genomic surveillance data. The obtained findings can contribute for continuous long-term genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 due to the accelerated dynamics of viral lineage substitution  predict further waves and examine lineage behavior during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

To address this  we examined the neutralizing antibody  nAb  response against four major SARS-CoV-2 variants—D614G  Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta  B.1.617.2 —in health care workers  HCWs  at pre-vaccination  post-first and post-second mRNA vaccine dose  and six months post-second mRNA vaccine dose. Neutralizing antibody titers against all variants  especially the Delta variant  declined dramatically from four weeks to six months post-second mRNA vaccine dose. Notably  SARS-CoV-2 infection enhanced vaccine durability  and mRNA-1273 vaccinated HCWs also exhibited ~2-fold higher nAb titers than BNT162b2 vaccinated HCWs. Together these results demonstrate possible waning of protection from infection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant based on decreased nAb titers  dependent on COVID-19 status and the mRNA vaccine received.

We analysed nasopharyngeal samples of viral RNA collected during the disease and nasopharyngeal and lung samples collected post-mortem by RT-LAMP PCR and Next Generation Sequencing  NGS . NGS results were analysed with different bioinformatic tools to define virus lineages and the related SNPs. Both the lung and nasopharyngeal samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-LAMP. The bioinformatic analysis identified two viral RNAs from the nasal swabs as belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage  whereas the RNA collected from the lung was shown to belong to the B.1.533 lineage. This genetic observation suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus tends to change under selective pressure. The high mutation rate of ORFa1b  containing a replicase gene  was a biological image of a complex viral survival system.

We present the clinical validation of a pH-dependent colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The method revealed a limit of detection of 19.3 ± 2.7 viral genomic copies μL when using RNA extracted samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in guanidine-containing viral transport medium. Typical RT-LAMP reactions were performed at 65°C for 30 min. When compared to reverse transcriptase–quantitative polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR   up to cycle-threshold  Ct  value 32  RT-LAMP presented 98% [95% confidence interval  CI  = 95.3–99.5%] sensitivity and 100%  95% CI = 94.5–100%  specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection targeting E and N genes. No cross-reactivity was detected when testing other non–SARS-CoV virus  confirming high specificity. The test is compatible with primary RNA extraction–free samples. We also demonstrated that colorimetric RT-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest  such as variants occurring in Brazil named gamma  P.1   zeta  P.2   delta  B.1.617.2   B.1.1.374  and B.1.1.371. The method meets point-of-care requirements and can be deployed in the field for high-throughput COVID-19 testing campaigns  especially in countries where COVID-19 testing efforts are far from ideal to tackle the pandemics. Although RT-qPCR is considered the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection  it requires expensive equipment  infrastructure  and highly trained personnel. In contrast  RT-LAMP emerges as an affordable  inexpensive  and simple alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection that can be applied to massive COVID-19 testing campaigns and save lives.

We propose a statistical learning strategy  SLS  for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167 893 Spike protein sequences from coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  cases in the United States  excluding 21 391 sequences from VOI VOC strains  deposited at GISAID from 19 January 2020 to 15 March 2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants  VRVs   i.e.  residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next  generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics and to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics  false discovery rate q-value < 0.01; maximum VRV proportion >10% on at least one day . Unsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally  homology modeling was performed to gain insight into the potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs  71 of which had not previously been observed in a VOI VOC  and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identified 17 VRVs ~91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of four VRVs or more  suggesting two emerging strains  B1.1.222 and B.1.234 . Structural modeling supported a potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations. The SLS approach equally monitors all Spike residues over time  independently of existing phylogenic classifications  and is complementary to existing genomic surveillance methods.

Most common changes in SARS‐CoV‐2 are single or point nucleotide substitutions; meanwhile  insertions and deletions  indels  have been identified as a less frequent source of viral genetic variability. Here  we report the emergence of a 12‐nucleotide deletion in ORF7a  resulting in a 4‐amino acid in‐frame deletion. The Δ12 variant was identified in viruses from patients of a single outbreak and represents the first report of this deletion in South American isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Δ12 strains belong to the lineage B.1.1 and clustered separated from the remaining Uruguayan strains. The ∆12 variant was detected in 14 patients of this outbreak by NGS sequencing and or two rapid and economic methodologies: Sanger amplicon sequencing and capillary electrophoresis. The presence of strong molecular markers as the deletion described here are useful for tracking outbreaks and reveal a significant aspect of the SARS‐CoV‐2 evolution on the robustness of the virus to keep its functionality regardless loss of genetic material.

With dramatically increasing infection numbers  and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity  tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States  through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly  we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations  SNVs  encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome  with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant  and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates  but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein  and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally  end of the year data and 2021 revealed the gradual increase to prevalence of known variants of concern  particularly B.1.1.7  that have acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall  our results suggest that predominant viral genomes are dynamically evolving over time  with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation  even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may become problematic when super-spreader events  akin to serial Founder Events in evolution  drive these rare mutations to prominence.

Furthermore  the local variant was successfully neutralized by sera from fully vaccinated individuals at a comparable level to the B.1.1.7 variant and an Israel wild-type strain. While it is not a variant of concern  routine monitoring by sequencing is still required.

Recent studies revealed the emergence of virus variants with substitutions in the spike and or nucleocapsid and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins that are partly responsible for enhanced transmission and reduced or escaped anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may reduce the efficacy of antibodies and vaccines against the first identified SARS-CoV-2 strains. In order to gain insight into the emergence and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region  a comprehensive phylogenetic study of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in this region was performed. The results of these studies revealed sharp increase in virus effective population size from March to April of 2020. At least 62 different genotypes were found to circulate in this region. Variants of concern  VOCs  Alpha  Beta  Gamma and Delta co-circulate in the region  together with variants of interest  VOIs  Lambda  Mu and Zeta. Most of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region belongs to B.1 genotypes and have substitutions in the spike and or nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins that confer high transmissibility and or immune resistance. 148 amino acid positions of the spike protein and 70 positions of the nucleocapsid were found to have substitutions in different variants isolated in the region by comparison with reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1. Significant differences in codon usage among spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in South America was found  which can be linked to SARS-CoV-2 genotypes.

We isolated 216 monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 from plasmablasts and memory B cells of COVID-19 patients. The three most potent antibodies targeted distinct regions of the RBD  and all three neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. The crystal structure of the most potent antibody  CV503  revealed that it binds to the ridge region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD  competes with the ACE2 receptor  and has limited contact with key variant residues K417  E484 and N501. We designed bispecific antibodies by combining non-overlapping specificities and identified five ultrapotent bispecific antibodies that inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations of <1 ng mL. Through a novel mode of action three bispecific antibodies cross-linked adjacent spike proteins using dual NTD RBD specificities. One bispecific antibody was >100-fold more potent than a cocktail of its parent monoclonals in vitro and prevented clinical disease in a hamster model at a 2.5 mg kg dose. Notably  six of nine bispecific antibodies neutralized B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and the wild-type virus with comparable potency  despite partial or complete loss of activity of at least one parent monoclonal antibody against B.1.351. Furthermore  a bispecific antibody that neutralized B.1.351 protected against SARS-CoV-2 expressing the crucial E484K mutation in the hamster model. Thus  bispecific antibodies represent a promising next-generation countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

In the current study  large-scale whole-genome sequencing was performed between November 2020 and the end of March 2021 to provide a phylodynamic analysis of circulating variants over time. In addition  we compared the viral genomic features of March 2020 and March 2021. METHODS: A total of 1600 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed. Genomic analysis was associated with laboratory diagnostic volumes and positivity rates  in addition to an analysis of the association of selected variants of concern variants of interest with disease severity and outcomes. Our real-time surveillance features a cohort of specimens from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after completion of vaccination. RESULTS: Our data showed genomic diversity over time that was not limited to the spike sequence. A significant increase in the B.1.1.7 lineage  alpha variant  in March 2021 as well as a transient circulation of regional variants that carried both the concerning S: E484K and S: P681H substitutions were noted. Lineage B.1.243 was significantly associated with intensive care unit admission and mortality. Genomes recovered from fully vaccinated individuals represented the predominant lineages circulating at specimen collection time  and people with those infections recovered with no hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the importance of genomic surveillance coupled with laboratory  clinical  and metadata analysis for a better understanding of the dynamics of viral spread and evolution.

These disparities persisted during the B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.1.529  Omicron  variant surges during late 2021 and early 2022  1 2 . Rural populations tend to be older  aged ≥65 years  and uninsured and are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and live farther from facilities that provide tertiary medical care  placing them at higher risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes  2 . To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities between urban and rural populations  CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among persons aged ≥5 years who received their first dose of either the BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  or mRNA-1273  Moderna  COVID-19 vaccine or a single dose of the Ad.26.COV2.S  Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]  COVID-19 vaccine during December 14  2020-January 31  2022  in 50 states and the District of Columbia  DC . COVID-19 vaccination coverage with ≥1 doses in rural areas  58.5%  was lower than that in urban counties  75.4%  overall  with similar patterns across age groups and sex. Coverage with ≥1 doses varied among states: 46 states had higher coverage in urban than in rural counties  one had higher coverage in rural than in urban counties. Three states and DC had no rural counties; thus  urban-rural differences could not be assessed. COVID-19 vaccine primary series completion was higher in urban than in rural counties. However  receipt of booster or additional doses among primary series recipients was similarly low between urban and rural counties. Compared with estimates from a previous study of vaccine coverage among adults aged ≥18 years during December 14  2020-April 10  2021  these urban-rural disparities among those now eligible for vaccination  aged ≥5 years  have increased more than twofold through January 2022  despite increased availability and access to COVID-19 vaccines. Addressing barriers to vaccination in rural areas is critical to achieving vaccine equity  reducing disparities  and decreasing COVID-19-related illness and death in the United States  2 .

Previously  we used a structural design approach to develop picomolar range miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Here  we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead binder  LCB1  to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden  diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation  and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung even when given as many as five days before or two days after virus inoculation. Importantly  LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain  WA1 2020   an emerging B.1.1.7 strain  and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions. These data support development of LCB1v1.3 for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Latin America is the hardest-hit region of the world  accumulating almost 20% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In Costa Rica  from the first detected case on March 6th to December 31st almost 170 000 cases have been reported. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 185 sequences  52 from the first months of the pandemic  and 133 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades  G  GH  and GR  and three PANGOLIN lineages  B.1  B.1.1  and B.1.291  were predominant  suggesting multiple re-introductions from other regions. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 283 distinct nucleotide variants  following a power-law distribution with 190 single nucleotide mutations in a single sequence  and only 16 mutations were found in >5% sequences. These mutations were distributed through the whole genome. The prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike  98.9% in Costa Rica   ORF8 L84S  1.1%  is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly  the frequency of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica  reaching 29.2% detection in the full genome analyses in November 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences worldwide in 2020. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggests a potential effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection  but no differences with other genomes on transmissibility  severity nor vaccine effectiveness are predicted. In conclusion  genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggest the introduction of lineages from other countries and the detection of mutations in line with other studies  but pointing out the local increase in the detection of Spike-T1117I variant. The genomic features of this virus need to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.

There is a severe lack of specific treatment options for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2. In this study  we used a pseudotype virus  pv  containing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein to screen a botanical drug library containing 1037 botanical drugs to identify agents that prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. Our study identified four hits  including angeloylgomisin O  schisandrin B  procyanidin  and oleanonic acid  as effective SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. A mechanistic study revealed that these four agents inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry by blocking spike  S  protein-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore  angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a high selective index  SI; 50% cytotoxic concentration 50% inhibition concentration . Our drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays revealed that angeloylgomisin O has synergistic effects in combination with remdesivir  a drug widely used to treat SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections. We also showed that two hits could inhibit the newly emerged alpha  B.1.1.7  and beta  B.1.351  variants. Our findings collectively indicate that angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 efficiently  thereby making them potential therapeutic agents to treat the coronavirus disease of 2019.

To explore and further understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the B.1.1.7 spread in the 368 districts of Taiwan  a district‐level geographic prediction model of the risk of COVID‐19 symptom onset has been proposed. It has been found that   a  the human mobility  epidemic alert measures  and vaccination rates all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of B.1.1.7 transmission;  b  for regions with high human mobility and low vaccination rates  the partial relaxation of entry quarantine measures for specific imported groups would  in fact  lead to a wide spread of B.1.1.7 with a consequent doubling of high‐onset‐risk areas and together with the overall onset risk  a further increase of more than 20% would occur;  c  compared with the closing of business places and public venues in all districts  both lockdown in those areas of high‐onset‐risk and the gathered control effects regarding other districts  the control of B.1.1.7 spread would be better enabled by an onset risk reduction of up to 91.36%. Additionally  an increase in the vaccination rate in each district by up to 5–10 times would further reduce the onset risk by 6.07%–62.22%.

The COVID-19 infections were continued to roll all over the places although the information on genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 between both immunized and unimmunized group was unavailable. The objective of this study was to compare the proportion of immune escaping variants between those groups. METHODS: A total of 4718 nasopharygeal samples were collected from March 1 until April 15  2021  of which  834  18%  were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The minimum sample size was calculated as 108 who were randomly selected for telephone interview and provided consent. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity among both immunized and unimmunized groups was measured. A total of 63 spike protein sequences and 14 whole-genome sequences were performed from both groups and phylogenetic reconstruction and mutation analysis were compared. RESULTS: A total of 40 respondents  37%  N = 108  received single-dose and 2  2%  received both doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  which significantly reduce dry cough  loss of appetite and difficulties in breathing compared to none. There was no significant difference in hospitalization  duration of hospitalization or reduction of other symptoms like running nose  muscle pain  shortness of breathing or generalized weakness between immunized and unimmunized groups. Spike protein sequence assumed 21  87.5%  B.1.351  one B.1.526 and two 20B variants in immunized group compared to 27  69%  B.1.351  5  13%  B.1.1.7  4  10%  20B  2 B.1.526 and one B.1.427 variant in unimmunized group. Whole genome sequence analysis of 14 cases identified seven B.1.351 Beta V2  three B.1.1.7 Alpha V1  one B.1.526 Eta and the rest three 20B variants. CONCLUSION: Our study observed that ChAdOx1 could not prevent the new infection or severe COVID-19 disease outcome with single dose while the infections were mostly caused by B.1.351 variants in Bangladesh.

In December 2020  the outbreak of variant of concern  VOC  202012 01  lineage B.1.1.7  in the United Kingdom defined a turning point during the pandemic  immediately posing a worldwide threat on the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. Here  we reported the evolution of B.1.1.7 lineage-related infections  analyzing samples collected from January 1 st  2021  until April 15 th  2021  in Friuli Venezia Giulia  a northeastern region of Italy. A cohort of 1508 nasopharyngeal swabs was analyzed by High Resolution Melting  HRM  and 479 randomly selected samples underwent Next Generation Sequencing analysis  NGS   uncovering a steady and continuous accumulation of B.1.1.7 lineage-related specimens  joined by sporadic cases of other known lineages  i.e. harboring the Spike glycoprotein p.E484K mutation . All the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been analyzed in order to highlight all the rare mutations that may eventually result in a new variant of interest. This work suggests that a thorough monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by NGS is essential to contain any new variant that could jeopardize all the efforts that have been made so far to resolve the emergence of the pandemic.

BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019  Covid-19  and is currently approved  conditionally approved  or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization  data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable. METHODS: In an ongoing  placebo-controlled  observer-blinded  multinational  pivotal efficacy trial  we randomly assigned 44 165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-μg doses  at 21 days apart  of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety  which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3%  95% confidence interval [CI]  89.0 to 93.2  through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages  sexes  race or ethnic groups  and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7%  95% CI  80.3 to 99.9 . In South Africa  where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351  or beta  was predominant  a vaccine efficacy of 100%  95% CI  53.5 to 100  was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy  BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate  E  to Lysine  K  substitution at position 484  E484K  in the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1 2020 virus and a recombinant  r SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1 2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer  negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8]  moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11] . In addition  we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2  vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold  moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold  compared to USA-WA1 2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike  the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples  with low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However  human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1 2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore  it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals with a primer vaccination. Our data suggests that this may leave vaccinees less protected against newly emerging variants.

We investigated the results of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs tested from December 2020 to February 2021  to verify any difference on the viral load and persistence between people infected by lineage B.1.1.7 and others. Statistically significant lower values of C T  associated with the detection of the N protein encoding gene  C T  N  were observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection  median C T  N = 15.8  in comparison to those infected by other lineages  median C T  N = 16.9 . A significant longer duration of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection  16 days  in comparison to those infected by other lineages  14 days .

In the current study  we formulated protein subunit vaccines with AS03 adjuvant and recombinant proteins of S1 subunit of SARS‐CoV‐2  S1‐WT  and S1 variant  K417N  E484K  N501Y  and D614G  subunit  S1‐Mut   and immunized transgenic mice that express human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2  hACE2 . The S1 protein‐specific antibody production and the neutralization capability for SARS‐CoV‐2 and B.1.351 variant were measured after immunization in mice. The results revealed that the S1‐Mut antigens were more effective in inhibiting the receptor‐binding domain and ACE2 binding in B.1.351 variant than in wild‐type SARS‐CoV‐2. Furthermore  the development of a bivalent vaccine exhibited the ideal neutralization properties against wild‐type and B.1.351 variant  as well as other variants. Our findings may provide a rationale for the development of a bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein that can induce the neutralizing antibodies against both SARS‐CoV‐2 variants and wild‐type of the virus and may be of importance to explore the potential clinical use of bivalent recombinant vaccine in the future.

Besides mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines  effective protein-based vaccines are needed for immunization against current and emerging variants. We have developed a virus-like particle  VLP -based vaccine using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system  a robust production platform known for its scalability  low cost  and safety. Baculoviruses were constructed encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins: full-length S  stabilized secreted S  or the S1 domain. Since subunit S only partially protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge  we produced S1 for conjugation to bacteriophage AP205 VLP nanoparticles using tag catcher technology. The S1 yield in an insect-cell bioreactor was ∼11 mg liter  and authentic protein folding  efficient glycosylation  partial trimerization  and ACE2 receptor binding was confirmed. Prime-boost immunization of mice with 0.5 μg S1-VLPs showed potent neutralizing antibody responses against Wuhan and UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variants. This two-component nanoparticle vaccine can now be further developed to help alleviate the burden of COVID-19.

On March 7th  2021  approximately ten days after COVID-19 appeared in the family  the onset of respiratory signs in a cat by COVID-19-affected owners led to an in-depth diagnostic investigation  combining clinical and serological data with rt-qPCR-based virus detection and whole genome sequencing. The Alpha variant was confirmed first in the owners and a few days later in the cat that was then monitored weekly: the course was similar with one-week lag time in the cat. In addition  based on comparative analysis of genome sequences from our study and from 200 random Italian cases of Alpha variant  the familial cluster was confirmed. The temporal sequence along with the genomic data support a human-to-animal transmission. Such an event emphasizes the importance of studying the circulation and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in humans and animals to better understand and prevent potential spillover risks or unwarranted alerts involving our pet populations.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern posed a severe threat to the global public health efforts. To assess the potential consequence of these emerging variants on public health  continuous molecular epidemiology is of vital importance. The current study has been designed to investigate the major SARS-CoV-2 variants and emerging mutations in virus structural and non-structural proteins  NSP  during the fourth wave in September 2021 from the Punjab province of Pakistan. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples have been collected from major cities were subjected to next-generation sequencing. Among the 20 whole genomes  GenBank Accession SRR16294858-SRR16294877   2 samples failed to be completely sequenced. These genome sequences harbored 207 non-synonymous mutations  among which 19 were unique to GISAID. The genome sequences were detected: Delta 21I  21J variants  B.1.617.2 . Mutation’s spike_F157del  spike_P681R  spike_T478K  spike_T19R  spike_L452R  spike_D614G  spike_G142D  spike_E156G  and spike_R158del have been detected in all samples where K1086Q  E554K  and C1250W were unique in spike protein. These genomic sequences also harbored 129 non-synonymous mutations in NSP. The most common were NSP3_P1469S  N = 17   NSP3_A488S  N = 17   NSP3_P1228L  N = 17   NSP4_V167L  N = 17   NSP4_T492I  N = 17   NSP6_T77A  N = 17   NSP14_A394V  N = 17   NSP12_G671S  N = 18   and NSP13_P77L  N = 18 . The mutation  F313Y in NSP12  detected in the current study  was found in a single isolate from Belgium. Numerous other unique mutations have been detected in the virus papain-like protease  NSP3   main protease  NSP5   and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  NSP12 . The most common non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein were subjected to stability analysis  exhibiting a stabilizing effect on structures. The presence of Delta variants may affect therapeutic efforts and vaccine efficacy. Continuous genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan may be useful for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Against the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern”  VOCs  during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021  whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches were undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of the current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that newly identified lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were predominantly circulating. The signature mutations possessed by these strains were L452R  T478K  E484Q  D614G and P681R in the spike protein  including within the receptor-binding domain  RBD . Of these  the mutations at residue positions 452  484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R  T478K and E484Q revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding while P681R in the furin cleavage site could increase the rate of S1-S2 cleavage  resulting in better transmissibility. The two RBD mutations  L452R and E484Q  indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  and may affect their neutralization potential. Further in vitro in vivo studies would help confirm the phenotypic changes of the mutant strains. Overall  the study revealed that the newly emerged variants were responsible for the second wave of COVID-19 in Maharashtra. Lineage B.1.617.2 has been designated as a VOC delta and B.1.617.1 as a variant of interest kappa  and they are being widely reported in the rest of the country as well as globally. Continuous monitoring of these and emerging variants in India is essential.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS ‐CoV‐2 lineages B.1.1.7  B.1.617  B.1.351  and P.1 were reported to have higher infection rates than that of wild one. These mutations were noticed to happen in the receptor‐binding domain of spike protein  S‐RBD   especially mutations N501Y  E484Q  E484K  K417N  K417T  and L452R. Currently  there is still no specific medicine against the virus; moreover  cytokine storm is also a dangerous factor for severe infected patients. In this study  potential S‐RBD‐targeted active monomers from traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica Stapf  ephedra  were discovered by virtual screening. NanoBiT assay was performed to confirm blocking activities of the screened compounds against the interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 S‐RBD and angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2  ACE2 . We further analyzed the blocking effect of the active compounds on the interactions of mutated S‐RBD and ACE2 by computational studies. Moreover  antiinflammatory activities were evaluated using qRT‐PCR  enzyme‐linked immune sorbent assay  and Western blot analysis. As a result  pseudoephedrine  MHJ‐17  and its derivative  MHJ‐11  were found as efficient inhibitors disrupting the interactions between ACE2 and both wild and mutated S‐RBDs. In addition  they also have antiinflammatory activities  which can be potential drug candidates or lead compounds for further study.

Mutations deletions of the virion’s prefusion Spike protein may have significant impact on vaccines and therapeutics that utilize this key structural protein in their mitigation strategies. In this study  we have demonstrated how dominant energetic landscape mappings  “glue points”  based on ab inito all-atom force fields coupled with phylogenetic sequence alignment information can identify key residue mutations and deletions associated with variants. We also found several examples of excellent homology of stabilizing residue glue points across the lineages of betacoronavirus Spike proteins that we have called “sequence homologous glue points.” SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the least number of stabilizing glue points associated with interchain interactions among Down-state protomers across lineages. Additionally  we computationally studied variants among the trimeric Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 using all-atom molecular dynamics to ascertain structural and energetic changes among variants. We examined both a theoretically based triple mutant and the UK or B.1.1.7 variant. For the theoretical triple mutant  we demonstrated through alanine substitutions that three key residues could cause the transition of Down-to-Up protomer states  where the transition is characterized by the “arm” length of the receptor-binding domain  RBD  rather than the hinge angle. For the B.1.1.7 variant  we demonstrated the critical importance of mutations D614G and N501Y on the structure and binding  respectively  of the Spike protein. We note that these same two key mutations are also found in the South African B.1.351 variant. IMPORTANCE Viral variants represent a major challenge to monitoring viral outbreaks and formulating strategic health care responses. Variants represent transmitting viruses that have specific mutations and deletions associated with their genome. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses  betacoronaviruses   many of these mutations and deletions are associated with the Spike protein that the virus uses to infect cells. Here  we have analyzed both SARS-CoV-2 variants and related viruses  such as Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus  MERS-CoV   in order to understand not only differences  but also key similarities between them. Understanding similarities can be as important as differences in determining key functional features of a class of viruses  such as the betacoronaviruses. We have used both phylogenetic analysis  which traces genetic similarities and differences  along with independent biophysics analysis  which adds function or behavior  in order to determine possible functional differences and hence possible transmission and infection differences among variants and lineages.

METHODS: We classified 466677 hospital admissions for COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021 into 4 mutually exclusive severity grades based on indicators present on admission  from most to least severe : Grade 4 included intensive care unit  ICU  admission and invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV ; grade 3 included non-IMV ICU and or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; grade 2 included diagnosis of acute respiratory failure; and grade 1 included none of the above indicators. Trends were stratified by sex  age  race ethnicity  and comorbid conditions. We also examined severity in states with high vs low Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant burden. RESULTS: Severity tended to be lower among women  younger adults  and those with fewer comorbidities compared to their counterparts. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 1 or 2 fluctuated over time  but these less-severe grades comprised a majority  75%–85%  of admissions every month. Grades 3 and 4 consistently made up a minority of admissions  15%–25%   and grade 4 showed consistent decreases in all subgroups  including states with high Alpha variant burden. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical severity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has varied over time but has not consistently or markedly worsened over time. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 4 decreased in all subgroups. There was no consistent evidence of worsening severity in states with higher vs lower Alpha prevalence.

We developed a duplex real-time RT-qPCR assay to detect  discriminate  and quantitate SARS-CoV-2 variants containing one of its mutation signatures  the ΔHV69 70 deletion  and used it to trace the community circulation of the B.1.1.7 variant in Spain through the Spanish National SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance System  VATar COVID-19 . The B.1.1.7 variant was detected earlier than clinical epidemiological reporting by the local authorities  first in the southern city of Málaga  Andalucía  in week 20_52  year_week   and multiple introductions during Christmas holidays were inferred in different parts of the country. Wastewater-based B.1.1.7 tracking showed a good correlation with clinical data and provided information at the local level. Data from wastewater treatment plants  which reached B.1.1.7 prevalences higher than 90% for ≥2 consecutive weeks showed that 8.1 ± 2.0 weeks were required for B.1.1.7 to become dominant. The study highlights the applicability of RT-qPCR-based strategies to track specific mutations of variants of concern as soon as they are identified by clinical sequencing and their integration into existing wastewater surveillance programs  as a cost-effective approach to complement clinical testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
doi:10.1111/all.15065,In vitro data suggest that Indian delta variant B.1.617 of SARS‐CoV‐2 escapes neutralization by both receptor affinity and immune evasion,doi:10.1111/all.15065,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453338/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15065,pubmed:34453338,pmc:PMC8652796,Allergy,2021,In vitro data suggest that Indian delta variant B.1.617 of SARS‐CoV‐2 escapes neutralization by both receptor affinity and immune evasion,BACKGROUND: Emerged mutations can be attributed to increased transmissibility of the B.1.617 and B.1.36 Indian delta variants of SARS‐CoV‐2  most notably substitutions L452R E484Q and N440K  respectively  which occur in the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of the Spike  S  fusion glycoprotein. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effects of mutations L452R E484Q and N440K  as well as the previously studied mutation E484K present in variants B.1.351 and P.1  on the affinity of RBD for ACE2  SARS‐CoV‐2 main receptor. We also aimed to assess the ability of antibodies induced by natural infection or by immunization with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to recognize the mutated versions of the RBD  as well as blocking the interaction RBD‐ACE2  an important surrogate readout for virus neutralization. METHODS: To this end  we produced recombinant wild‐type RBD  as well as RBD containing each of the mutations L452R E484Q  N440K  or E484K  the latest present in variants of concern B.1.351 and P.1   as well as the ectodomain of ACE2. Using Biolayer Interferometry  BLI   we measured the binding affinity of RBD for ACE2 and the ability of sera from COVID‐19 convalescent donors or subjects immunized with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to block this interaction. Finally  we correlated these results with total anti‐RBD IgG titers measured from the same sera by direct ELISA. RESULTS: The binding assays showed L452R E484Q double‐mutant RBD to interact with ACE2 with higher affinity  K D  = 4.6 nM  than wild‐type  K D  = 21.3 nM  or single mutants N440K  K D  = 9.9 nM  and E484K  K D  = 19.7 nM  RBDs. Meanwhile  the anti‐RBD IgG titration resulted in lower recognition of mutants E484K and L452R E484Q by infection‐induced antibodies  whereas only mutant E484K was recognized less by antibodies induced by vaccination. More interestingly  sera from convalescent as well as immunized subjects showed reduced ability to block the interaction between ACE2 and RBD mutants E484K and L452R E484Q  as shown by the inhibition assays. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the newly emerged SARS‐CoV‐2 variant B.1.617  as well as the better‐studied variants B.1.351 and P.1  all containing a mutation at position E484  display increased transmissibility both due to their higher affinity for the cell receptor ACE2 and their ability to partially bypass immunity generated against the wild‐type virus. For variant B.1.36  with a point mutation at position N440   only increased affinity seems to play a role.

S protein is heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation sites are relatively conserved  thus glycans on S protein surface could be a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies against variants. Here  we collected 12 plant-derived lectins with different carbohydrate specificity and evaluated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against mutant strains and epidemic variants using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. The Lens culinaris-derived lentil lectin which specifically bind to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at the non-reducing end terminus showed most potent and broad antiviral activity against a panel of mutant strains and variants  including the artificial mutants at N- O-linked glycosylation site  natural existed amino acid mutants  as well as the epidemic variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. Lentil lectin also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found lentil lectin could block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the early steps of infection. Using structural information and determined N-glycan profile of S trimer  taking together with the carbohydrate specificity of lentil lectin  we provide a basis for the observed broad spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lentil lectin showed weak haemagglutination activity at 1 mg mL and no cytotoxicity activity  and no weight loss was found in single injection mouse experiment. This report provides the first evidence that lentil lectin strongly inhibit infection of SARS-COV-2 variants  which should provide valuable insights for developing future anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.

Containment strategies rely on rapid and consistent methodology for molecular detection and characterization. Emerging variants of concern  VOCs  are currently associated with increased infectivity and immune escape  natural defence mechanisms and vaccine . Several VOCs have been detected  including Alpha variant  B.1.1.7   Beta variant  B.1.351   Gamma variant  P.1 B.1.1.28.1  and Delta variant  B.1.617.2   first identified in the UK  South Africa  Brazil and India  respectively. Here  a rapid and low-cost technique was validated to distinguish the Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants by detecting spike gene mutations using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methodology  RT-PCR . A total of 132 positive patients affected by coronavirus disease-19  COVID-19  were analysed by employing RT-PCR to target single-nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  to screen spike protein mutations. All data were validated by the next-generation sequencing  NGS  methodology and using sequences from a public database. Among 132 COVID-19-positive samples  we were able to discriminate all of the investigated SARS-CoV-2 variants with 100% concordance when compared with the NGS method. RT-PCR -based assays for identifying circulating VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a rapid method used to identify specific SARS-CoV-2 variants  allowing for a better survey of the spread of the virus and its transmissibility in the pandemic phase.

Further  protection and hygiene measures like fixed children-staff groups  ventilation and surface disinfection were introduced in ECEC centres. To inform or modify public health measures in ECEC  we investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and staff in ECEC centres in light of social determinants  i.e. the socioeconomic status of the children  and recommended structural and hygiene measures. We focus on the question if the relevant factors differ between the 2nd  when no variant of concern  VOC  circulated  and the 3rd wave  when VOC B.1.1.7  Alpha  predominated . METHODS: Based on panel data from a weekly online survey of ECEC centre managers  calendar week 36 2020 to 22 2021  ongoing  including approx. 8500 centres  we estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and staff using random-effect-within-between  REWB  panel models for count data in the 2nd and 3rd wave. RESULTS: ECEC centres with a high proportion of children with low socioeconomic status  SES  have a higher risk of infections in staff and children. Strict contact restrictions between groups like fixed group assignments for children and fixed staff assignments to groups prevent infections. Both effects tend to be stronger in the 3rd wave. CONCLUSION: ECEC centres with a large proportion of children with a low SES background and lack of using fixed child staff cohorts experience higher COVID-19 rates. Over the long run  centres should be supported in maintaining recommended measures. Preventive measures such as the vaccination of staff should be prioritised in centres with large proportions of low SES children.

Due to critical role of spike protein in cell entry and pathogenesis  mutations in spike regions have been reported to enhance transmissibility  disease severity  possible escape from vaccine‐induced immune response and reduced diagnostic sensitivity specificity. Considering the structure‐function impact of mutations  understanding the molecular details of these key mutations of newly emerged variants lineages is of urgent concern. In this review  we have explored the literature on key spike mutations harbored by alpha  beta  gamma and delta ‘variants of concern’  VOCs  and discussed their molecular consequences in the context of resultant virus biology. Commonly all these VOCs i.e. B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.617.2 lineages have decisive mutation in Receptor Binding Motif  RBM  region and or region around Furin cleavage site  FCS  of spike protein. In general  mutation induced disruption of intra‐molecular interaction enhances molecular flexibility leading to exposure of spike protein surface in these lineages to make it accessible for inter‐molecular interaction with hACE2. A disruption of spike antigen‐antibody inter‐molecular interactions in epitope region due to the chemical nature of substituting amino acid hampers the neutralization efficacy. Simplified surveillance of mutation induced changes and their consequences at molecular level can contribute in rationalizing mutation‘s impact on virus biology. It is believed that molecular level dissection of these key spike mutation will assist the future investigations for a more resilient outcome against severity of COVID‐19.

Most COVID-19 pneumonia in non-elderly patients  aged <60 years  are classified as atypical pneumonia using the JRS scoring system. We evaluated whether physicians could distinguish between COVID-19 pneumonia and M. pneumoniae pneumonia using chest computed tomography  CT  findings. In addition  we investigated chest CT findings if there is a difference between the variant and non-variant strain. METHODS: This study was conducted at five institutions and assessed a total of 823 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia  335 had lineage B.1.1.7.  and 100 patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. RESULTS: In COVID-19 pneumonia  at the first CT examination  peripheral  bilateral ground-glass opacity  GGO  with or without consolidation or crazy-paving pattern was observed frequently. GGO frequently had a round morphology  39.2% . No differences were observed in the radiological findings between the non-B.1.1.7 groups and B.1.1.7 groups. The frequency of pleural effusion  lymphadenopathy  bronchial wall thickening and nodules  tree-in-bud and centrilobular  was low. In contrast to COVID-19 pneumonia  bronchial wall thickening  84%  was observed most frequently  followed by nodules  81%  in M. pneumoniae pneumonia. These findings were significantly higher in M. pneumoniae pneumonia than COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that a combination of the JRS scoring system and chest CT findings is useful for the rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients aged <60 years. However  this clinical and radiographic diagnosis is not adapted to elderly people.

Four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617.2  and P.1  and two variants of interest including C.37 and B.1.621 have been reported to have potential immune escape  and one or more mutations endow them with worrisome epidemiologic  immunologic  or pathogenic characteristics. This review introduces the latest research progress on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern  key mutation sites  and their effects on virus infectivity  mortality  and immune escape. Moreover  we compared the effects of various clinical SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and convalescent sera on epidemic variants  and evaluated the neutralizing capability of several antibodies on epidemic variants. In the end  SARS-CoV-2 evolution strategies in different transmission stages  the impact of different vaccination strategies on SARS-CoV-2 immune escape  antibody therapy strategies and COVID-19 epidemic control prospects are discussed. This review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the secret of SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest concern and immune escape.

METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study  cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults with onset of symptoms between 14 February and 3 May 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age  sex  region  population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire on recent activity-related exposures and vaccination history. Information about the infecting virus was based on a screening RT-PCR for either B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 P.1 variants. FINDINGS: Included in our analysis were 7 288 adults infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus  31 313 with the B.1.1.7 lineage  2 550 with B.1.351 P1 lineages  and 3 644 controls. In multivariable analysis  the vaccine effectiveness  95% confidence interval  seven days after the second dose of mRNA vaccine was estimated at 88%  81-92   86%  81-90  and 77%  63-86  against COVID-19 with the original virus  the B.1.1.7 lineage  and the B.1.351 P.1 lineages  respectively. Recent  2 to 6 months  history of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 83%  76-88   88%  85-91  and 83%  71-90  protective against COVID-19 with the original virus  the B.1.1.7 lineage  and the B.1.351 P.1 lineages  respectively; and more distant  > 6 months  infections were 76%  54-87   84%  75-90   and 74%  41-89  protective against COVID-19 with the original virus  the B.1.1.7 lineage  and the B.1.351 P.1 lineages  respectively. INTERPRETATION: In real-life settings  two doses of mRNA vaccines proved to be effective against COVID-19 with the original virus  B.1.1.7 lineage and B.1.351 P.1 lineages.

Simply observing that a variant is increasing in frequency is relatively straightforward  but more sophisticated methodology is needed to determine whether a new variant is a global threat and the magnitude of its selective advantage. We present two models for quantifying the strength of selection for new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the background of contemporaneous variants. These methods range from a detailed model of dynamics within one country to a broad analysis across all countries  and they include alternative explanations such as migration and drift. We find evidence for strong selection favoring the D614G spike mutation and B.1.1.7  Alpha   weaker selection favoring B.1.351  Beta   and no advantage of R.1 after it spreads beyond Japan. Cutting back data to earlier time horizons reveals that uncertainty is large very soon after emergence  but that estimates of selection stabilize after several weeks. Our results also show substantial heterogeneity among countries  demonstrating the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

There is an urgent unmet need for safe  affordable  and effective therapeutics against COVID-19. In this regard  drug repurposing is considered as a promising approach. We assessed the compounds that affect the endosomal acidic environment by applying human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2 - expressing cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein-pseudotyped HIV reporter virus and identified that obatoclax resulted in the strongest inhibition of S protein-mediated virus entry. The potent antiviral activity of obatoclax at nanomolar concentrations was confirmed in different human lung and intestinal cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype system as well as clinical virus isolates. Furthermore  we uncovered that obatoclax executes a double-strike against SARS-CoV-2. It prevented SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking endocytosis of virions through diminished endosomal acidification and the corresponding inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L. Additionally  obatoclax impaired the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion by targeting the MCL-1 protein and reducing furin protease activity. In accordance with these overarching mechanisms  obatoclax blocked the virus entry mediated by different S proteins derived from several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as  Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta  B.1.617.2 . Taken together  our results identified obatoclax as a novel effective antiviral compound that keeps SARS-CoV-2 at bay by blocking both endocytosis and membrane fusion. Our data suggested that obatoclax should be further explored as a clinical drug for the treatment of COVID-19.

They only partially discriminate whether VE DIS  is mediated by preventing infection completely  which is defined as detection of virus in the airways  VE SUSC    or by preventing symptoms despite infection  VE SYMP  . Vaccine efficacy against transmissibility given infection  VE INF    the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients  is also not measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington  we demonstrate that if the Moderna  mRNA-1273QS  and Pfizer-BioNTech  BNT162b2  vaccines  which demonstrated VE DIS  > 90% in clinical trials  mediate VE DIS  by VE SUSC   then a limited fourth epidemic wave of infections with the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant would have been predicted in spring 2021 assuming rapid vaccine roll out. If high VE DIS  is explained by VE SYMP   then high VE INF  would have also been necessary to limit the extent of this fourth wave. Vaccines which completely protect against infection or secondary transmission also substantially lower the number of people who must be vaccinated before the herd immunity threshold is reached. The limited extent of the fourth wave suggests that the vaccines have either high VE SUSC  or both high VE SYMP  and high VE INF  against B.1.1.7. Finally  using a separate intra-host mathematical model of viral kinetics  we demonstrate that a 0.6 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve 50% VE INF   which suggests that human challenge studies with a relatively low number of infected participants could be employed to estimate all three vaccine efficacy metrics.

Two versions of the variant were identified  both with the prevalent D614G mutation in the spike protein  together with four novel point mutations and with an E484K or S477N mutation in the receptor-binding domain  raising concerns of possible resistance to vaccine-elicited and therapeutic antibodies. We report that convalescent-phase sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies retain full neutralizing titer against the S477N B.1.526 variant and neutralize the E484K version with a modest 3.5-fold decrease in titer compared to D614G. The E484K version was neutralized with a 12-fold decrease in titer by the REGN10933 monoclonal antibody  but the combination cocktail with REGN10987 was fully active. The findings suggest that current vaccines and Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will remain protective against the B.1.526 variants. The findings further support the value of widespread vaccination.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its subunits are the most attractive targets for the development of protein-based vaccines. In this study  we evaluated three lipophilic adjuvants  monophosphoryl lipid A  MPLA   Toll-like receptor  TLR  1 2 ligand Pam 3 CSK 4   and α-galactosylceramide  α-GalCer   in liposomal and nonliposomal vaccines. The immunological results showed that the MPLA-adjuvanted liposomal vaccine induced the strongest humoral and cellular immunity. Therefore  we further performed a systematic comparison of S-trimer  S-ECD  S1  and RBD as antigens in MPLA-adjuvanted liposomes and found that  although these four vaccines all induced robust specific antibody responses  only S-trimer  S1  and RBD liposomes  but not S-ECD  elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses. Moreover  RBD  S-trimer  and S1 liposomes effectively neutralized variants  B.1.1.7 alpha  B.1.351 beta  P.1 gamma  B.1.617.2 delta  and B.1.1.529 omicron . These results provide important information for the subunit vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

The previous most prevalent lineages in the state of Rio Grande do Sul  RS  Southern Brazil   B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33  were rapidly replaced by P.1 and P.2  two B.1.1.28-derived lineages harboring the E484K mutation. To perform a genomic characterization from the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre  we sequenced viral samples to:  i  identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the region  the state  and bordering countries regions;  ii  characterize the mutation spectra;  iii  hypothesize viral dispersal routes by using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. We found that 96.4% of the samples belonged to the P.1 lineage and approximately 20% of them were assigned as the novel P.1.2  a P.1-derived sublineage harboring signature substitutions recently described in other Brazilian states and foreign countries. Moreover  sequences from this study were allocated in distinct branches of the P.1 phylogeny  suggesting multiple introductions in RS and placing this state as a potential diffusion core of P.1-derived clades and the emergence of P.1.2. It is uncertain whether the emergence of P.1.2 and other P.1 clades is related to clinical or epidemiological consequences. However  the clear signs of molecular diversity from the recently introduced P.1 warrant further genomic surveillance.

During August-November 2021  a series of Emergency Use Authorizations and recommendations  including those for an additional primary dose for immunocompromised persons and a booster dose for persons aged ≥18 years  were approved because of reduced immunogenicity in immunocompromised persons  waning vaccine effectiveness over time  and the introduction of the highly transmissible B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  4 5 . Adults aged ≥65 years are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death and were one of the populations first recommended a booster dose in the U.S.  5 6 . Data on COVID-19 vaccinations reported to CDC from 50 states  the District of Columbia  DC   and eight territories and freely associated states were analyzed to ascertain coverage with booster or additional primary doses among adults aged ≥65 years. During August 13-November 19  2021  18.7 million persons aged ≥65 years received a booster or additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine  constituting 44.1% of 42.5 million eligible* persons in this age group who previously completed a primary vaccination series. Coverage was similar by sex and age group  but varied by primary series vaccine product and race and ethnicity  ranging from 30.3% among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons to 50.5% among non-Hispanic multiple other race persons. Strategic efforts are needed to encourage eligible persons aged ≥18 years  especially those aged ≥65 years and those who are immunocompromised  to receive a booster and or additional primary dose to ensure maximal protection against COVID-19.

The beta variant  B.1.351 lineage   the mutation lineages of SARS-CoV-2  had increase transmissibility and resistance to neutralizing antibodies due to multiple mutations in the spike protein. N501Y  K417N and E484K  in the receptor binding domain  RBD  region may induce a conformational change of the spike protein and subsequently increase the infectivity of the beta variant. The L452R mutation in the epsilon variant  the B.1.427 B.1.429 variants  also reduced neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies. In this study  we discovered that 300 μg mL GB-2  from Tian Shang Sheng Mu of Chiayi Puzi Peitian Temple  can inhibit the binding between ACE2 and wild-type  Wuhan type  RBD spike protein. GB-2 can inhibit the binding between ACE2 and RBD with K417N-E484K-N501Y mutation in a dose-dependent manner. GB-2 inhibited the binding between ACE2 and the RBD with a single mutation  K417N or N501Y or L452R  except the E484K mutation. In the compositions of GB-2  glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC.  theaflavin and  + -catechin cannot inhibit the binding between ACE2 and wild-type RBD spike protein. Theaflavin 3-gallate can inhibit the binding between ACE2 and wild-type RBD spike protein. Our results suggest that GB-2 could be a potential candidate for the prophylaxis of some SARS-CoV-2 variants infection in the further clinical study because of its inhibition of binding between ACE2 and RBD with K417N-E484K-N501Y mutations or L452R mutation.

These mutations cluster within three functionally important regions of the S-gene at sites that will likely impact  i  interactions between subunits of the Spike trimer and the predisposition of subunits to shift from down to up configurations   ii  interactions of Spike with ACE2 receptors  and  iii  the priming of Spike for membrane fusion. We show here that  based on both the rarity of these 13 mutations in intrapatient sequencing reads and patterns of selection at the codon sites where the mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses  prior to the emergence of Omicron the mutations would have been predicted to decrease the fitness of any genomes within which they occurred. We further propose that the mutations in each of the three clusters therefore cooperatively interact to both mitigate their individual fitness costs  and adaptively alter the function of Spike. Given the evident epidemic growth advantages of Omicron over all previously known SARS-CoV-2 lineages  it is crucial to determine both how such complex and highly adaptive mutation constellations were assembled within the Omicron S-gene  and why  despite unprecedented global genomic surveillance efforts  the early stages of this assembly process went completely undetected.

Here  we evaluated the performance of the VITROS Antigen test  an enzyme immunoassay detecting a SARS-CoV-2 antigen  in NPSs from 3 cohorts of patients. METHODS: : Three cohorts including SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive samples collected during the first and second wave of the French epidemic between March 2020 and February 2021  including variant B.1.1.7 α and variant B.1.351 β . RESULTS: : Among the 1763 prospectively tested subjects  8.2%  145 1763  were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive by RT-PCR. Using Ct ≤ 30 and Ct ≤ 35 as thresholds  the sensitivities of the antigen assay were 98.8%  93.6–100%  and 93.5%  87.0–97.3%   respectively. The overall specificity of the assay was 100%  1614 1614; 99.8–100% . In a retrospective cohort of subjects infected with variants of concern  90.4%  47 52  of NPSs containing B. B.1.1.7 α  Ct ≤ 35  and 100%  7 7  of those containing B.1.351 β were positive with the VITROS EIA SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test. CONCLUSION: : The excellent performance of the EIA Antigen test reported here  including in patients infected with viral “variants of concern”  support the use of high-throughput  EIA-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays as an alternative or complement to nucleic acid testing in order to scale-up laboratory screening and diagnostic capacities.

In this work  the B.1+L249S+E484K lineage was isolated along with A.1  B.1.420 and B.1.111 SARS-CoV-2 lineages without the E484K mutation and the neutralizing titer of convalescent sera was compared using microneutralization assays. While no significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers were found between A1 and B lineages without the E484K mutation  the neutralizing titers against B.1+L249S+E484K were 1.5  1.9  2.1  and 1.3-fold lower than against A.1  B.1.420  B.1.111-I  and B.1.111-II  respectively. However  molecular epidemiological data indicate that there is no increase in the transmissibility rate associated with this new lineage. This study supports the capability of new variants with the E484K mutation to be resistant to neutralization by humoral immunity  and therefore the need to intensify surveillance programs to determine if these lineages represent a risk for the public health.

Studies of vaccine effectiveness  VE  for preventing new infections and hospitalizations attributable to SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19   particularly as the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant has become predominant  are limited in the United States  3 . In this study  the New York State Department of Health linked statewide immunization  laboratory testing  and hospitalization databases for New York to estimate rates of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by vaccination status among adults  as well as corresponding VE for full vaccination in the population  across all three authorized vaccine products. During May 3-July 25  2021  the overall age-adjusted VE against new COVID-19 cases for all adults declined from 91.7% to 79.8%. During the same period  the overall age-adjusted VE against hospitalization was relatively stable  ranging from 91.9% to 95.3%. Currently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization  but effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months  coinciding with the Delta variant's increase from <2% to >80% in the U.S. region that includes New York and relaxation of masking and physical distancing recommendations. To reduce new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations  these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination  as well as other prevention strategies such as masking and physical distancing.

Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use. METHODS: In this phase 2a b  multicenter  randomized  observer-blinded  placebo-controlled trial in South Africa  healthy human immunodeficiency virus  HIV -negative adults  18 to 84 years  or medically stable people living with HIV  PLWH   18 to 84 years  were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses  administered 21 days apart  of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine  5 μg recombinant spike protein with 50 μg Matrix-M1 adjuvant  or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy ≥7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants. RESULTS: A total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once  2199 with NVX-CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants  94% HIV-negative; 6% PLWH   15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases were noted in NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients  respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4%  95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8 . Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1%  95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1  and did not differ by baseline serostatus; 38  92.7%  of 41 sequenced cases were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0%  95% CI: −0.6 to 76.2  in HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient  and higher with NVX-CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19  which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant.

SARS-Cov-2 variants of concern  VOC  exhibiting greater transmissibility  and potentially increased risk of hospitalization  severity and mortality  are attributed to molecular mutations in outer viral surface spike proteins. Thus  there is a reliance on using appropriate counter-disease measures including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination. Best evidence suggests that use of frontline biocides effectively inactivate coronavirus similarly  including VOC  such as 202012 01  501Y.V2 and P.1 that have rapidly replaced the wild-type variant in the United Kingdom  South Africa and Brazil  respectively. However  this review highlights that efficacy of VOC-disinfection will depend on type of biocide and parameters governing activity. VOC are likely to be similar in size to the wild-type strain  thus implying that existing guidelines for use and re-use of face masks post disinfection remain relevant. Monitoring to avoid injudicious use of biocides during COVID-19 era is required as prolonged and excessive biocide usage may negatively impact our receiving environments; thus  highlighting the potential for alternative more environmental-friendly sustainable biocide solutions. Traditional biocides may promote cross-antimicrobial resistance  AMR  to antibiotics in problematical bacteria. Existing filtration efficacy of face masks is likely to perform similarly for VOC due to similar viral size; however  advances in face mask manufacturing by way incorporating new anti-viral materials will potentially enhance their design and functionality for existing and potentially future pandemics.

Emerging variants of concern  such as the B.1.617.2  delta  variant  are increasingly responsible for breakthrough infections due to their higher transmissibility and partial immune escape. Longitudinal data on neutralization against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant are urgently needed to guide vaccination strategies. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study  anti-S1 IgG and neutralizing surrogate antibodies were measured in 234 collected samples from 60 health care workers after two-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 at five different time points over an 8-month period. In addition  antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 epitopes  neutralization against wild-type  and cross-neutralization against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant using a live virus assay were measured 6 weeks  second time point  and 8 months  last time point  after first vaccine dose. RESULTS: Median  IQR  anti-S1 IgG  surrogate neutralizing  and receptor-binding domain antibodies decreased significantly from a maximum level of 147  102–298   97  96–98   and 20 159  19 023–21 628  to 8  4–13   92  80–96   and 15 324  13 055–17 288  at the 8-month follow-up  respectively  P<0.001 for all . Neutralization against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant was detectable in 36 36  100%  participants 6 weeks and in 50 53  94%  participants 8 months after first vaccine dose. Median  IQR  ID 50  as determined by a live virus assay decreased from 160  80–320  to 40  20–40   P<0.001 . CONCLUSIONS: Although humoral immunity wanes over time after two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination in healthy individuals  most individuals still had detectable neutralizing activity against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant after 8 months.

Sera from participants immunized on a prime-boost schedule with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine were tested for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants  including variants of concern  VOCs  and variants of interest  VOIs   compared to neutralization of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus  designated D614G . Results showed minimal  statistically nonsignificant effects on neutralization titers against the B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant  1.2-fold reduction compared with D614G ; other VOCs  such as B.1.351  Beta  including B.1.351-v1  B.1.351-v2  and B.1.351-v3   P.1  Gamma   and B.1.617.2  Delta   showed significantly decreased neutralization titers ranging from 2.1-fold to 8.4-fold reductions compared with D614G  although all remained susceptible to mRNA-1273-elicited serum neutralization. IMPORTANCE In light of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have been documented globally during the COVID-19 pandemic  it remains important to continually assess the ability of currently available vaccines to confer protection against newly emerging variants. Data presented herein indicate that immunization with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine produces neutralizing antibodies against key emerging variants tested  including variants of concern and variants of interest. While the serum neutralization elicited by mRNA-1273 against most variants tested was reduced compared with that against the wild-type virus  the level of neutralization is still expected to be protective. Such data are crucial to inform ongoing and future vaccination strategies to combat COVID-19.

METHODS: This is a prospective  monocentric  longitudinal  cohort clinical study. Healthcare workers  HCW  from Strasbourg University Hospital were enrolled between April 6th and May 7th  2020 and followed up to 422 days. Serial serum samples were tested for antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  of the spike protein and nucleocapsid protein  N  to characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the incidence of reinfection. Live-neutralization assays were performed for a subset of samples before and after vaccination to analyze sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 variants. FINDINGS: A total of 4290 samples from 393 convalescent COVID-19 and 916 COVID-19 negative individuals were analyzed. In convalescent individuals  SARS-CoV-2 antibodies followed a triphasic kinetic model with half-lives at month  M  11–13 of 283 days  95% CI 231–349  for anti-N and 725 days  95% CI 623–921  for anti-RBD IgG  which stabilized at a median of 1.54 log BAU mL  95% CI 1.42–1.67 . The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 12.22 and 0.40 per 100 person-years in COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive HCW  respectively  indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%. Live-virus neutralization assay revealed that after one year  variants D614G and B.1.1.7  but less so B.1.351  were sensitive to anti-RBD antibodies at 1.4 log BAU mL  while IgG ≥ 2.0 log BAU mL strongly neutralized all three variants. These latter anti-RBD IgG titers were reached by all vaccinated HCW regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels and type of vaccine. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates a long-term persistence of anti-RBD antibodies that may reduce risk of reinfection. By significantly increasing cross-neutralizing antibody titers  a single-dose vaccination strengthens protection against variants.

The frequent emergence of immune escape variants have spurred the search for prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we show that the bivalency of an affinity maturated fully human single-domain antibody  n3113.1-Fc  exhibits exquisite neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus  and confers effective prophylactic and therapeutic protection against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  humanized mice. The crystal structure of n3113 in complex with the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2  combined with the cryo-EM structures of n3113 and spike ecto-domain  reveals that n3113 binds to the side surface of up-state RBD with no competition with ACE2. The binding of n3113 to this novel epitope stabilizes spike in up-state conformations but inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S mediated membrane fusion  expanding our recognition of neutralization by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Binding assay and pseudovirus neutralization assay show no evasion of recently prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages  including Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   and Delta  B.1.617.2  for n3113.1-Fc with Y58L mutation  demonstrating the potential of n3113.1-Fc  Y58L  as a promising candidate for clinical development to treat COVID-19.

B.1.1.7 is a recently emerged variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has several mutations in the gene encoding for the spike-protein. To assess the potential effect these mutations could have on the neutralising efficacy of antibodies  we evaluated 96 serum samples from convalescent plasma donors collected before the first occurrence of B.1.1.7 and tested their neutralising effect on wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7. We found that B.1.1.7 is more resistant to neutralisation by convalescent plasma from patients infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with an overall decrease in neutralising activity of 47.7%. Thus  the neutralising effect of convalescent plasma should be determined against the major circulating virus clades whenever possible to ensure the best possible therapeutic effect.

Immunocompromised adults are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes  2  and might not acquire the same level of protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as do immunocompetent adults  3 4 . To evaluate vaccine effectiveness  VE  among immunocompromised adults  data from the VISION Network* on hospitalizations among persons aged ≥18 years with COVID-19-like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states during January 17-September 5  2021 were analyzed. Using selected discharge diagnoses  VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization conferred by completing a 2-dose series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine ≥14 days before the index hospitalization date§  i.e.  being fully vaccinated  was evaluated using a test-negative design comparing 20 101 immunocompromised adults  10 564 [53%] of whom were fully vaccinated  and 69 116 immunocompetent adults  29 456 [43%] of whom were fully vaccinated . VE of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was lower among immunocompromised patients  77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-80%  than among immunocompetent patients  90%; 95% CI = 89%-91% . This difference persisted irrespective of mRNA vaccine product  age group  and timing of hospitalization relative to SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  B.1.617.2  Delta  variant predominance in the state of hospitalization. VE varied across immunocompromising condition subgroups  ranging from 59%  organ or stem cell transplant recipients  to 81%  persons with a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder . Immunocompromised persons benefit from mRNA COVID-19 vaccination but are less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes than are immunocompetent persons  and VE varies among immunocompromised subgroups. Immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should receive 3 doses and a booster  consistent with CDC recommendations  5   practice nonpharmaceutical interventions  and  if infected  be monitored closely and considered early for proven therapies that can prevent severe outcomes.

Vaccine breakthrough by a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain is a risk to global public health. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  by qPCR  quantitative polymerase chain reaction  for Wuhan-Hu1 and alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant. GATK  genome analysis toolkit  variants were filtered with allele fraction ≥80 and min read depth 30x. RESULTS: Viral sequencing revealed an infection cluster of 6 vaccinated patients infected with the delta  B.1.617.2  SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no history of vaccine breakthrough  this suggests the delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2  Moderna mRNA-1273  and Covaxin BBV152. CONCLUSIONS: Delta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  with previously described increased transmissibility over alpha variant and now  possible vaccine breakthrough.

These variants have several substitutions in the spike protein that affect receptor binding; they exhibit increased transmissibility and may be associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness. In the present work  we report the identification of a potential variant of interest  harboring the mutations T478K  P681H  and T732A in the spike protein  within the newly named lineage B.1.1.519  that rapidly outcompeted the preexisting variants in Mexico and has been the dominant virus in the country during the first trimester of 2021.

In this study  we sought to investigate the virological characteristics of the Omicron variant and compared it with the Delta variant which has dominated the world since mid-2021. Omicron variant replicated more slowly than the Delta variant in transmembrane serine protease 2  TMPRSS2 -overexpressing VeroE6  VeroE6 TMPRSS2  cells. Notably  the Delta variant replicated well in Calu3 cell line which has robust TMPRSS2 expression  while the Omicron variant replicated poorly in this cell line. Competition assay showed that Delta variant outcompeted Omicron variant in VeroE6 TMPRSS2 and Calu3 cells. To confirm the difference in entry pathway between the Omicron and Delta variants  we assessed the antiviral effect of bafilomycin A1  chloroquine  inhibiting endocytic pathway   and camostat  inhibiting TMPRSS2 pathway . Camostat potently inhibited the Delta variant but not the Omicron variant  while bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine could inhibit both Omicron and Delta variants. Moreover  the Omicron variant also showed weaker cell–cell fusion activity when compared with Delta variant in VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. Collectively  our results suggest that Omicron variant infection is not enhanced by TMPRSS2 but is largely mediated via the endocytic pathway. The difference in entry pathway between Omicron and Delta variants may have an implication on the clinical manifestations or disease severity.

Vaccination boosted pre-existing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies 10-fold in previously infected individuals  but not to levels significantly higher than those of uninfected vaccinees. However  neutralizing antibody titers increased in previously infected vaccinees relative to uninfected vaccinees against every variant tested: 5.2-fold against B.1.1.7  6.5-fold against B.1.351  4.3-fold against P.1  and 3.4-fold against original SARS-CoV-2. Our study indicates that a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine provides broad protection from SARS-CoV-2 variants in individuals with previous infection.

We report herewith the isolation of the P.2 variant  B.1.1.28.2  from international travelers and further its pathogenicity evaluation and comparison with D614G variant  B.1  in hamster model. METHODS: Virus isolation was performed in Vero CCL81 cells and genomic characterization by next generation sequencing. The pathogenicity and host immune response of the isolate was assessed in Syrian hamster model and compared with B.1 variant. RESULTS: B.1.1.28.2 variant was isolated from nasal throat swabs of international travelers returned to India from United Kingdom and Brazil. The B.1.1.28.2 variant induced body weight loss  viral replication in the respiratory tract and caused severe lung pathology in infected Syrian hamster model in comparison  with B.1 variant infected hamsters. The sera from B.1.1.28.2 infected hamsters efficiently neutralized the D614G variant virus whereas 6-fold reduction in the neutralization was seen in case of D614G variant infected hamsters’ sera with the B.1.1.28.2 variant. CONCLUSIONS: B.1.1.28.2 lineage variant could be successfully isolated and characterization could be performed. Pathogenicity of the isolate was demonstrated in Syrian hamster model and the findings of neutralization reduction is of great concern and point towards the need for screening the vaccines for efficacy.

Additional data were needed regarding the efficacy  immunogenicity  and safety of this vaccine in a larger population. METHODS: In this phase 3  randomized  observer-blinded  placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom  we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was virologically confirmed mild  moderate  or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically negative at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 15 187 participants underwent randomization  and 14 039 were included in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants  27.9% were 65 years of age or older  and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group  with a symptom onset of at least 7 days after the second injection  for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7%  95% confidence interval [CI]  80.2 to 94.6 . No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection were reported  all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed an efficacy of 86.3%  95% CI  71.3 to 93.5  against the B.1.1.7  or alpha  variant and 96.4%  95% CI  73.8 to 99.5  against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant.

Variants have the potential to affect transmission  disease severity  diagnostics  therapeutics  and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. In November 2020  CDC established national surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants using genomic sequencing. As of May 6  2021  sequences from 177 044 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens collected during December 20  2020-May 6  2021  from 55 U.S. jurisdictions had been generated by or reported to CDC. These included 3 275 sequences for the 2-week period ending January 2  2021  compared with 25 000 sequences for the 2-week period ending April 24  2021  0.1% and 3.1% of reported positive SARS-CoV-2 tests  respectively . Because sequences might be generated by multiple laboratories and sequence availability varies both geographically and over time  CDC developed statistical weighting and variance estimation methods to generate population-based estimates of the proportions of identified variants among SARS-CoV-2 infections circulating nationwide and in each of the 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  geographic regions.* During the 2-week period ending April 24  2021  the B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants represented an estimated 66.0% and 5.0% of U.S. SARS-CoV-2 infections  respectively  demonstrating the rise to predominance of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern  VOC  and emergence of the P.1 VOC in the United States. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance methods to analyze surveillance data produces timely population-based estimates of the proportions of variants circulating nationally and regionally. Surveillance findings demonstrate the potential for new variants to emerge and become predominant  and the importance of robust genomic surveillance. Along with efforts to characterize the clinical and public health impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants  surveillance can help guide interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible  but may also cause an increased mortality compared to previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. Human tissue analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is urgently needed  and we here present autopsy data from 7 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 cases. The initial RT-qPCR analyses from nasopharyngeal swabs taken post mortem included typing assays for B.1.1.7. We quantitated SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 viral load in autopsy tissue of multiple organs. Highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 copies normalized to ß-globin were detected in the respiratory system  lung and pharynx   followed by the liver and heart. Importantly  SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was found in 100% of cases in the lungs and in 85.7% in pharynx tissue. Detection also in the kidney and brain highlighting a pronounced organ tropism. Comparison of the given results to a former cohort of SARS-CoV-2 deaths during the first wave in spring 2020 showed resembling organ tropism. Our results indicate that also SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 has a relevant organ tropism beyond the respiratory tract. We speculate that B.1.1.7 spike protein’s affinity to human ACE2 facilitates transmission  organ tropism  and ultimately morbidity and mortality. Further studies and larger cohorts are obligatory to proof this link.

India accounts almost 10% of the total mortality. The mutated Variants of Concern  VoC  and Variants of Interest  VoI  has acquired non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in Spike  S   ORF1a  ORF1b  Nucleocapsid  N   Membrane  M   Envelope  E   ORF6  ORF7a  ORF3a and ORF8 regions exhibiting more virulence and higher transmission rate. The S gene displaying nucleotide polymorphisms are studied for identification of major SARS CoV-2 variants circulating in India using in silico PCR-RFLP analysis. Methods & Materials DNA sequences of major SARS CoV-2 variants [alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   delta  B.1.617.2   epsilon  B.1.429+B.1.427   eta  B.1.525  and zeta  P.2 ] prevailing in India retrieved from GISAID database were annotated using VIPR-VIGOR4 genome annotator tool. The S gene of variants were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm in MEGA-X with default parameters and analyzed for sequence identity using Geneious Prime v2019.2.1. Primers were designed using Primer-BLAST tool  proof-read using FastPCR v6.7.46 and PCR-amplified using Snapgene v.3.2.1. Unique restriction sites in S amplicons of each variant were subjected to online Restriction Analyzer tool. The S amplicons were digested with restriction endonucleases and the band profile of each variant were visualized in the gel simulation tool using Snapgene v.3.2.1. Results The percentage of identical sites present in S region among SARS CoV-2 variants was found to be 98.6%. The amplified products were in the length of 3 689 and 3 698 bp. Out of 400 restriction endonucleases identified  14 buffer-compatible enzymes were selected for single-step restriction digestion to generate unique RFLP profiles for each variant. The BsaXI-XcmI-AcuI triple digest showed unique banding pattern identifiers on 2% agarose gel for individual variants including alpha  eta  delta and zeta. The ApaLI-BsaI double digest produced distinct band profiles for beta and epsilon variants. Conclusion Our study strongly suggests PCR-RFLP analysis of Spike region can differentiate major SARS CoV-2 variants that are circulating in India. Further  quadruple digestion based wet lab experiments are underway to explore the possibility of surveillance of the major variants using a single-tube reaction followed by agarose gel-based profiling.

We aimed to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that jointly predict COVID-19 and investigated whether predictive symptoms differ between the B.1.1.7  Alpha  lineage  predominating as of April 2021 in the US  UK  and elsewhere  and wild type. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained throat and nose swabs with valid SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results from 1 147 370 volunteers aged 5 years and above  6 450 positive cases  in the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1  REACT-1  study. This study involved repeated community-based random surveys of prevalence in England  study rounds 2 to 8  June 2020 to January 2021  response rates 22%–27% . Participants were asked about symptoms occurring in the week prior to testing. Viral genome sequencing was carried out for PCR-positive samples with N-gene cycle threshold value < 34  N = 1 079  in round 8  January 2021 . In univariate analysis  all 26 surveyed symptoms were associated with PCR positivity compared with non-symptomatic people. Stability selection  1 000 penalized logistic regression models with 50% subsampling  among people reporting at least 1 symptom identified 7 symptoms as jointly and positively predictive of PCR positivity in rounds 2–7  June to December 2020 : loss or change of sense of smell  loss or change of sense of taste  fever  new persistent cough  chills  appetite loss  and muscle aches. The resulting model  rounds 2–7  predicted PCR positivity in round 8 with area under the curve  AUC  of 0.77. The same 7 symptoms were selected as jointly predictive of B.1.1.7 infection in round 8  although when comparing B.1.1.7 with wild type  new persistent cough and sore throat were more predictive of B.1.1.7 infection while loss or change of sense of smell was more predictive of the wild type. The main limitations of our study are  i  potential participation bias despite random sampling of named individuals from the National Health Service register and weighting designed to achieve a representative sample of the population of England and  ii  the necessary reliance on self-reported symptoms  which may be prone to recall bias and may therefore lead to biased estimates of symptom prevalence in England. CONCLUSIONS: Where testing capacity is limited  it is important to use tests in the most efficient way possible. We identified a set of 7 symptoms that  when considered together  maximize detection of COVID-19 in the community  including infection with the B.1.1.7 lineage.

Currently  there is no effective treatment for COVID-19 to reduce mortality. We investigated the potential anti-coronavirus activities from an oral liquid of traditional medicine  Respiratory Detox Shot  RDS   which contains mostly herbal ingredients traditionally used to manage lung diseases. RESULTS: Here we report that RDS inhibited the infection of target cells by lenti-SARS-CoV  lenti-SARS-CoV-2  and hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2  Ha-CoV-2  pseudoviruses  and by infectious SARS-CoV-2 and derived Ha-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.429  B.1.2  B.1.494  B.1.1.207  B.1.258  and B.1.1.298. We further demonstrated that RDS directly inactivates the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. In addition  we found that RDS can also block the infection of target cells by Influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RDS may broadly inhibit the infection of respiratory viruses.

In this study  we employed advanced biochemical and virological methodologies to evaluate the impact of Spike mutations of these strains on the degree of protection afforded by humoral immune responses following natural infection of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain during the early stages of the outbreak. We found that antibody-mediated neutralization activity was partially reduced for B.1.1.7 variant and significantly attenuated for the B.1.351 strain. We also found that mutations outside the receptor-binding domain  RBD  can strongly influence antibody binding and neutralization  cautioning the use of solely RBD mutations in evaluating vaccine efficacy. These findings highlight an urgent need to develop new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are not based exclusively on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene sequence.

It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities  eventually in part due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor  several in silico methods and numerous experimental data reported recently to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements  Spike K417N  E484K  N501Y  with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface  present in both the UK and South African strains  should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2  while the K417N and E484K substitutions  South African strain  would seem neutral or even unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the K417N and E484K Spike replacements with regard to ACE2 binding. Our finding suggests that the UK strain should have higher affinity toward ACE2 and therefore likely increased transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity. If indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level  this could be due to the N501Y replacement and or to substitutions in regions located outside the direct Spike–ACE2 interface but not so much to the K417N and E484K replacements. Yet  it should be noted that amino acid changes at Spike position 484 can lead to viral escape from neutralizing antibodies. Further  these amino acid substitutions do not seem to induce major structural changes in this region of the Spike protein. This structure–function study allows us to rationalize some observations made for the UK strain but raises questions for the South African strain.

On January 25  2021  MDH identified the SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 in one specimen through this surveillance system using whole genome sequencing  representing the first identified case of this variant in the United States. The P.1 variant was first identified in travelers from Brazil during routine airport screening in Tokyo  Japan  in early January 2021  1 . This variant has been associated with increased transmissibility  2   and there are concerns that mutations in the spike protein receptor-binding domain might disrupt both vaccine-induced and natural immunity  3 4 . As of February 28  2021  a total of 10 P.1 cases had been identified in the United States  including the two cases described in this report  followed by one case each in Alaska  Florida  Maryland  and Oklahoma  5 .

Invasive Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis have been established and recognized as complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such cases have been intimately linked and related to prior corticosteroid therapy. With the new highly infectious Delta strain  B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1  of the coronavirus which is running rampant throughout India causing unprecedented death tolls  a new crisis is evolving. Invasive “black fungus”  Mucormycosis  is creating an epidemic within a global pandemic. The unique socio-economic  genetic and health status of Indian population culminates into a melting pot which sustains the viable triad for the “black fungus” infection to gain a stronghold. Diabetes mellitus  immunosuppression and the current COVID-19 global pandemic with its massive surges in the country have produced the “perfect storm.” Ophthalmologist across India have reported a surge in invasive Mucormycosis cases with a rise in orbital compartment syndrome often calling for radical procedures such as enucleation surgeries. The “black fungus” pandemic and invasive Mucormycosis resulted in the sinister secondary infections and complications are closely linked with the COVID-19 infection in India. It is therefore of the upmost importance that neighbouring countries particularly Nepal and other Asiatic nations take great cognizance of this indolent “black fungus killer” and ensure new screening and testing protocols for early identification to ensure effective management.

A total of 453 genomic sequences of Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from GISAID and subjected to MAFFT-based alignment and QC check which resulted in removal of 53 samples. The remaining 400 samples were subjected to Pangolin-based genomic lineage identification. And to infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled and divergence phylogenetic trees  3804 selected global reference sequences plus 400 Pakistani samples were used for the Nextstrain analysis with Wuhan Hu-1 2019  as reference genome. Finally  maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree was built by using the Nextstrain and coverage map was created by employing Nextclade. By using the amino acid substitutions  the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were developed for each wave  separately. Our results reveal the circulation of 29 lineages  belonging to following seven clades G  GH  GR  GRY  L  O  and S in the three waves. From first wave  16 genomic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified with B.1 24.7%   B.1.36 18.8%   and B.1.471 18.8%  as the most prevalent lineages respectively. The second wave data showed 18 lineages  10 of which were overlapping with the first wave suggesting that those variants could not be contained during the first wave. In this wave  a new lineage  AE.4  was reported from Pakistan for the very first time in the world. However  B.1.36  17.8%   B.1.36.31  11.9%   B.1.1.7  8.5%   and B.1.1.1  5.9%  were the major lineages in second wave. Third wave data showed the presence of nine lineages with Alpha B.1.1.7  72.7%   Beta B.1.351  12.99%   and Delta B.1.617.2  10.39%  as the most predominant variants. It is suggested that these VOCs should be contained at the earliest in order to prevent any devastating outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.

We aimed to describe the severity of the alpha variant in terms of the pathway of disease from testing positive to hospital admission and death. METHODS: With the approval of NHS England  we linked individual-level data from primary care with SARS-CoV-2 community testing  hospital admission  and ONS all-cause death data. We used testing data with S-gene target failure as a proxy for distinguishing alpha and wild-type cases  and stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the relative severity of alpha cases compared to wild type diagnosed from 16th November 2020 to 11th January 2021. RESULTS: Using data from 185 234 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community  alpha=93 153; wild-type=92 081   in fully adjusted analysis accounting for individual-level demographics and comorbidities as well as regional variation in infection incidence  we found alpha associated with 73% higher hazards of all-cause death  aHR: 1.73  95% CI 1.41 - 2.13; P<.0001   and 62% higher hazards of hospital admission  aHR: 1.62   95% CI 1.48 - 1.78; P<.0001   compared to wild-type virus. Among patients already admitted to ICU  the association between alpha and increased all-cause mortality was smaller and the confidence interval included the null  aHR: 1.20  95% CI 0.74 - 1.95; P=0.45  . CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant is associated with an increased risk of both hospitalisation and mortality than wild-type virus.

Viral and host factors could contribute to variability within a host that can be captured in next-generation sequencing reads as intra-host single nucleotide variations  iSNVs . Analysing 1347 samples collected till June 2020  we recorded 16 410 iSNV sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found ∼42% of the iSNV sites to be reported as SNVs by 30 September 2020 in consensus sequences submitted to GISAID  which increased to ∼80% by 30th June 2021. Following this  analysis of another set of 1774 samples sequenced in India between November 2020 and May 2021 revealed that majority of the Delta  B.1.617.2  and Kappa  B.1.617.1  lineage-defining variations appeared as iSNVs before getting fixed in the population. Besides  mutations in RdRp as well as RNA-editing by APOBEC and ADAR deaminases seem to contribute to the differential prevalence of iSNVs in hosts. We also observe hyper-variability at functionally critical residues in Spike protein that could alter the antigenicity and may contribute to immune escape. Thus  tracking and functional annotation of iSNVs in ongoing genome surveillance programs could be important for early identification of potential variants of concern and actionable interventions.
doi:10.3389/fpubh.2021.775224,The Disease Severity and Clinical Outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,doi:10.3389/fpubh.2021.775224,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.775224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34917580/,pubmed:34917580,pmc:PMC8669511,Front Public Health,2021,The Disease Severity and Clinical Outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,With the continuation of the pandemic  many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants have appeared around the world. Owing to a possible risk of increasing the transmissibility of the virus  severity of the infected individuals  and the ability to escape the antibody produced by the vaccines  the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   and Delta  B.1.617.2  have attracted the most widespread attention. At present  there is a unified conclusion that these four variants have increased the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2  but the severity of the disease caused by them has not yet been determined. Studies from June 1  2020 to October 15  2021 were considered  and a meta-analysis was carried out to process the data. Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta variants are all more serious than the wild-type virus in terms of hospitalization  ICU admission  and mortality  and the Beta and Delta variants have a higher risk than the Alpha and Gamma variants. Notably  the random effects of Beta variant to the wild-type virus with respect to hospitalization rate  severe illness rate  and mortality rate are 2.16  95% CI: 1.19–3.14   2.23  95% CI: 1.31–3.15   and 1.50  95% CI: 1.26–1.74   respectively  and the random effects of Delta variant to the wild-type virus are 2.08  95% CI: 1.77–2.39   3.35  95% CI: 2.5–4.2   and 2.33  95% CI: 1.45–3.21   respectively. Although  the emergence of vaccines may reduce the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants  these are still very important  especially the Beta and Delta variants.

SARS-CoV-2 is still adapting to humans and  as illustrated by B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.617.2  Delta   lineage dynamics are fluid  and strain prevalence may change radically in a matter of months. The National Institutes of Health's Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics  RADx SM   initiative created a Variant Task Force to assess the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on in vitro diagnostic testing. Working in tandem with clinical laboratories  the FDA  and the CDC  the Variant Task Force uses both in silico modeling and in vitro testing to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on diagnostic molecular and antigen tests. Here  we offer an overview of the approach and activities of the RADx Variant Task Force to ensure test performance against emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles  SC2-VLPs   we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed 3-fold higher capsid assembly and cell entry relative to Delta  a property conferred by S and N protein mutations. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer BioNTech  Moderna  Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron  resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in 8 out of 8 subjects compared to 1 out of 8 pre-boost. Furthermore  the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1  B.1.1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs. Our results suggest that Omicron is more efficient at assembly and cell entry compared to Delta  and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection  at least prior to boost  will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron. In addition  some currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients.

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme2  ACE2  is the most important of these receptors  little is known about the contribution of other genes. In this study  we examined the roles of neuropilin-1  basigin  transmembrane serine proteases  TMPRSSs   and cathepsins  CTSs  in SARS-CoV-2 infection using the CRISPR interference system and ACE2-expressing human iPS cells. Double-knockdown of TMPRSS2 and CTSB reduced the viral load to 0.036±0.021%. Consistently  the combination of the CTPB inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester and the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat reduced the viral load to 0.0078±0.0057%. This result was confirmed using four SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.3  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.1.248 . The simultaneous use of these two drugs reduced viral load to less than 0.01% in both female and male iPS cells. These findings suggest that compounds targeting TMPRSS2 and CTSB exhibit highly efficient antiviral effects independent of gender and SARS-CoV-2 variant.

Despite multiple studies reporting molecular evidence suggestive of its circulation in Brazil  much is still unknown about its genomic diversity in the state of São Paulo  the main Brazilian economic and transportation hub. To get more insight regarding its transmission dynamics into the State we performed phylogenetic analysis on all alpha VOC strains obtained between February and August 2021 from the Sao Paulo state Network for Pandemic Alert of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The performed phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the alpha VOC genomes were interspersed with viral strains sampled from different Brazilian states and other countries suggesting that multiple independent Alpha VOC introductions from Brazil and overseas have occurred in the São Paulo State over time. Nevertheless  large monophyletic clusters were also observed especially from the Central-West part of the São Paulo State  the city of Bauru  and the metropolitan region of the São Paulo city. Our results highlight the Alpha VOC molecular epidemiology in the São Paulo state and reinforce the need for continued genomic surveillance strategies for the real-time monitoring of potential emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants during the ever-growing vaccination process.

A broadly neutralizing reagent against these concerning variants is thus highly desirable for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We herein report a covalent engineering strategy on protein minibinders for potent neutralization of the escaping variants such as B.1.617.2  Delta   B.1.617.1  Kappa   and B.1.1.529  Omicron  through in situ cross-linking with the spike receptor binding domain  RBD . The resulting covalent minibinder  GlueBinder  exhibited enhanced blockage of RBD-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  huACE2  interaction and more potent neutralization effect against the Delta variant than its noncovalent counterpart as demonstrated on authentic virus. By leveraging the covalent chemistry against escaping mutations  our strategy may be generally applicable for restoring and enhancing the potency of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and other rapidly evolving viral targets.

Monoclonal neutralizing antibodies are an important drug class in the global fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to their ability to convey immediate protection and their potential to be used as both prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. Clinically used neutralizing antibodies against respiratory viruses are currently injected intravenously  which can lead to suboptimal pulmonary bioavailability and thus to a lower effectiveness. Here we describe DZIF-10c  a fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody that binds the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. DZIF-10c displays an exceptionally high neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2  retains full activity against the variant of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7 and still neutralizes the VOC B.1.351  although with reduced potency. Importantly  not only systemic but also intranasal application of DZIF-10c abolished the presence of infectious particles in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice and mitigated lung pathology when administered prophylactically. Along with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile  these results highlight DZIF-10c as a novel human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody with high in vitro and in vivo antiviral potency. The successful intranasal application of DZIF-10c paves the way for clinical trials investigating topical delivery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The Spike protein that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells is a major target for COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapeutics. However  multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged  which may potentially compromise vaccine effectiveness. Using a pseudovirus-based assay  we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediated by the viral Spike B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 variants. We also compared the neutralization ability of monoclonal antibodies from convalescent sera and neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  elicited by CoronaVac  inactivated vaccine  and ZF2001  RBD-subunit vaccine  against B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 variants. Our results showed that  compared to D614G and B.1.1.7 variants  B.1.617 shows enhanced viral entry and membrane fusion  as well as more resistant to antibody neutralization. These findings have important implications for understanding viral infectivity and for immunization policy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However  SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein have emerged in many countries. To evaluate the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies induced in convalescent patients against emerging variants  we isolate anti-Spike mAbs from two convalescent patients with COVID-19 infected with prototypic SARS-CoV-2 by single cell sorting of IgG+ memory B cells. Anti-Spike antibody induction is robust in these patients and five mAbs have potent neutralizing activities. The efficacy of most neutralizing mAbs and convalescent plasma samples is maintained against B.1.1.7 and mink cluster 5 variants but is significantly decreased against variants B.1.351 from South Africa and P.1 from Brazil. However  mAbs with a high affinity to the receptor-binding domain remain effective against these neutralization-resistant variants. Rapid spread of these variants significantly impacts antibody-based therapies and vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern  VOC   including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study  samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9  2020  for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20  2020  in London  UK  were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease  defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test  and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy  using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria  341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198  58%  of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143  42%  had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage  B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7  in unadjusted analyses  prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72–1·31]   or in analyses adjusted for hospital  sex  age  comorbidities  and ethnicity  adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76–1·38] . We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples  as measured by cycle threshold value  mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085  and genomic read depth  1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011 . INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7  and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an association of the variant with severe disease in this hospitalised cohort.

Genomic data is key in understanding the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and informing the design and evaluation of interventions. However  SARS-CoV-2 genomic data remains scarce across Africa  with no reports yet from the Indian Ocean islands. Methods. We genome sequenced six SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from the first major infection wave in the Union of Comoros in January 2021 and undertook detailed phylogenetic analysis. Results. All the recovered six genomes classified within the 501Y.V2 variant of concern  also known as lineage B.1.351  and appeared to be from 2 sub-clusters with the most recent common ancestor dated 30  th  Oct-2020  95% Credibility Interval: 06  th  Sep-2020 to 10  th  Dec-2020 . Comparison of the Comoros genomes with those of 501Y.V2 variant of concern from other countries deposited into the GISAID database revealed their close association with viruses identified in France and Mayotte  part of the Comoros archipelago and a France  Overseas Department . Conclusions. The recovered genomes  albeit few  confirmed local transmission following probably multiple introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant of concern during the Comoros’s first major COVID-19 wave. These findings demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance and have implications for ongoing control strategies on the islands.

Genomic and laboratory surveillance are important to determine if these variants may be more infectious or less susceptible to antiviral treatments and vaccine-induced antibodies. Three of the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in Colombia during the epidemiological peaks of 2021 were isolated: Mu  a variant of interest; Gamma  a variant of concern; B.1.111  which lacks genetic markers associated with greater virulence. Microneutralization assays were performed by incubating 120 mean tissue culture infectious doses  TCID50  of each SARS-CoV-2 isolate with five two-fold serial dilutions of sera from 31 BNT162b2-vaccinated volunteers. The mean neutralization titer  MN50  was calculated by the Reed–Muench method. At the end of August  Mu represented 49% of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  cases in Colombia  followed by 25% of Gamma. In contrast  B.1.111 became almost undetectable. The evaluation of neutralizing antibodies suggests that patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 generate neutralizing antibody titers against the Mu variant at significantly lower concentrations relative to B.1.111 and Gamma. This study shows the importance of continuing surveillance programs of emerging variants  as well as the need to evaluate the neutralizing antibody response induced by other vaccines.

In February 2021  we noticed in Southern Finland coronavirus disease 2019 cases where two commercial polymerase chain reaction  PCR  analyses failed to recognize the used N gene target but recognized the other target gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Complete viral genome sequence analysis of the strains revealed several mutations that were not found at that time in public databases. A short 3 bp deletion and three subsequent single nucleotide polymorphisms in the N gene were found exactly at the site where an early published and widely used N gene‐based PCR primer is located  explaining the negative results in the N gene PCR. Later the variant strain was identified as a member of the B.1.1.318 Pango lineage that had first been found from Nigerian samples collected in January 2021. This strain shares with the Beta variant the S gene E484K mutation linked to impaired vaccine protection  but differs from this variant in several other ways  for example by deletions in the N gene region. Mutations in the N gene causing diagnostic resistance and on the other hand E484K mutation in the causing altered infectivity warrants careful inspection on virus variants that might get underdiagnosed.

Here we confirm that neutralizing and binding antibody responses to Ad26.COV2.S vaccination are stable for 6 months post-vaccination  when tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Secondly  using longitudinal samples from individuals who experienced clinically mild breakthrough infections 4 to 5 months after vaccination  we show dramatically boosted binding antibodies  Fc effector function and neutralization. These high titer responses are of similar magnitude to humoral immune responses measured in convalescent donors who had been hospitalized with severe illness  and are cross-reactive against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants  including the neutralization resistant Omicron  B.1.1.529  variant that currently dominates global infections  as well as SARS-CoV-1. These data have implications for population immunity in areas where the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been widely deployed  but where ongoing infections continue to occur at high levels.

The recently emerged B.1.617.2 Delta variant of concern is closely associated with the COVID-19 surge that occurred in India in the spring of 2021  ref.  2  . However  the virological properties of B.1.617.2 Delta remain unclear. Here we show that the B.1.617.2 Delta variant is highly fusogenic and notably more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein  which is highly conserved in this lineage  facilitates cleavage of the spike protein and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover  we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity compared with its parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark of the virological phenotype of the B.1.617.2 Delta variant and is associated with enhanced pathogenicity.

Here we show that T-cell responses in individuals with prior infection  vaccination  both prior infection and vaccination  and boosted vaccination are largely preserved to Omicron spike and non-spike proteins. However  we also identify a subset of individuals  ∼21%  with a >50% reduction in T-cell reactivity to the Omicron spike. Evaluation of functional CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses confirmed these findings and reveal that reduced recognition to Omicron spike is primarily observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment potentially due to escape from HLA binding. Booster vaccination enhanced T-cell responses to Omicron spike. In contrast to neutralizing immunity  these findings suggest preservation of T-cell responses to the Omicron variant  although with reduced reactivity in some individuals.

To address this issue  all publications relevant to the effectiveness of vaccines against the Delta variant were searched in the Web of Science  Scopus  EMBASE  and Medline  via PubMed  databases up to 15 October 2021. A total of 15 studies  36 datasets  were included in the meta-analysis. After the first dose  the VE against the Delta variant for each vaccine was 0.567  95% CI 0.520–0.613  for Pfizer-BioNTech  0.72  95% CI 0.589–0.822  for Moderna  0.44  95% CI 0.301–0.588  for AstraZeneca  and 0.138  95% CI 0.076–0.237  for CoronaVac. Meta-analysis of 2 375 957 vaccinated cases showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had the highest VE against the infection after the second dose  at 0.837  95% CI 0.672–0.928   and third dose  at 0.972  95% CI 0.96–0.978   as well as the highest VE for the prevention of severe infection or death  at 0.985  95% CI 0.95–0.99   amongst all COVID-19 vaccines. The short-term effectiveness of vaccines  especially mRNA-based vaccines  for the prevention of the Delta variant infection  hospitalization  severe infection  and death is supported by this study. Limitations include a lack of long-term efficacy data  and under-reporting of COVID-19 infection cases in observational studies  which has the potential to falsely skew VE rates. Overall  this study supports the decisions by public health decision makers to promote the population vaccination rate to control the Delta variant infection and the emergence of further variants.

During this COVID-19 pandemic  several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been found. Some of these new variants like the VOC-202012 01 of lineage B.1.1.7 or the most recently B.1.617 emerging in India have a higher infectiousness than those previously prevalent. We propose a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations to investigate potential consequences of the appearance of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain in a given region. The proposed mathematical model incorporates the presymptomatic and asymptomatic subpopulations in addition to the more usual susceptible  exposed  infected  and recovered subpopulations. This is important from a realistic point of view since it has been found recently that presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are relevant spreaders of the SARS-CoV-2. Using the next-generation matrix method  we find the basic reproduction number  [Formula: see text]   an important threshold parameter that provides insight regarding the evolution and outcome of a certain instance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The local and global stability of system equilibria are also presented. In particular  for the global stability we construct a Lyapunov functional and use the LaSalle invariant principle to prove that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than unity  the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. On the other hand  if [Formula: see text] the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Finally  we present numerical simulations to numerically support the analytic results and to show the impact of the introduction of a new more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population.

As emerging variants of concern  VOCs  displace the initially circulating strains  it is crucial that RATs do not fail to detect these new variants. In this study  four RATs for nasal swab testing were investigated using cultured strains of B.1.1  non-VOC   B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma   and B.1.617.2  Delta . Based on dilution series in cell culture medium and pooled saliva  the limit of detection of these RATs was determined in a laboratory setting. Further investigations on cross-reactivity were conducted using recombinant N-protein from seasonal human coronaviruses  hCoVs . RATs evaluated showed an overall comparable performance with cultured strains of the non-VOC B.1.1 and the VOCs Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta. No cross-reactivity was detected with recombinant N-protein of the hCoV strains HKU1  OC43  NL63  and 229E. A continuous evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RAT performance is required  especially with regard to evolving mutations. Moreover  cross-reactivity and interference with pathogens and other substances on the test performance of RATs should be consistently investigated to ensure suitability in the context of SARS-CoV-2 containment.

There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors  Ad  of human and chimpanzee origin  we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing Spike-1  Nucleocapsid and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization  particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine  is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses  mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.

This study shows high seroconversion after one vaccine dose  but also suggests that one vaccine dose may be insufficient to protect against emerging variants.

We studied the disease characteristics induced by the Delta AY.1 variant and compared it with the Delta and B.1 variants in Syrian hamsters. We also assessed the potential of re-infection by these variants in Coronavirus disease 2019 recovered hamsters 3 months after initial infection. The variants produced disease characterized by high viral load in the respiratory tract and interstitial pneumonia. The Delta AY.1 variant produced mild disease in the hamster model and did not show any evidence of neutralization resistance due to the presence of the K417N mutation  as speculated. Re-infection with a high virus dose of the Delta and B.1 variants 3 months after B.1 variant infection resulted in reduced virus shedding  disease severity and increased neutralizing antibody levels in the re-infected hamsters. The reduction in viral load and lung disease after re-infection with the Delta AY.1 variant was not marked. Upper respiratory tract viral RNA loads remained similar after re-infection in all the groups. The present findings show that prior infection could not produce sterilizing immunity but that it can broaden the neutralizing response and reduce disease severity in case of reinfection.

In this study  we report a novel variant carrying the L452R mutation that emerged from a local B.1.362 lineage  B.1.362+L452R. The L452R mutation is associated with the Delta and Epsilon variants and was shown to cause increased infection and reduction in neutralization in pseudoviruses. Indeed  the B.1.362+L452R variant demonstrated a X4-fold reduction in neutralization capacity of sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals compared to a wild-type strain. The variant infected 270 individuals in Israel between December 2020 and March 2021  until diminishing due to the gain in dominance of the Alpha variant in February 2021. This study demonstrates an independent  local emergence of a variant carrying a critical mutation  L452R  which may have the potential of becoming a variant of concern and emphasizes the importance of routine surveillance and detection of novel variants among efforts undertaken to prevent further disease spread.

While vaccines effectively prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death  vaccine breakthrough infections increasingly occur. The precise role of clinical and genomic determinants in Delta infections is not known  and whether they contribute to increased rates of breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated controls. Here  we show a steep and near complete replacement of circulating variants with Delta between May and August 2021 in metropolitan New York. We observed an increase of the Delta sublineage AY.25  its spike mutation S112L  and nsp12 mutation F192V in breakthroughs. Delta infections were associated with younger age and lower hospitalization rates than Alpha. Delta breakthroughs increased significantly with time since vaccination  and  after adjusting for confounders  they rose at similar rates as in unvaccinated individuals. Our data indicate a limited impact of vaccine escape in favor of Delta’s increased epidemic growth in times of waning vaccine protection.

We gathered publicly available data from GISAID and sequenced 1927 new genomes sampled periodically from March 2021 to June 2021 from 91 out of the 92 cities of the state. Our results showed that the pandemic was characterized by three different phases driven by a successive replacement of lineages. Interestingly  we noticed that viral supercarriers accounted for the overwhelming majority of the circulating virus  >90%  among symptomatic individuals in the state. Moreover  SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance also revealed the emergence and spread of two new variants  P.5 and P.1.2   firstly reported in this study. Our findings provided important lessons learned from the different epidemiological aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 dynamic in Rio de Janeiro. Altogether  this might have a strong potential to shape future decisions aiming to improve public health management and understanding mechanisms underlying virus dispersion.

A safe  effective  and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections diseases is urgently needed. We have been developing a recombinant vaccine based on a prefusion-stabilized spike trimer of SARS-CoV-2 and formulated with aluminium hydroxide and CpG 7909. The spike protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary  CHO  cells  purified  and prepared as a stable formulation with the dual adjuvant. Immunogenicity studies showed that candidate vaccines elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses and substantial CD4 +  T cell responses in both mice and non-human primates. And vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies persisted at high level for at least 6 months. Challenge studies demonstrated that candidate vaccine reduced the viral loads and inflammation in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected golden Syrian hamsters significantly. In addition  the vaccine-induced antibodies showed cross-neutralization activity against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. These data suggest candidate vaccine is efficacious in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated pneumonia  thereby justifying ongoing phase I II clinical studies in China  NCT04982068 and NCT04990544 .

Additionally  several SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously challenged diagnostic testing due to viral diversity in spike and nucleocapsid  N  protein mutations. SARS-CoV-2-variant proliferation potentially affects N protein-targeted rapid antigen testing. We performed rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  tests simultaneously in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . To determine the N protein variations  direct whole-genome sequencing was performed  and the viral assemblies were uploaded to GISAID. We compared their genomes with those of global virus strains from GISAID. These isolates belonged to the B.1.1.7 variant  exhibiting several amino acid substitutions  including D3L  R203K  G204R  and S235F N protein mutations. We also identified the T135I mutation in one variant case in which rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests were discordantly negative and positive  respectively. Our findings suggest that the variants undetected by the PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test may be due to N-protein T135I mutations  posing a potential diagnostic risk to commercially available antigen tests. Hence  we recommend concomitant paired rapid antigen tests and molecular diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. False-negative results could be rapidly corrected using confirmatory RT-PCR results to prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.

This viewpoint advocates for countries to conduct prior efficacy studies before they embark on mass vaccination and addresses the role of nanoparticles as carrier vehicles for these vaccines with a view to explore the present challenges and forge a path for a stronger and more viable future for the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemics. We also look at the emerging prophylactics and therapeutics in the light of ongoing cases of severe and critical COVID-19.

Various rRT‐PCR assays are currently used worldwide  targeting different genes of the SARS‐CoV‐2. Here  we compared the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance  sensitivity and specificity  of Allplex SARS‐CoV‐2 FluA FluB RSV assay  Seegene   Standard M nCoV real‐time detection kit  SD Biosensor   and U‐TOP COVID‐19 detection kit  Seasun Biomaterials  for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection. METHODS: Two hundred and forty‐nine nasopharyngeal swab samples were evaluated to compare the clinical performance of the rRT‐PCR assays. For the analytical performance evaluation  two RNA controls with known viral loads—SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA control and SARS‐COV‐2 B.1.351 RNA control—were used to investigate the potential impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants  particularly the B.1.351 lineage. RESULTS: Limits of detection ranged from 650 to 1300 copies ml for rRT‐PCR assays  and the mean differences in cycle threshold  C  t    values of the two RNA controls were within 1.0 for each target in the rRT‐PCR assays  0.05–0.73   without any prominent C  t  value shift or dropouts in the SARS‐COV‐2 B.1.351 RNA control. Using the consensus criterion as the reference standard  89 samples were positive  whereas 160 were negative. The overall clinical performance of rRT‐PCR assays was comparable  sensitivity 98.88%–100%; specificity 99.38%–100%   whereas the sensitivities of each target gene were more variable. CONCLUSIONS: The three rRT‐PCR assays showed comparable analytical sensitivity and clinical performance. The analytical and clinical sensitivities of each target gene were influenced more by the primer and probe design than the target gene itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a great risk to those with hematological malignancies who are at higher risk of severe disease and death than the general population. Previous studies looking at the immune response to influenza vaccination in those with MDS had shown promising results  with immune responses not differing from those of healthy family members. Whilst some data exist to reassure the MDS community that majority of patients show seroconversion following Covid-19 vaccination  little data exists on their neutralizing capacity or post vaccination T-cell responses in this cohort. In addition  the majority of patients in these studies received BNT162b2 and there is little published data on vaccine response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We have investigated the humoral and T-cell response of 39 patients with MDS two to four weeks following Covid-19 booster vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 through the SOAP study  Sars-cov-2 fOr cAncer Patients  IRAS project ID:282337 . Plasma and PBMCs from MDS cases and healthy controls have been collected  and are being assessed for both humoral and cellular responses to SARS_CoV_2  the alpha  B.1.1.7  and delta  B.1.617.2  variants. Humoral responses will be assessed using ELISA  peptide binding  and functional viral neutralization assays. Cellular responses will be assessed using IFNy ELISPOT and flow cytometry  CD25 and CD69 expression  after 24h peptide stimulation. All data at time point 1  2 - 4 weeks following booster vaccination  have been collected and will subsequently be collected at 6 months and 12 months post-vaccination. We also report on the safety data for these vaccines within this patient population. Of this cohort 64% were male with a median age of 65 years  range 21-84 . 54% received vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 44% received BNT162b2  2% unrecorded . The vaccines were well tolerated with no serious adverse events to date. The mean interval between doses was 70.7 days  range 50 - 90 days . 71% of the cohort were receiving no disease modifying therapy at the time of vaccination  half of whom were receiving supportive therapy and the other half no intervention for their MDS. Of those receiving disease modifying therapy; 5 were receiving azacitidine   1 in conjunction with low-dose cytarabine  and 3 ciclosporin. We will report the largest study of the humoral and T-cell mediated response to the Covid-19 vaccine in MDS patients to date. This will include cellular response to the delta variant and immunogenicity of both the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. Given the vulnerability of these patients to severe disease  investigating the immune response to the vaccines begins to build an evidence base for advising MDS patients on their ongoing risk of infection during the pandemic and going forward. The SOAP study will reassess the immune response at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination to continue to investigate post-vaccine immunity in this cohort. Disclosures Kulasekararaj: F.

Soon after Asia  Europe was seriously affected. Many countries  including Romania  adopted lockdown measures to limit the outbreak. AIM: We performed a molecular epidemiology analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral strains circulating in Romania during the first two months of the epidemic in order to detect mutation profiles and phylogenetic relatedness. METHODS: Respiratory samples were directly used for shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: All Romanian sequences belonged to lineage B  with a different subtype distribution between northern and southern regions  subtype B.1.5 and B.1.1 . Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Romanian epidemic started with multiple introduction events from other European countries followed by local transmission. Phylogenetic links between northern Romania and Spain  Austria  Scotland and Russia were observed  as well as between southern Romania and Switzerland  Italy  France and Turkey. One viral strain presented a previously unreported mutation in the Nsp2 gene  namely K489E. Epidemiologically-defined clusters displayed specific mutations  suggesting molecular signatures for strains coming from areas that were isolated during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Romanian epidemic was initiated by multiple introductions from European countries followed by local transmissions. Different subtype distribution between northern and southern Romania was observed after two months of the pandemic.

From December 2020 to June 2021 this lineage has been detected in 31 countries. Phylogeographic analyses of A.27 sequences obtained from national and international databases reveal a global spread of this lineage through multiple introductions from its inferred origin in Western Africa. Variant A.27 is characterized by a mutational pattern in the spike gene that includes the L18F  L452R and N501Y spike amino acid substitutions found in various variants of concern but lacks the globally dominant D614G. Neutralization assays demonstrate an escape of A.27 from convalescent and vaccine-elicited antibody-mediated immunity. Moreover  the therapeutic monoclonal antibody Bamlanivimab and partially the REGN-COV2 cocktail fail to block infection by A.27. Our data emphasize the need for continued global monitoring of novel lineages because of the independent evolution of new escape mutations.

Increased off-label use of ivermectin for COVID-19 has been reported. We here assessed the effect of ivermectin in Syrian hamsters infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta  B.1.351  variant. Infected animals received a clinically relevant dose of ivermectin  0.4 mg kg subcutaneously dosed  once daily for four consecutive days after which the effect was quantified. Ivermectin monotherapy did not reduce lung viral load and even significantly worsened SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology. Additionally  it did not potentiate the activity of molnupiravir  Lagevrio TM   when combined with this drug. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence that ivermectin does not result in a beneficial effect in the treatment of COVID-19. These findings are important given the increasing  dangerous off-label use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19.

Here  we infect Moderna mRNA-vaccinated or previously infected hamsters with the Omicron BA.1 variant. While the Moderna mRNA vaccine reduces viral loads in the respiratory tissues upon challenge with an early S-614G isolate  the vaccine efficacy is not as pronounced after infection with the Omicron variant. Previous infection with the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate prevents replication after re-challenge with either virus in the lungs of previously infected hamsters  but the Omicron variant replicates efficiently in nasal turbinate tissue. These results experimentally demonstrate in an animal model that the antigenic changes in the Omicron variant are responsible for vaccine breakthrough and re-infection.

The novel viral lineages P.1  Variant of Concern Gamma  and P.2  respectively identified in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro  have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study  we performed the whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions  including Amazonas  North region   Rio Grande do Norte  Paraíba and Bahia  Northeast region   and Rio de Janeiro  Southeast region  in order to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil in the first months of 2021. Here  we showed a widespread dispersal of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions and  except for Amazonas  P.2 was the predominant lineage identified in the sampled states. We estimated the origin of P.2 lineage to have happened in February  2020 and identified that it has differentiated into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March  but reached its peak in December  2020 and January  2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December and its origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of lineage P.7  recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil  to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1  P.2 and P.7 are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain  which co-dominated the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil with the B.1.1.33 strain. We also identified the occurrence of a new lineage descending from B.1.1.33 that convergently carries the E484K mutation  N.9. Indeed  the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether  our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to identify novel variants of interest and monitor for vaccine effectiveness.

We demonstrated the circulation of two novel emergent lineages  VUI-NP13L and VUI-NP13L-like  and five major lineages that had already been assigned  B.1.1.33  B.1.1.28  P.2  B.1.91  B.1.195 . P.2 and VUI-NP13L demonstrated a massive spread in October 2020. Constant and consistent genomic surveillance is crucial to identify newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and to guide decision making in the Brazilian Public Healthcare System.

However  host demographic or clinical characteristics that predict variability in cross-reactive antibody levels are not well-described. These data could inform clinicians  researchers  and policy makers on the populations most likely to require vaccine booster shots. METHODS: In an institutional review board-approved prospective observational cohort study of staff at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital  we identified participants with plasma samples collected after SARS-CoV-2 infection  after mRNA vaccination  and after vaccination following infection  and quantitated IgG levels by ELISA to the spike receptor binding domain  RBD  from five important SARS-CoV-2 variants  Wuhan Hu-1  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.617.2 . We used regression models to identify factors that contributed to cross-reactive IgG against one or multiple viral variants. RESULTS: Following infection  a minority of the cohort generated cross-reactive antibodies  IgG antibodies that bound all tested variants. Those that did had increased disease severity  poor metabolic health  and were of a particular ancestry. Vaccination increased the levels of cross-reactive IgG levels in all populations including immunocompromised  elderly and persons with poor metabolic health. Younger people with a healthy weight mounted the highest responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide important new information on individual antibody responses to infection vaccination that could inform clinicians on the populations that may require follow-on immunization.

RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD  the N-terminal domain  NTD  and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike  we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait  we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus  whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly  mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However  this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study  we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number  R t   of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut  a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021  as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the R t  of B.1.1.7 was 6–10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework  we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally  we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies  clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions. Our framework  which uses open-source methods requiring minimal computational resources  may be used to monitor near real-time variant dynamics in a myriad of settings.

However  multiple variants have emerged with mutations in the spike protein amongst others  the key target of neutralising antibodies. We evaluated the neutralising efficacy of 89 serum samples from patients  infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of 2020  against two virus variants isolated from acutely infected patients and harbouring spike protein mutations. One isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.351  MUC-IMB-B.1.351  whilst the other  MUC-484  was isolated from an immunocompromised patient  sharing some but not all mutations with B.1.351 and representing a transitional variant. Both variants showed a significant reduction in neutralisation sensitivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with MUC-IMB-B.1.351 being almost completely resistant to neutralisation. The observed reduction in neutralising activity of wild-type-specific antibodies against both variants suggests that individual mutations in the spike protein are sufficient to confer a potent escape from the humoral immune response. In addition  the effect of escape mutations seems to accumulate  so that more heavily mutated variants show a greater loss of sensitivity to neutralisation up to complete insensitivity as observed for MUC-IMB-B.1.351. From a clinical point of view  this might affect the efficacy of  monoclonal  antibody treatment of patients with prolonged infections as well as patients infected with variants other than the donor. At the same  this could also negatively influence the efficacy of current vaccines  as they are based on wild-type spike protein  emphasising the need to thoroughly surveil the emergence and distribution of variants and adapt vaccines and therapeutics accordingly.

These vaccines have been quite effective in reducing the possibility of severe illness  hospitalization and death. However  the recent emergence of Variants of Concern specifically the delta variant  B.1.617.2  had resulted in additional waves of the pandemic. METHODS: We aim to review the literature to understand the transmission and disease severity  and determine the efficacy of the current COVID-19 vaccines. We searched Pubmed  Scopus  and Embase till August 4th 2021  and used the search terms “delta variant”  “vaccinations” ” breakthrough infections”  and “neutralizing antibody”. For the meta-analysis  21 studies were screened in particular and five articles  148 071 cases  were included in the study  and only four were analyzed in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: In this review  both in vitro and in vivo studies showed significant reductions in neutralization rates against delta variants for vaccinated individuals and convalescent patients with prior history of COVID-19. However  There was a lower incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to Delta variant was found after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech  Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. CONCLUSION: In fully vaccinated individuals  symptomatic infection with the delta variant was significantly reduced  and therefore  vaccinations play an important role to assist the fight against delta variant.

However  sporadic cases of infection in vaccinated persons have been reported. We describe a case of a double-dose vaccinated woman with COVID-19. All stages of infection were observed  from no identification of virus  then the start of the infection  a high viral load  coming out of viraemia  and finally no detection of the virus. Despite the high viral load  the woman demonstrated mild COVID-19 symptoms  manifested only by a sore throat. The antibody results showed that she produced both post-infectious and post-vaccination immune responses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained viral genome sequence indicated that the virus belonged to the UK SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7  GR 501Y.V1; 20I S:501Y.V1; Alpha variant .

Here  we show that O-glycosylation near the furin cleavage site is mediated by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family and is dependent on the novel proline at position 681  P681 . We further demonstrate that O-glycosylation of S decreases furin cleavage. Finally  we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that O-glycosylation may influence viral infectivity tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic insight into the potential role of P681 mutations in the recently identified  highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant.

Here  we assessed the immunogenicity and protective activity of historical  mRNA-1273  designed for Wuhan-1 spike  or modified  mRNA-1273.351  designed for B.1.351 spike  preclinical Moderna mRNA vaccines in 129S2 and K18-hACE2 mice. Immunization with high or low dose formulations of mRNA vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies in serum against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and several variants  although levels were lower particularly against the B.1.617.2  Delta  virus. Protection against weight loss and lung pathology was observed with all high-dose vaccines against all viruses. Nonetheless  low-dose formulations of the vaccines  which produced lower magnitude antibody and T cell responses  and serve as a possible model for waning immunity  showed breakthrough lung infection and pneumonia with B.1.617.2. Thus  as levels of immunity induced by mRNA vaccines decline  breakthrough infection and disease likely will occur with some SARS-CoV-2 variants  suggesting a need for additional booster regimens.

There is a critical need to understand the impact of the emerging variants on host response and disease dynamics to facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Syrian golden hamsters are the leading small animal model that recapitulates key aspects of severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . In this study  we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into hamsters with the ancestral virus  nCoV-WA1–2020  or VOC first identified in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7  and South Africa  B.1.351  led to similar gross and histopathologic pulmonary lesions. Although differences in viral genomic copy numbers were noted in the lungs and oral swabs of challenged animals  infectious titers in the lungs were comparable. Antibody neutralization capacities varied  dependent on the original challenge virus and cross-variant protective capacity. Transcriptional profiling indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in response to B.1.1.7. Furthermore  no additional mutations in the spike protein were detected at peak disease. In conclusion  the emerging VOC showed distinct humoral responses and transcriptional profiles in the hamster model compared to the ancestral virus.

Novel SARS-CoV-2 variants characterized by spike protein mutations have recently resulted in clinical and epidemiological concerns  as they potentially have increased infectious rates  increased transmission  or reduced neutralization by antibodies produced via vaccination. Many variants have been identified at this time  but the variant of continuing concern has been the Delta variant  B.1.617.2   due to its increased transmissibility and infectious rate. Felines vaccinated using an experimental SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based veterinary vaccine mounted a robust immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using a reporter virus particle system and feline serum  we have verified that vaccinated felines produce antibodies that neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and variant B.1.617.2 at comparable levels.

This study aimed to assess the risk of emergence of mutations following treatment with a single monoclonal antibody. Bamlanivimab was administered at a single dose of 700 mg in a one-hour IV injection in a referral center for the management of COVID-19 in France. Patients were closely monitored clinically and virologically with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and viral whole genome sequencing. Six patients were treated for a nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection  all males  with a median age of 65 years and multiple comorbidities. All patients were infected with a B.1.1.7 variant  which was the most frequent variant in France at the time  and no patients had E484 mutations at baseline. Bamlanivimab was infused in the six patients within 4 days of the COVID-19 diagnosis. Four patients had a favorable outcome  one died of complications unrelated to COVID-19 or bamlanivimab  and one kidney transplant patient treated with belatacept died from severe COVID-19 more than 40 days after bamlanivimab administration. Virologically  four patients cleared nasopharyngeal viral shedding within one month after infusion  while two presented prolonged viral excretion for more than 40 days. The emergence of E484K mutants was observed in five out of six patients  and the last patient presented a Q496R mutation potentially associated with resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results show a high risk of emergence of resistance mutants in COVID-19 patients treated with monoclonal antibody monotherapy.

Variants of concern  alpha  beta  gamma and delta  acquired four patterns of spike glycoprotein mutations that enhance transmissibility and immune evasion: 1  mutations in the N-terminal domain  NTD   2  mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain  RBD   3  mutations at interchain contacts of the spike trimer  and 4  furin cleavage site mutations. Most distinguishing mutations among variants of concern are exhibited in the NTD  localized to sites of high structural flexibility. Emerging variants of interest such as mu  lambda and C.1.2 exhibit the same patterns of mutations as variants of concern. There is a strong likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 variants will continue to emerge with mutations in these defined patterns  thus providing a basis for the development of next line antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates.

Here we demonstrate in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are 100-fold more lethal than the original SARS-CoV-2 bearing 614D. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 cause more severe organ lesions in K18-hACE2 mice than early SARS-CoV-2 strains bearing 614D or 614G  with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection resulting in distinct tissue-specific cytokine signatures  significant D-dimer depositions in vital organs and less pulmonary hypoxia signaling before death. However  K18-hACE2 mice with prior infection of early SARS-CoV-2 strains or intramuscular immunization of viral spike or receptor binding domain are resistant to the lethal reinfection of B.1.1.7 or B.1.351  despite having reduced neutralization titers against these VOC than early strains. Our results thus distinguish pathogenic patterns in K18-hACE2 mice caused by B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection from those induced by early SARS-CoV-2 strains  and help inform potential medical interventions for combating COVID-19.

How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening 1 2  to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups  A–F —a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications 3–5 . Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically  neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D  the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif  are largely escaped by K417N  G446S  E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E  for example  S309  6  and group F  for example  CR3022  7   which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity  are less affected by Omicron  but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D  N440K and S371L. Furthermore  Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped  owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total  over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs  the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016  LY-CoV555  REGN10933  REGN10987  AZD1061  AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron  whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together  our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion  and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective. Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.

While performing epidemiological and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from Porto Ferreira—São Paulo—Brazil  we identified sequences classified by pangolin as B.1.1.28 harboring Spike L452R mutation  in the RBD region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences grouped into a monophyletic branch  with others from Brazil  mainly from the state of São Paulo. The sequences had a set of 15 clade defining amino acid mutations  of which six were in the Spike protein. A new lineage was proposed to Pango and it was accepted and designated P.4. In samples from the city of Porto Ferreira  P.4 lineage has been increasing in frequency since it was first detected in March 2021  corresponding to 34.7% of the samples sequenced in June  the second in prevalence after P.1. Also  it is circulating in 30 cities from the state of São Paulo  and it was also detected in one sample from the state of Sergipe and two from the state of Rio de Janeiro. Further studies are needed to understand whether P.4 should be considered a new threat.

More than 300 million cases and over 5 million deaths later  we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly  reaching most countries within the first half of 2020  and New Zealand was not an exception. Here  we describe the first isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to inoculate Vero cells and  three to four days later  a cytopathic effect was observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using Vero and VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by RT-qPCR  Western blot  indirect immunofluorescence assays  and electron microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet complementary deep sequencing platforms  MiSeq Illumina and Ion PGM™ Ion Torrent™   classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55  B.31  B.1  or B.1.369 based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were susceptible to remdesivir  EC 50  values from 0.83 to 2.42 µM  and β-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine  molnupiravir  EC 50  values from 0.96 to 1.15 µM  but not to favipiravir  >10 µM . Interestingly  four SARS-CoV-2 isolates  carrying the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility  were more susceptible  2.4-fold  to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether  this seminal work allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand  paving the way for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country  including the development and validation of diagnostic assays  antiviral strategies  and a national COVID-19 vaccine development program.

The wild strain  the Alpha variant  B.1.1.7  and the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  were the principal culprits behind these waves. To mitigate the pandemic  the vaccination campaign was started in January 2021. While the vaccine efficacy is less than 1  breakthrough infections were reported. This work aims to examine the effects of the vaccination across 50 US states and the District of Columbia.  2  Methods: Based on the classic Susceptible—Exposed—Infectious–Recovered  SEIR  model  we add a delay class between infectious and death  a death class and a vaccinated class. We compare two special cases of our new model to simulate the effects of the vaccination. The first case expounds the vaccinated individuals with full protection or not  compared to the second case where all vaccinated individuals have the same level of protection.  3  Results: Through fitting the two approaches to reported COVID-19 deaths in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia  we found that these two approaches are equivalent. We calculate that the death toll could be 1.67–3.33 fold in most states if the vaccine was not available. The median and mean infection fatality ratio are estimated to be approximately 0.6 and 0.7%.  4  Conclusions: The two approaches we compared were equivalent in evaluating the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign in the US. In addition  the effect of the vaccination campaign was significant  with a large number of deaths averted.

Humoral immunity wanes over time and variants of concern with immune escape are posing an increasing threat. Little is known about protection against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant of concern in hemodialysis patients before and after third vaccination. We determined anti-S1 IgG  surrogate neutralizing  and IgG antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in 84 hemodialysis patients directly before and three weeks after a third vaccine dose with BNT162b2. Third vaccination was performed after a median  IQR  of 119  109–165  days after second vaccination. In addition  neutralizing activity against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant was assessed in 31 seroconverted hemodialysis patients before and after third vaccination. Triple seropositivity for anti-S1 IgG  surrogate neutralizing  and anti-RBD antibodies increased from 31 84  37%  dialysis patients after second to 80 84  95%  after third vaccination. Neutralizing activity against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant was significantly higher after third vaccination with a median  IQR  ID 50  of 1:320  1:160–1:1280  compared with 1:20  0–1:40  before a third vaccine dose  P<0.001 . The anti-S1 IgG index showed the strongest correlation with the ID 50  against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant determined by live virus neutralization  r=0.91 . We demonstrate low neutralizing activity against the B.1.617.2  delta  variant in dialysis patients four months after standard two-dose vaccination but a substantial increase after a third vaccine dose. Booster vaccination s  should be considered earlier than 6 months after the second vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals.

Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population  including vaccinated individuals. Here  we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley  including the city of Philadelphia  and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020  all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed  notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7  alpha   with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2  delta  and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs  we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2  delta  showed 3-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases  odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11 . Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs  notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha  beta and gamma variants  odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of1.25–3.18 . This study thus overviews viral evolution and vaccine breakthroughs in the Delaware Valley and introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating enrichment of breakthrough variants against a changing background.

Yet there are no generally accepted methods to consistently estimate the relative magnitude of the change in transmissiblity of newly emerging variants. In this paper we consider three methods for examining and quantifying positive selection of new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 over an existing wild-type strain. We consider replication at the level of countries and allow for the action of other processes that can change variants’ frequencies  specifically migration and drift. We apply these methods to the D614G spike mutation and the variant designated B.1.1.7  in every country where there is sufficient sequence data. For each of D614G and B.1.1.7  we find evidence for strong selection  greater than 25% increased contagiousness  in more than half of countries analyzed. Our results also shows that the selective advantages of these strains are highly heterogeneous at the country level  suggesting the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

A way to handle such spreads is through a containment strategy  where the population in the affected area is isolated until the spread has been stopped. Under such circumstances  it is important to monitor whether the mutated virus is extinct via massive testing for the virus sub-type. If successful  the strategy will lead to lower and lower numbers of the sub-type  and it will eventually die out. An important question is  for how long time one should wait to be sure the sub-type is extinct? We use a hidden Markov model for infection spread and an approximation of a two stage sampling scheme to infer the probability of extinction. The potential of the method is illustrated via a simulation study. Finally  the model is used to assess the Danish containment strategy when SARS-CoV-2 spread from mink to man during the summer of 2020  including the Cluster-5 sub-type. In order to avoid further spread and mink being a large animal virus reservoir  this situation led to the isolation of seven municipalities in the Northern part of the country  the culling of the entire Danish 17 million large mink population  and a bill to interim ban Danish mink production until the end of 2021.

Hence  together with increased genomic surveillance  methods to rapidly develop and assess effective interventions are critically needed. Here we report the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients using a high-throughput platform. Antibodies were identified from unpaired donor B-cell and serum repertoires using yeast surface display  proteomics  and public light chain screening. Cryo-EM and functional characterization of the antibodies identified N3–1  an antibody that binds avidly  K d app  = 68 pM  to the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein and robustly neutralizes the virus in vitro. This antibody likely binds all three RBDs of the trimeric spike protein with a single IgG. Importantly  N3–1 equivalently binds spike proteins from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  neutralizes UK variant B.1.1.7  and binds SARS-CoV spike with nanomolar affinity. Taken together  the strategies described herein will prove broadly applicable in interrogating adaptive immunity and developing rapid response biological countermeasures to emerging pathogens.

Omicron has three lineages or subvariants  BA.1  B.1.1.529.1   BA.2  B.1.1.529.2   and BA.3  B.1.1.529.3 . Among them  BA.1 is the currently prevailing subvariant. BA.2 shares 32 mutations with BA.1 but has 28 distinct ones. BA.3 shares most of its mutations with BA.1 and BA.2 except for one. BA.2 is found to be able to alarmingly reinfect patients originally infected by Omicron BA.1. An important question is whether BA.2 or BA.3 will become a new dominating ``variant of concern''. Currently  no experimental data has been reported about BA.2 and BA.3. We construct a novel algebraic topology-based deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of mutational and deep mutational data to systematically evaluate BA.2's and BA.3's infectivity  vaccine breakthrough capability  and antibody resistance. Our comparative analysis of all main variants namely  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta  Lambda  Mu  BA.1  BA.2  and BA.3  unveils that BA.2 is about 1.5 and 4.2 times as contagious as BA.1 and Delta  respectively. It is also 30% and 17-fold more capable than BA.1 and Delta  respectively  to escape current vaccines. Therefore  we project that Omicron BA.2 is on its path to becoming the next dominating variant. We forecast that like Omicron BA.1  BA.2 will also seriously compromise most existing mAbs  except for sotrovimab developed by GlaxoSmithKline.

We report an unrecognized introduction of the variant B.1.1.7 in Gabon in December 2020  which was the initial phase of the variant introduction to Africa. The B.1.1.7 variant was also detected in a hospitalized patient in January 2021  indicating a rapid spread of the variant in Gabon since its first detection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the detected B.1.1.7 variants originated from the distinct regions  strongly suggesting that the B.1.1.7 variant had been repeatedly introduced to Gabon since December 2020. These results provide insights on the unrecognized risks of infections with variants of concern  and show the necessity to conduct continuous genomic monitoring for immediate alert and control of novel SARS‐CoV‐2 variant infections.

Variants first detected in the United Kingdom  South Africa  and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool  Variant Database  VDB   for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB  we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage  now designated as B.1.526  are L5F  T95I  D253G  E484K or S477N  D614G  and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City  NYC . By February 2021  genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC  notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K  which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma  indicating the public health importance of this lineage.

We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK  using age-structured  weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a  step-like or graded  change in infection fatality rate  IFR  have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover  they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However  the same models consistently infer that  most probably  the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which variant B.1.1.7  alpha  became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore  according to our models  the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France  which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period  despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant s  may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020  other factors  such as seasonality  or pressure on health services  are likely to also have contributed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied ninety SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between March and October 2020. Whole genome sequences from our laboratory and available genomes were used to investigate phylogeny  genetic variantion and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Pakistan. Site specific entropy analysis compared mutation rates between strains isolated before and after June 2020. RESULTS: In March  strains belonging to L  S  V and GH clades were observed but by October  only L and GH strains were present. The highest diversity of clades was present in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory and the least in Punjab province. Initial introductions of SARS-CoV-2 GH  B.1.255  B.1  and S  A  clades were associated with overseas travelers. Additionally  GH  B.1.255  B.1  B.1.160  B.1.36   L  B  B.6  B.4   V  B.4  and S  A  clades were transmitted locally. SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered with global strains except for ten which matched Pakistani isolates. RNA substitution rates were estimated at 5.86 x10 −4 . The most frequent mutations were 5’ UTR 241C > T  Spike glycoprotein D614G  RNA dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp  P4715L and Orf3a Q57H. Strains up until June 2020 exhibited an overall higher mean and site-specific entropy as compared with sequences after June. Relative entropy was higher across GH as compared with GR and L clades. More sites were under selection pressure in GH strains but this was not significant for any particular site. CONCLUSIONS: The higher entropy and diversity observed in early pandemic as compared with later strains suggests increasing stability of the genomes in subsequent COVID-19 waves. This would likely lead to the selection of site-specific changes that are advantageous to the virus  as has been currently observed through the pandemic.

Its tremendous incidence favoured the emergence of viral variants. The current genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 has a clear impact on epidemiology and clinical practice  especially regarding transmission rates and the effectiveness of vaccines. In this study  we evaluated the replication of different SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing different virus genotypes which have been isolated throughout the pandemic. We used three distinct cell lines  including Vero E6 cells originating from monkeys; Caco-2 cells  an intestinal epithelium cell line originating from humans; and Calu-3 cells  a pulmonary epithelium cell line also originating from humans. We used RT-qPCR to replicate different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes by quantifying the virus released in the culture supernatant of infected cells. We found that the different viral isolates replicate similarly in Caco-2 cells  but show very different replicative capacities in Calu-3 cells. This was especially highlighted for the lineages B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1  which are considered to be variants of concern. These results underscore the importance of the evaluation and characterisation of each SARS-CoV-2 isolate in order to establish the replication patterns before performing tests  and of the consideration of the ideal SARS-CoV-2 genotype–cell type pair for each assay.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants  including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and P.3  contain mutations in spike that has been suggested to associate with an increased recognition of mouse ACE2  raising the postulation that these SARS-CoV-2 variants may have evolved to expand species tropism to wildtype mouse and potentially other murines. Our study evaluated this possibility with substantial public health importance. METHODS: We investigated the capacity of wildtype  WT  SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants in infecting mice  Mus musculus  and rats  Rattus norvegicus  under in vitro and in vivo settings. Susceptibility to infection was evaluated with RT-qPCR  plaque assays  immunohistological stainings  and neutralization assays. FINDINGS: Our results reveal that B.1.1.7 and other N501Y-carrying variants but not WT SARS-CoV-2 can infect wildtype mice. High viral genome copies and high infectious virus particle titres are recovered from the nasal turbinate and lung of B.1.1.7-inocluated mice for 4-to-7 days post infection. In agreement with these observations  robust expression of viral nucleocapsid protein and histopathological changes are detected from the nasal turbinate and lung of B.1.1.7-inocluated mice but not that of the WT SARS-CoV-2-inoculated mice. Similarly  B.1.1.7 readily infects wildtype rats with production of infectious virus particles. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 variant  B.1.1.7  as well as other N501Y-carrying variants including B.1.351 and P.3  has gained the capability to expand species tropism to murines and public health measures including stringent murine control should be implemented to facilitate the control of the ongoing pandemic.

Cellular immune responses  particularly CD8+ T cell responses  are likely critical for protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease 2–6 . Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is highly cross-reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses that showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and Omicron variants  including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron-specific CD8+ T cell responses were 82–84% of WA1 2020-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data suggest that current vaccines may provide considerable protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantial reduction of neutralizing antibody responses.

Implementation of Use of Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in a Large Academic Center for the Outpatient Treatment of Covid-19: Impact on 30 Day Hospitalization Rates  ED Visits and Death,BACKGROUND: Monoclonal Antibody Therapy  MAbs  has been shown to reduce rates of ED visits and hospitalizations in patients at risk for severe Covid-19 infection in clinical trials. Since November  three Mabs received emergency use authorization: Bamlanivimab  Bam   Bamlanivimab Etesevimab  Bam Ete  and Casirivimab Imdevimab  Casi imdevi . We describe here the real-world effectiveness of implementing early MAb therapy in the outpatient setting for individuals with Covid-19 at high risk of progression. METHODS: We examined the records of 808 UCLA Health patients with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV2 PCR test who were either referred for outpatient Mab therapy or received Mab treatment in the emergency department  ED  between December 10  2020  and May 3  2021. The primary outcome of our analysis was the combined 30-day incidence of emergency department visits  hospitalizations  or death following the date of referral. SARS-CoV2 isolates of hospitalized patients who had received Mabs were sequenced to determine the presence of variants. RESULTS: Of 808 patients  383 were referred for treatment but did not receive treatment  109 received Mabs in the ED and 316 patients were treated in an outpatient setting. Composite 30-day mortality  ED visits and hospital admissions were significantly reduced in the combination therapy group  Bam Ete or Cas Imd  compared with monotherapy  Bam alone  or no treatment groups  aHR 0.16  95% CI .038  .67 . Significant factors associated with the composite outcome included: history of lung disease  HR 4.46  95% CI 2.89-6.90   cardiovascular disease  HR 1.87  95% CI 1.12-3.12   kidney disease  HR 2.04  95% CI 1.27-3.25   and immunocompromised state  HR 3.24  95% CI 1.02-10.26  as well as high social vulnerability index  HR 1.87  95% CI 1.13-3.10 . Over one-third of hospitalized patients who had received Mabs were confirmed to have the California variant  B.1.427 29   Figure 1 . [Image: see text] Figure 1. Covid-19 MAB Treatment Failure Lineages CONCLUSION: Our data show that in a real-world setting  combination monoclonal antibody therapy  not monotherapy  significantly reduced ED visits and hospital admissions  likely due to the presence of the California variants. High socioeconomic vulnerability and certain medical conditions increased risk of treatment failure. DISCLOSURES: Omai Garner  PhD  D ABMM   Beckman Coulter  Scientific Research Study Investigator 
doi:10.3390/vaccines9050517,Neutralizing Antibody Response of Vaccinees to SARS-CoV-2 Variants,doi:10.3390/vaccines9050517,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069852/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050517,pubmed:34069852,pmc:PMC8157345,Vaccines (Basel),2021,Neutralizing Antibody Response of Vaccinees to SARS-CoV-2 Variants,Due to their increased transmissibility  three variants of high concern have emerged in the United Kingdom  also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012 01   South Africa  B.1.351 lineage   and Brazil  P1 lineage  with multiple substitutions in the spike protein. Since neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination are likely considered as correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2 infection  it is important to analyze whether vaccinees with mRNA BNT162b2 are equally protected against these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. To this aim  we enrolled healthy subjects one month after complete vaccination with Comirnaty and evaluated the neutralizing response against the native Wuhan strain and the emerging B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P1 lineages  by using the microneutralization assay  currently considered the gold standard test for the evaluation and detection of functional neutralizing antibodies. The most remarkable finding of this study was the significantly lower neutralizing antibody titer against B.1.351 lineage  compared to the wild-type virus. No significant differences were observed with the other two lineages. These findings provide evidence that vaccinated subjects may not be equally protected against all SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Most likely  the new variant emerged in a persistently infected patient  justifying a special focus on these cases. Our aim in this study was to explore certain clinical profiles involving severe immunosuppression that may help explain the prolonged persistence of viable viruses. We present three severely immunosuppressed cases  A  B  and C  with a history of lymphoma and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding  2  4  and 6 months   two of whom finally died. Whole-genome sequencing of 9 and 10 specimens from Cases A and B revealed extensive within-patient acquisition of diversity  12 and 28 new single nucleotide polymorphisms  respectively  which suggests ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication. This diversity was not observed for Case C after analysing 5 sequential nasopharyngeal specimens and one plasma specimen  and was only observed in one bronchoaspirate specimen  although viral viability was still considered based on constant low Ct values throughout the disease and recovery of the virus in cell cultures. The acquired viral diversity in Cases A and B followed different dynamics. For Case A  new single nucleotide polymorphisms were quickly fixed  13–15 days  after emerging as minority variants  while for Case B  higher diversity was observed at a slower emergence: fixation pace  1–2 months . Slower SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pace was observed for Case A following the administration of hyperimmune plasma. This work adds knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 prolonged shedding in severely immunocompromised patients and demonstrates viral viability  noteworthy acquired intra-patient diversity  and different SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics in persistent cases.

We present a case of a 37‐year‐old woman admitted to our tertiary hospital at a gestational age of 29 weeks and 1 day because of oligohydramnios with reduced fetal movements for 10 days. About 20 days before admission  she tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 Alpha variant. The following day  due to abnormal cardiotocography  increased brain sparing  and absent end‐diastolic flow in the umbilical artery  an urgent cesarean section was performed. The neonate had an uneventful admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All neonatal samples proved negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. Pathological examination of the placenta revealed intervillous fibrin deposition  ischemic necrosis of villi and histiocytic intervillositis  corresponding with the SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis triad. The placental tissue demonstrated a high viral load  possibly explaining the acute onset of placental insufficiently and subsequent fetal distress. This case demonstrates the importance of seeking medical care when experiencing reduced fetal movement in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients since acute infection can induce significant placental and subsequent fetal pathology.

We performed a cell culture-based neutralization assay focusing on authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1  Kappa   B.1.617.2  Delta   B.1.427 B.1.429  Epsilon   all harboring the spike substitution L452R. We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1  Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 8.00 and 5.33  respectively  which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa  Delta  and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera  whereas convalescent sera were 1.51-fold less effective against Delta  respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa  +E484Q  and Delta  +T478K  were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion  in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant  the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab  which  however  might be circumvented by combination therapy with casirivimab together.

However  lineages B.1.351 and P.1 represent potentially greater risk for transmission and immune escape. In British Columbia  Canada  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 were first identified in December 2020 and P.1 in February 2021. We combined quantitative PCR and whole-genome sequencing to assess relative contribution of VOCs in nearly 67 000 infections during the first 16 weeks of 2021 in British Columbia. B.1.1.7 accounted for <10% of screened or sequenced specimens early on  increasing to >50% by week 8. P.1 accounted for <10% until week 10  increased rapidly to peak at week 12  and by week 13 codominated within 10% of rates of B.1.1.7. B.1.351 was a minority throughout. This rapid expansion of P.1 but suppression of B.1.351 expands our understanding of population-level VOC patterns and might provide clues to fitness determinants for emerging VOCs.

Although much effort has focused on Spike adaptation for viral entry and adaptive immune escape  B.1.1.7 mutations outside Spike likely contribute to enhance transmission. Here we used unbiased abundance proteomics  phosphoproteomics  mRNA sequencing and viral replication assays to show that B.1.1.7 isolates more effectively suppress host innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells. We found that B.1.1.7 isolates have dramatically increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of Orf9b and Orf6  both known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70  a mitochondrial protein required for RNA sensing adaptor MAVS activation  and Orf9b binding and activity was regulated via phosphorylation. We conclude that B.1.1.7 has evolved beyond the Spike coding region to more effectively antagonise host innate immune responses through upregulation of specific subgenomic RNA synthesis and increased protein expression of key innate immune antagonists. We propose that more effective innate immune antagonism increases the likelihood of successful B.1.1.7 transmission  and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection.

We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccine  SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP  protects mice from SARS-CoV-2-induced disease after a single shot  indicating that the vaccine could allow dose-sparing. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP elicits high antibody titers in two non-human primate  NHP  models against multiple distinct RBD antigenic sites known to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies. We benchmarked NHP serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NP against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen using a panel of single-residue spike mutants detected in clinical isolates as well as the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are resilient to most RBD mutations tested  but the E484K substitution has similar negative consequences for neutralization  and exhibit modest but comparable neutralization breadth against distantly related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that mosaic and cocktail sarbecovirus RBD-NPs elicit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity  including against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant  and protect mice against severe SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of the SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and enables advancement of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic.

A 59-year-old unvaccinated patient was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism  with first negative results obtained by both molecular and antigen tests. After several days of viral negativity  he presented positive results for E and RdRP S genes  but negative in N gene. Negativity in N gene was repeatedly confirmed in the following days. Suspecting an infection by the Omicron variant  SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was rapidly performed from nasopharyngeal swab by MiSeq and revealed the presence of the Delta sublineage AY.4 variant with an atypical deletion of six nucleotides  leading to G214-G215 deletion in the Nucleocapsid  thus responsible for NGTF. The analysis of GISAID sequences  N = 2 618 373 12 January 2022  showed that G214-G215 deletion is rarely occurring in most circulating Delta lineages and sublineages in the globe and Europe  with an overall prevalence never exceeding 0.2%. Hence  this study highlights the importance to perform SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and to characterize novel mutations deletions that could jeopardize the proper interpretation of molecular diagnostic tests. Based on these assumptions  the role of deletions in the recently identified Omicron variant deserves further investigation.

Since recently it has been found that SARS-coronavirus are dependent on the host transcriptional factors  TF  to express the viral genes  efforts are required to understand the molecular interplay between virus and host response. By bioinformatic analysis  we investigated human TF that can bind the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and can be involved in viral transcription. In particular  we analyzed the key role of the TF involved in interferon response. We found that several TF could be induced by the interferon antiviral response  specifically some induced by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3  ISGF3  and by un-phosphorylated ISGF3  that were found to promote the transcription of several viral open reading frame. Moreover  we found 22 TF binding sites that are present only in the sequence of virus infecting humans and not in Bat coronavirus RaTG13. The 22 TF are involved in the IFN  the retinoic acid signaling and the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II  thus facilitating its own replication cycle. This mechanism  by competition  may steal the human TF involved in these processes  explaining SARS-CoV-2 disruption of the IFN-I signalling in host cells and the mechanism of the SARS retinoic acid depletion syndrome leading to the cytokine storm. We identified also three TF binding sites present exclusively in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant that may explain the higher severity of the respiratory syndrome in this virus variant. These data shed light on SARS-CoV2 dependence from the host transcription machinery associated to interferon response and strengthen our knowledge about the transcription and replicative activity of the virus and could pave the way for new targets drug design and therapeutic approaches.

We investigated an outbreak due to Omicron variant in a restaurant. Besides the epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis  the secondary attack rates of customers of restaurant-related COVID-19 before  outbreak R1  and after enhancement of indoor air dilution  outbreak R2  were compared. On 27 th December 2021  an index case attended restaurant R2 for 98 minutes. Except for 1 sitting in the same table  six other secondary cases sat in 3 corners at 3 different zones  where designated staff served customers at different zones. The median exposure time was 34 minutes  range:19-98 minutes . All 7 secondary cases were phylogenetically related to the index. Smoke test demonstrated the airflow direction airflow which explained the distribution of secondary cases. Compared with an earlier COVID-19 outbreak in another restaurant R1  19 th February 2021   just preceding the mandatory requirement of enhancement of indoor air dilution  the secondary attack rates among customers in R2 was significantly lower than that in R1  3.4% 7 207vs 28.9% 22 76 p<0.001 . Enhancement of indoor air dilution including ventilation and installation of air purifier and upper-room ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation could minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the restaurant.

Molnupiravir Maintains Antiviral Activity Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants In Vitro and in Early Clinical Studies,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.742,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.742,,pmc:PMC8644651,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,543. Molnupiravir Maintains Antiviral Activity Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants In Vitro and in Early Clinical Studies,BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir  MOV  MK-4482  EIDD-2801  is an orally administered prodrug of N-hydroxycytidine  NHC  EIDD-1931   a nucleoside with broad antiviral activity against a range of RNA viruses. MOV acts by driving viral error catastrophe following its incorporation by the viral RdRp into the viral genome. Given its mechanism of action  MOV activity should not be affected by substitutions in the spike protein present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern which impact efficacy of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies and vaccine induced immunity. We characterized MOV activity against variants by assessing antiviral activity in vitro and virologic response from the Phase 2 3 clinical trials  MOVe-In  MOVe-Out  for treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: MOV activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants  was evaluated in an in vitro infection assay. Antiviral potency of NHC  IC50  was determined in Vero E6 cells infected with virus at MOI ~0.1 by monitoring CPE. Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load measures in participants enrolled in MOVe-In and MOVe-Out were analyzed based on SARS-CoV-2 genotype. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from study participants were amplified from nasal swabs by PCR and NGS was performed on samples with viral genome RNA of >22 000 copies ml amplified by primers covering full length genome with Ion Torrent sequencing to identify clades represented in trial participants. SARS-CoV-2 clades were assigned using clade.nextstrain.org. RESULTS: In vitro  NHC was equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  20I   B.1351  20H   and P1  20J   compared with the original WA1  19B  isolate. In clinical trials  no discernable difference was observed in magnitude of viral response measured by change from baseline in RNA titer over time across all clades represented including 20A through 20E and 20G to 20I. No participants at the time of the study presented with 20F  20J  or 21A. CONCLUSION: Distribution of clades in participants in MOVe-In and MOVe-Out was representative of those circulating globally at the time of collection  Oct 2020 – Jan 2021 . Both in vitro and clinical data suggest that spike protein substitutions do not impact antiviral activity of MOV and suggest its potential use for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In Brazil  the disease has cost more than 600 000 lives and affected more than 21 million people. When the second wave of COVID-19 hit in early 2021  the country saw more than 3 500 daily deaths. As Brazil started to recover from this number  the first reports of infection by the Delta  B.1.617.2  Variant of Concern  VoC  in the country were emerging. The first confirmed case of this variant occurred on 26 April 2021  with five states registering infections by it in the following three months. At the time  these cases were considered isolated or contained imported events. Here we describe the early phase of the first large-scale community transmission of the Delta variant in Brazil and the associated interstate dispersal.

Little is known regarding the detailed clinical features of B.1.1.7 variant infection. Data on 74 COVID-19 cases from two outbreaks in two districts of Beijing  China were extracted from a cloud database  including 41 cases from Shunyi District  Shunyi B.1.470 group  and 33 from Daxing  Daxing B.1.1.7 group  from December 25  2020 to January 17  2021. We conducted a comparison of the clinical characteristics. Seven clinical indicators of the Daxing B.1.1.7 group were significantly higher than those of the Shunyi group  including the proportion with fever over 38°C  the levels of C-reactive protein  CRP   serum amyloid A  SAA   creatine kinase  CK   d-dimer  DD   and CD4 +  T lymphocytes  CD4 +  T   and the proportion with ground-glass opacity  GGO  in the lung  P values of ≤0.05 . After adjusting for age  B.1.1.7 variant infection was a risk factor for elevated CRP  P = 0·045   SAA  P = 0·011   CK  P = 0·034   and CD4 +  T  P = 0.029  and for the presence of GGO  P = 0.005 . The median threshold cycle  C T   value of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  tests of the N gene target in the Daxing B.1.1.7 group was significantly lower  P = 0.036  than that in the Shunyi B.1.470 group. Clinical features  including a more serious inflammatory response  pneumonia  and a possibly higher viral load  were detected in the cases infected with B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant  which was first identified in the United Kingdom  has increased sharply in numbers worldwide and was reported to be more contagious than the nonvariant. To our knowledge  no studies investigating the detailed clinical features of COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant have been published. Local epidemics have rarely occurred in China  but occasionally  a small clustered outbreak triggered by an imported SARS-CoV-2 strain with only one chain of transmission could happen. From late 2020 to early 2021  two clustered COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in Beijing  one of which was caused by the B.1.1.7 variant. The COVID-19 patients from the two outbreaks received similar clinical tests  diagnoses  and treatments. We found that the B.1.1.7 variant infection could lead to a more serious inflammatory response  acute response process  more severe pneumonia  and probably higher viral loads. This therefore implies that the B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity.

We investigated the effects of receiving mAbs  bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together  after SARS-CoV-2 infection on the endogenous immune response. METHODS: Longitudinal serum samples were collected from patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 in the BLAZE-1 trial who received placebo  n=153   bamlanivimab alone [700 mg  n=100   2800 mg  n=106   or 7000 mg  n=98 ]  or bamlanivimab  2800 mg  and etesevimab  2800 mg  together  n=111 . A multiplex Luminex serology assay measured antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 antigens  including SARS-CoV-2 protein variants that evade bamlanivimab or etesevimab binding  and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed. RESULTS: The antibody response in patients who received placebo or mAbs had a broad specificity. Titer change from baseline against a receptor-binding domain mutant  Spike-RBD E484Q   as well as N-terminal domain  Spike-NTD  and nucleocapsid protein  NCP  epitopes were 1.4 to 4.1 fold lower at day 15-85 in mAb recipients compared with placebo. Neutralizing activity of day 29 sera from bamlanivimab monotherapy cohorts against both spike E484Q and beta variant  B.1.351  were slightly reduced compared with placebo  by a factor of 3.1  p=0.001  and 2.9  p=0.002  respectively . Early viral load correlated with the subsequent antibody titers of the native  unmodified humoral response  p<0.0001 at Day 15  29  60 and 85 for full-length spike . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 treated with mAbs develop a wide breadth of antigenic responses to SARS-CoV-2. Small reductions in titers and neutralizing activity  potentially due to a decrease in viral load following mAb treatment  suggest minimal impact of mAb treatment on the endogenous immune response.

Our analysis revealed that though the number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges remained the same  the binding affinity of B.1.620 for ACE2 was higher than that of the wild type  consequently increasing infectivity. Moreover  the stable dynamics and other features further justify the findings  corroborating the previous literature. ABSTRACT: Recently  a new variant  B.1620  with mutations  S477N-E484K  in the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain  RBD  has been reported in Europe. In order to design therapeutic strategies suitable for B.1.620  further studies are required. A detailed investigation of the structural features and variations caused by these substitutions  that is  a molecular level investigation  is essential to uncover the role of these changes. To determine whether and how the binding affinity of ACE2–RBD is affected  we used protein–protein docking and all-atom simulation approaches. Our analysis revealed that B.1.620 binds more strongly than the wild type and alters the hydrogen bonding network. The docking score for the wild type was reported to be −122.6 + − 0.7 kcal mol  while for B.1.620  the docking score was −124.9 + − 3.8 kcal mol. A comparative binding investigation showed that the wild-type complex has 11 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge  while the B.1.620 complex has 14 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge  among which most of the interactions are preserved between the wild type and B.1.620. A dynamic analysis of the two complexes revealed stable dynamics  which corroborated the global stability trend  compactness  and flexibility of the three essential loops  providing a better conformational optimization opportunity and binding. Furthermore  binding free energy revealed that the wild type had a total binding energy of −51.14 kcal mol  while for B.1.628  the total binding energy was −68.25 kcal mol. The current findings based on protein complex modeling and bio-simulation methods revealed the atomic features of the B.1.620 variant harboring S477N and E484K mutations in the RBD and the basis for infectivity. In conclusion  the current study presents distinguishing features of B.1.620  which can be used to design structure-based drugs against the B.1.620 variant.

As of May 25th  2021 there were 2.059.941 SARS-COV2 genome sequences that have been submitted to the GISAID database  with numerous variations. Here  we aim to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genome data submitted to the GISAID database from Turkey and to determine the variant and clade distributions by the end of May 2021  in accordance with their appearance timeline. We compared these findings to USA  Europe  and Asia data as well. We have also evaluated the effects of spike protein variations  detected in a group of genome sequences of 13 patients who applied to our clinic  by using 3D modeling algorithms. For this purpose  we analyzed 4607 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted by different lab centers from Turkey to the GISAID database between March 2020 and May 2021. Described mutations were also introduced in silico to the spike protein structure to analyze their isolated impacts on the protein structure. The most abundant clade was GR followed by G  GH  and GRY and we did not detect any V clade. The most common variant was B.1  followed by B.1.1  and the UK variant  B.1.1.7. Our results clearly show a concordance between the variant distributions  the number of cases  and the timelines of different variant accumulations in Turkey. The 3D simulations indicate an increase in the surface hydrophilicity of the reference spike protein and the detected mutations. There was less surface hydrophilicity increase in the Asp614Gly mutation  which exhibits a more compact conformation around the ACE-2 receptor binding domain region  rendering the structure in a “down” conformation. Our genomic findings can help to model vaccination programs and protein modeling may lead to different approaches for COVID-19 treatment strategies.

We assess single-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness  VE  in adults ≥ 70 years old in British Columbia  Canada  where second doses were deferred by up to 16 weeks and where a spring 2021 wave uniquely included codominant circulation of Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Gamma  P.1  variants of concern  VOC . METHODS: Analyses included community-dwelling adults ≥ 70 years old with specimen collection between 4 April  epidemiological week 14  and 1 May  week 17  2021. Adjusted VE was estimated by test-negative design. Cases were reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  test-positive for SARS-CoV-2  and controls were test-negative. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of a single-dose ≥ 21 days before specimen collection  but a range of intervals was assessed. Variant-specific VE was estimated against viruses genetically characterized as Alpha  Gamma or non-VOC lineages. RESULTS: VE analyses included 16 993 specimens: 1226  7%  test-positive cases and 15 767 test-negative controls. Of 1131  92%  genetically characterized viruses  509  45%   314  28%   and 276  24%  were Alpha  Gamma  and non-VOC lineages  respectively. At 0–13 days postvaccination  VE was negligible at 14%  95% confidence interval [CI]  0–26  but increased from 43%  95% CI  30–53  at 14–20 days to 75%  95% CI  63–83  at 35–41 days postvaccination. VE at ≥ 21 days postvaccination was 65%  95% CI  58–71  overall: 72%  95% CI  58–81   67%  95% CI  57–75   and 61%  95% CI  45–72  for non-VOC  Alpha  and Gamma variants  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by about two-thirds in adults ≥ 70 years old  with protection only minimally reduced against Alpha and Gamma variants.

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants  we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417  E484  and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain  RBD . Despite this  we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern  VOCs   including B.1.1.7  alpha   P.1  gamma   and B.1.617.2  delta . Notably  antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants  suggesting that different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.

To develop a highly sensitive test  DSA1N5 was immobilized onto gold electrodes to produce an electrochemical impedance sensor  which was capable of detecting 1000 viral particles per mL in 1:1 diluted saliva in under 10 min without any further sample processing. Evaluation of 36 positive and 37 negative patient saliva samples produced a clinical sensitivity of 80.5 % and specificity of 100 % and the sensor could detect the wildtype virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants in the patient samples  which is the first reported rapid test that can detect any emerging variant of SARS‐CoV‐2.

Although multiple vaccines are available  breakthrough infections occur especially by emerging variants. Effective therapeutic options such as monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  are still critical. Here  we report the development  cryo-EM structures  and functional analyses of mAbs that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. By high-throughput single cell sequencing of B cells from spike receptor binding domain  RBD  immunized animals  we identified two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb clones that have single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity  and generated a bispecific antibody. Lead antibodies showed strong inhibitory activity against historical SARS-CoV-2 and several emerging variants of concern. We solved several cryo-EM structures at ~3 Å resolution of these neutralizing antibodies in complex with prefusion spike trimer ectodomain  and revealed distinct epitopes  binding patterns  and conformations. The lead clones also showed potent efficacy in vivo against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. We also generated and characterized a humanized antibody to facilitate translation and drug development. The humanized clone also has strong potency against both the original virus and the B.1.617.2 Delta variant. These mAbs expand the repertoire of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

The recent emergence of viral variants with reduced sensitivity to some current antibodies and vaccines highlights the importance of broad cross-reactivity. This study describes deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalized COVID-19 patients using phage display technology and B cell receptor  BCR  repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralizing antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded a panel of potent neutralizing antibodies which bind distinct viral epitopes including epitopes conserved in SARS-CoV-1. Structural determination of a non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody reveals a previously undescribed binding epitope  which is unlikely to be affected by the mutations in any of the recently reported major viral variants including B.1.1.7  from the UK   B.1.351  from South Africa  and B.1.1.28  from Brazil . Finally  by combining sequences of the RBD binding and neutralizing antibodies with the B cell receptor repertoire sequencing  we also describe a highly convergent early antibody response. Similar IgM-derived sequences occur within this study group and also within patient responses described by multiple independent studies published previously.

Some mutations have defined several SARS-CoV-2 clades that seem to behave differently in terms of regional distribution and other biological features. Next-generation sequencing  NGS  approaches are used to classify the sequence variants in viruses from individual human patients. However  the cost and relative scarcity of NGS equipment and expertise in developing countries prevent studies aimed to associate specific clades and variants to clinical features and outcomes in such territories. As of March 2021  the GR clade and its derivatives  including the B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28 variants  predominate worldwide. We implemented the post-PCR small-amplicon high-resolution melting analysis to genotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from the saliva of individual patients. This procedure was able to clearly distinguish two groups of samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples predicted  according to their melting profiles  to contain GR and non-GR viruses. This grouping of the samples was validated by means of amplification-refractory mutation system  ARMS  assay as well as Sanger sequencing.

End of November 2021  a new SARS-CoV-2 variant namely the omicron  B.1.1.529  emerged. Since this omicron variant is heavily mutated in the spike protein  WHO classified this variant as the 5th variant of concern  VoC . We previously demonstrated that the ancestral strain and the other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in and cause a COVID19-like pathology in Syrian hamsters. We here wanted to explore the infectivity of the omicron variant in comparison to the ancestral D614G strain in the hamster model. Strikingly  in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant  a 3 log 10  lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ. Moreover  histopathological examination of the lungs from omicron-infected hamsters revealed no signs of peri-bronchial inflammation or bronchopneumonia.

Real-time reverse transcription PCR  RT-qPCR  is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples  the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples. Here  we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  reactions to achieve specific  rapid  30 min   and sensitive  <100 copies  fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab  NP  samples. When compared to RT-qPCR  positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98%  n = 41 42  concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87%  n = 59 68  concordance for the same samples. Importantly  the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR. We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type  WA1 2020   and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  alpha  variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR. RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-qPCR including isothermal amplification  speed  <30 min   reduced costs  and similar sensitivity and specificity.

The characterization of full‐length SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes is critical for understanding the origin and transmission pathways of the virus  as well as identifying mutations that affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus. We present an analysis of the mutation pattern and clade distribution of full‐length SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences obtained from specimens tested at Gazi University Medical Virology Laboratory. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens. Next‐generation sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on Illumina iSeq 100 platform. Raw sequencing data were processed to obtain full‐length genome sequences and variant calling was performed to analyze amino acid changes. Clade distribution was determined to understand the phylogenetic background in relation to global data. A total of 293 distinct mutations were identified  of which 152 missense  124 synonymous  12 noncoding  and 5 deletions. The most frequent mutations were P323L  nsp12   D614G  ORF2 S   and 2421C>T  5′‐untranslated region  found simultaneously in all sequences. Novel mutations were found in nsp12  V111A  H133R  Y453C  M626K  and ORF2 S  R995G  V1068L . Nine different Pangolin lineages were detected. The most frequently assigned lineage was B.1.1  17 sequences   followed by B.1  7 sequences  and B.1.1.36  3 sequences . Sequence information is essential for revealing genomic diversity. Mutations might have significant functional implications and analysis of these mutations provides valuable information for therapeutic and vaccine development studies. Our findings point to the introduction of the virus into Turkey through various sources and the subsequent spread of several key variants.

Focusing on the T cell response  we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses  using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains  both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals  the second dose boosted the quantity but not quality of the T cell response  while in convalescents the second dose helped neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees  with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants  confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose  and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.

Genetic modifications of SARS-CoV-2 or mice enable the mice susceptible to viral infection. Although neither is the natural situation  they are currently utilized to establish mouse infection models. Here we report a direct contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 in wild-type mice. The SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  replicated efficiently and induced significant pathological changes in lungs and tracheas  accompanied by elevated proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and sera. Mechanistically  the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  spike protein turned to a high binding affinity to mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  mACE2   allowing the mice highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  infection. Our work suggests that SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  expands the host range and therefore increases its transmission route without adapted mutation. As the wild house mice live with human populations quite closely  this possible transmission route could be potentially risky. In addition  because SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  is one of the major epidemic strains and the mACE2 in laboratory-used mice is naturally expressed and regulated  the SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351  mice could be a much convenient animal model system to study COVID-19 pathogenesis and evaluate antiviral inhibitors and vaccines.

Here we investigate the infectivity and antigenicity of ten emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants—B.1.1.298  B.1.1.7 Alpha   B.1.351 Beta   P.1 Gamma   P.2 Zeta   B.1.429 Epsilon   B.1.525 Eta   B.1.526-1 Iota   B.1.526-2 Iota   B.1.1.318—and seven corresponding single amino acid mutations in the receptor-binding domain using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The results indicate that the pseudovirus of most of the SARS-CoV-2 variants  except B.1.1.298  display slightly increased infectivity in human and monkey cell lines  especially B.1.351  B.1.525 and B.1.526 in Calu-3 cells. The K417N T  N501Y  or E484K-carrying variants exhibit significantly increased abilities to infect mouse ACE2-overexpressing cells. The activities of furin  TMPRSS2  and cathepsin L are increased against most of the variants. RBD amino acid mutations comprising K417T N  L452R  Y453F  S477N  E484K  and N501Y cause significant immune escape from 11 of 13 monoclonal antibodies. However  the resistance to neutralization by convalescent serum or vaccines elicited serum is mainly caused by the E484K mutation. The convalescent serum from B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-infected patients neutralized the variants themselves better than other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our study provides insights regarding therapeutic antibodies and vaccines  and highlights the importance of E484K mutation.

Clinical trial participants who received a two-dose primary series of the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 approximately 6 months earlier entered an open-label phase 2a study  NCT04405076  to evaluate the primary objectives of safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of mRNA-1273 or variant-modified mRNAs  including multivalent mRNA-1273.211. As the trial is currently ongoing  this exploratory interim analysis includes preliminary descriptive results only of four booster groups  n = 20 per group . Immediately before the booster dose  neutralizing antibodies against wild-type D614G virus had waned  P < 0.0001  relative to peak titers against wild-type D614G measured 1 month after the primary series  and neutralization titers against B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta  VOCs were either low or undetectable. Both the mRNA-1273 booster and variant-modified boosters were safe and well-tolerated. All boosters  including mRNA-1273  numerically increased neutralization titers against the wild-type D614G virus compared to peak titers against wild-type D614G measured 1 month after the primary series; significant increases were observed for mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.211  P < 0.0001 . In addition  all boosters increased neutralization titers against key VOCs and VOIs  including B.1.351  P.1. and B.1.617.2  that were statistically equivalent to peak titers measured after the primary vaccine series against wild-type D614G virus  with superior titers against some VOIs. This trial is ongoing.

Here  we profiled vRNA–host protein interactomes for three RNA virus pathogens  SARS-CoV-2  Zika  and Ebola viruses  using ChIRP-MS. Comparative interactome analyses discovered both common and virus-specific host responses and vRNA-associated proteins that variously promote or restrict viral infection. In particular  SARS-CoV-2 binds and hijacks the host factor IGF2BP1 to stabilize vRNA and augment viral translation. Our interactome-informed drug repurposing efforts identified several FDA-approved drugs  e.g.  Cepharanthine  as broad-spectrum antivirals in cells and hACE2 transgenic mice. A co-treatment comprising Cepharanthine and Trifluoperazine was highly potent against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Thus  our study illustrates the scientific and medical discovery utility of adopting a comparative vRNA–host protein interactome perspective.

We propose a statistical learning strategy  SLS  for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167 893 Spike protein sequences from US COVID-19 cases  excluding 21 391 sequences from VOI VOC strains  deposited at GISAID from January 19  2020 to March 15  2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants  VRVs   i.e.  residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next  generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics  to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics  false discovery rate q-value <0.01; maximum VRV proportion > 10% on at least one day . Unsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally  homology modelling was performed to gain insight into potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs  71 of which have not previously been observed in a VOI VOC  and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identifies 17 VRVs ~91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of 4 VRVs or more  suggesting two emerging strains  B1.1.222 and B.1.234 . Structural modeling supported potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations. The SLS approach equally monitors all Spike residues over time  independently of existing phylogenic classifications  and is complementary to existing genomic surveillance methods.

Within-host viral evolution was reported in treated immunocompromised individuals but whether this signifies a real risk of onward transmission is unclear. We used a regional SARS-CoV-2 sequencing program to monitor lineages with clinically relevant variants in identified patients  which facilitated analysis of parameters potentially relevant to new variant emergence. Here we describe a newly acquired spike E484K mutation detected within the B.1.311 lineage. Multiple individuals in two households of the same extended family were infected. The timing and patterns of spread were consistent with de novo emergence of this E484K variant in the bamlanivimab-treated index patient. Our study suggests that the selective pressures introduced by the widespread administration of these antibodies may warrant increased genomic surveillance to identify and mitigate spread of therapy-induced variants.

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Single and combination monoclonal antibody  mAb  therapeutics have received emergency use authorization 1 2   with more in the pipeline 3–6 . Furthermore  multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise 7   including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19 8 9 . However  these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since  including variants with a D614G mutation 10  that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct  however 11 . Recent emergence of new SARS- CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK 12  and B.1.351 in South Africa 13  is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain  NTD  of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain  RBD . It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma  ~3 fold  and vaccinee sera  ~2 fold . Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple individual mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD  largely due to an E484K mutation  although some mAb combinations retain activity. Moreover  B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma  ~11–33 fold  and vaccinee sera  ~6.5–8.6 fold . B.1.351 and emergent variants 14 15  with similar spike mutations present new challenges for mAb therapy and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines.

Rigorous control measures were introduced and could only be relaxed once the outbreak was declared over. Each day after the apparent outbreak end  we estimated the risk of future cases occurring  to inform decision-making. METHODS: Probabilistic transmission networks were reconstructed and transmission parameters  the reproduction number R and overdispersion parameter k  were estimated. We estimated the reporting delay during the outbreak  Scenario 1 . We also considered a counterfactual scenario with less effective interventions characterized by a longer reporting delay  Scenario 2 . Each day  we estimated the risk of future cases under both scenarios. RESULTS: The values of R and k were estimated to be 1.30  95% credible interval: 0.57 3.80  and 0.38  0.12 1.20   respectively. The mean reporting delays considered were 2.5 days  Scenario 1  and 7.8 days  Scenario 2 . The inferred probability of future cases occurring declined more quickly in Scenario 1 than Scenario 2. CONCLUSIONS: Following outbreak containment  rigorous control measures allowed the outbreak to be declared over quickly. This highlights the need for effective interventions  not only to reduce cases during outbreaks but also to allow outbreaks to be declared over with confidence.

For both B.1.1.7 and B.1351 variants  named as variants of concern  VOC   increased transmissibility was reported  whereas B.1.351 was more resistant to multiple monoclonal antibodies  mAbs   as well as convalescent and vaccination sera. To test this hypothesis  we examined the proportion of VOC over time across different geographic areas where the two VOC  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  co-circulate. Our comparative analysis was based on the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on GISAID database. We report that B.1.1.7 dominates over B.1.351 in geographic areas where both variants co-circulate and the B.1.1.7 was the first variant introduced in the population. The only areas where B.1.351 was detected at higher proportion were South Africa and Mayotte in Africa  where this strain was associated with increased community transmission before the detection of B.1.1.7. The dominance of B.1.1.7 over B.1.351 could be important since B.1.351 was more resistant to certain mAbs  as well as heterologous convalescent and vaccination sera  thus suggesting that it may be transmitted more effectively in people with pre-existing immunity to other VOC. This scenario would lessen the effectiveness of vaccine and urge the need to update them with new strains.

METHODS: We enrolled 30 lactating women who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from January through April 2021 in this cohort study. Women provided serial milk samples  including milk expressed before vaccination  across 2–3 weeks after the first dose  and across 3 weeks after the second dose. Women provided their blood  spotted on cards  dried blood spots   19 days after the first dose and 21 days after the second dose. Stool samples from the breastfed infants were collected 21 days after mothers' second vaccination. Prepandemic samples of milk  dried blood spots  and infant stool were used as controls. Milk  dried blood spots  and infant stool were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for receptor-binding domain  RBD –specific immunoglobulin  Ig A and IgG. Milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the spike and four variants of concern: D614G  Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Gamma  P.1 . Levels of 10 cytokines were measured in milk samples. RESULTS: Milk from COVID-19-immunized women neutralized the spike and four variants of concern  primarily driven by anti-RBD IgG. The immune response in milk also included significant elevation of interferon-γ. The immune response to maternal vaccination was reflected in breastfed infants: anti-RBD IgG and anti-RBD IgA were detected in 33% and 30% of infant stool samples  respectively. Levels of anti-RBD antibodies in infant stool correlated with maternal vaccine side effects. Median antibody levels against RBD were below the positive cutoffs in prepandemic milk and infant stool samples. CONCLUSION: Humoral and cellular immune responses to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination are present in most women’s breast milk. The milk anti-RBD antibodies can neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  spike and variants of concern. Anti-RBD antibodies are transferred to breastfed infants  with the potential to confer passive immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

PCR remains the standard benchmark for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 infection  while advances in immunological profiling are guiding clinical treatment. The SARS-Cov-2 virus has undergone multiple mutations since its emergence in 2019  resulting in changes in virulence that have impacted on disease severity globally. The emergence of more virulent variants of SARS-Cov-2 remains challenging for effective disease control during this pandemic. Major variants identified to date include B.1.1.7  B.1.351; P.1; B.1.617.2; B.1.427; P.2; P.3; B.1.525; and C.37. Globally  large unvaccinated populations increase the risk of more and more variants arising. With successive waves of COVID-19 emerging  strategies that mitigate against community transmission need to be implemented  including increased vaccination coverage. For treatment  convalescent plasma therapy  successfully deployed during recent Ebola outbreaks and for H1N1 influenza  can increase survival rates and improve host responses to viral challenge. Convalescent plasma is rich with cytokines  IL-1β  IL-2  IL-6  IL-17  and IL-8   CCL2  and TNFα  neutralizing antibodies  and clotting factors essential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials can inform and guide treatment policy  leading to mainstream adoption of convalescent therapy. This review examines the limited number of clinical trials published  to date that have deployed this therapy and explores clinical trials in progress for the treatment of COVID-19.

Recently  a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS‐CoV‐2  variant B.1.1.529 has been reported in South Africa and induced a rapid increase in COVID‐19 cases. On November 24  2021  B.1.1.529 named Omicron was designated as a variant under monitoring  VUM  by World Health Organization  WHO . Two days later  the Omicron variant was classified as a variant of concern  VOC . This variant harbors a high number of mutations  including 15 mutations in the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of spike. The Omicron variant also shares several mutations with the previous VOC Alpha  Beta  and Gamma variants  which immediately raised global concerns about viral transmissibility  pathogenicity  and immune evasion. Here we described the discovery and characteristics of the Omicron variant  compared the mutations of the spike in the five VOCs  and further raised possible strategies to prevent and overcome the prevalence of the Omicron variant.

While some variants spread only locally  others  referred to as variants of concern  disseminated globally and became drivers of the pandemic. All SARS-CoV-2 variants harbor mutations relative to the virus circulating early in the pandemic  and mutations in the viral spike  S  protein are considered of particular relevance since the S protein mediates host cell entry and constitutes the key target of the neutralizing antibody response. As a consequence  mutations in the S protein may increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and enable its evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore  mutations in the S protein can modulate viral transmissibility and pathogenicity.

Data are limited on the level of protection against hospitalization among disproportionately affected populations in the United States  particularly during periods in which the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  predominates  2 . U.S. veterans are older  more racially diverse  and have higher prevalences of underlying medical conditions than persons in the general U.S. population  2 4 . CDC assessed the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among 1 175 U.S. veterans aged ≥18 years hospitalized at five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers  VAMCs  during February 1-August 6  2021. Among these hospitalized persons  1 093  93.0%  were men  the median age was 68 years  574  48.9%  were non-Hispanic Black  Black   475 were non-Hispanic White  White   and 522  44.4%  had a Charlson comorbidity index score of ≥3  5 . Overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 86.8%  95% confidence interval [CI] = 80.4%-91.1%  and was similar before  February 1-June 30  and during  July 1-August 6  SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant predominance  84.1% versus 89.3%  respectively .

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalization in this older  racially diverse population of predominately male U.S. veterans. Additional evaluations of vaccine effectiveness among various age groups are warranted. To prevent COVID-19-related hospitalizations  all eligible persons should receive COVID-19 vaccination.

To understand the possible reason for these breakthroughs  we collected 677 clinical samples  throat swab nasal swabs  of individuals from 17 states Union Territories of the country who had received two doses  n = 592  and one dose  n = 85  of vaccines and tested positive for COVID-19. These cases were telephonically interviewed and clinical data were analyzed. A total of 511 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were recovered with genome coverage of higher than 98% from both groups. Analysis of both groups determined that 86.69%  n = 443  of them belonged to the Delta variant  along with Alpha  Kappa  Delta AY.1  and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into four distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage I had mutations in ORF1ab A1306S  P2046L  P2287S  V2930L  T3255I  T3446A  G5063S  P5401L  and A6319V  and in N G215C; Sub-lineage II had mutations in ORF1ab P309L  A3209V  V3718A  G5063S  P5401L  and ORF7a L116F; Sub-lineage III had mutations in ORF1ab A3209V  V3718A  T3750I  G5063S  and P5401L and in spike A222V; Sub-lineage IV had mutations in ORF1ab P309L  D2980N  and F3138S and spike K77T. This study indicates that majority of the breakthrough COVID-19 clinical cases were infected with the Delta variant  and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization  while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality.

The alpha variant  B.1.1.7   first seen in Kent United Kingdom  has increased the R‑value and therefore the infectiousness by 75%; however  the effectiveness of the vaccines against SARS-CoV‑2 available in Germany seems to be only slightly impaired by these mutations. In the case of the beta variant  B.1.351   first described in South Africa  the neutralization ability of antibodies towards SARS-CoV‑2 is decreased. The monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab and etesivimab  which are used therapeutically  are ineffective. The AstraZeneca vaccine offers almost no protection against mild or moderate disease caused by the beta variant. The gamma variant  P.1 or B.1.1.28.1   which was first found in Brazil  is probably 1.7–2.6 times more transmissible than previous virus strains circulating in Brazil. In addition to the infectiousness  the mortality risk of the gamma variant also seems to be increased between 1.2 and 1.9-fold in adults and between 5 and 8-fold in young persons. The delta variant  B.1.617   first described in India  is now dominant in most countries. It is 50% more infectious than the alpha variant  and the protective effect of vaccinations against symptomatic disease can be decreased  Biontech: delta variant 88%  alpha variant 93.7%; AstraZeneca: delta variant 67%  alpha variant 74.5% . Furthermore  the course of the disease with the delta variant is often more severe than with the wild type. Disease courses with the delta variant are less severe in vaccinated than in nonvaccinated persons  and fatal outcomes are substantially rarer. A high vaccination rate is essential in order to approach herd immunity and to bring the pandemic under control. Even where the protective effect towards mild or moderate disease is decreased  as a rule  vaccination still offers excellent protection against life-threatening and fatal disease courses.

The B.1.1.7 variant  which emerged in England during December 2020  is associated with increased infectivity. Therefore its pattern of spread is of great importance. The Israeli government established three national programs: massive RT-PCR testing  focused surveillance in nursing homes and robust prioritized vaccination with BNT162b2. To define the impact of the aforementioned programs  we analyze data from ∼300 000 RT-PCR samples collected from December 6th 2020 to February 10th 2021. We reveal that the B.1.1.7 is 45%  95% CI:20-60%  more transmissible than the wild-type strain  and become the dominant in Israel within 3.5 weeks. Despite the rapid increase in viral spread  focused RT-PCR testing and prioritized vaccination programs are capable of preventing the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in the elderly. Therefore  proactive surveillance combined with prioritized vaccination are achievable  and reduce severe illness and subsequent death.

However  currently approved vaccines cannot meet the global demand. In addition  none of the currently used vaccines is administered intranasally to potentially induce mucosal immunity. Here  we tested the safety and immunogenicity of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that includes a stabilized spike antigen and can be administered intranasally. The vaccine is based on a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stabilized in a prefusion conformation with six beneficial proline substitutions  AVX COVID-12-HEXAPRO; Patria . Immunogenicity testing in the pig model showed that both intranasal and intramuscular application of the vaccine as well as a combination of the two induced strong serum neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore  substantial reactivity to B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 spike variants was detected. Finally  no adverse reactions were found in the experimental animals at any dose level or delivery route. These results indicate that the experimental vaccine AVX COVID-12-HEXAPRO  Patria  is safe and highly immunogenic in the pig model.

Therefore  antiviral drugs that efficiently reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication or alleviate COVID-19 symptoms are urgently needed. Inhaled glucocorticoids are currently being discussed in the context of treatment for COVID-19  partly based on a previous study that reported reduced recovery times in cases of mild COVID-19 after inhalative administration of the glucocorticoid budesonide. Given various reports that describe the potential antiviral activity of glucocorticoids against respiratory viruses  we aimed to analyze a potential antiviral activity of budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.351  beta . We demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 that was comparable between all viral variants tested while cell viability remains unaffected. Our results are encouraging as they could indicate a multimodal mode of action of budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19  which could contribute to an improved clinical performance.

Moreover  currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were shown to be less effective against new variants  in particular  the South African  SA  variant  termed 501Y.V2 or B.1.351. To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against the SA variant  we sought to perform as in vitro binding and neutralization assays  and in vivo animal studies. CT-P59 neutralized B.1.1.7 variant to a similar extent as to wild type virus. CT-P59 showed reduced binding affinity against a RBD  receptor binding domain  triple mutant containing mutations defining B.1.351  K417N E484K N501Y  also showed reduced potency against the SA variant in live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assay systems. However  in vivo ferret challenge studies demonstrated that a therapeutic dosage of CT-P59 was able to decrease B.1.351 viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts  comparable to that observed for the wild type virus. Overall  although CT-P59 showed reduced in vitro neutralizing activity against the SA variant  sufficient antiviral effect in B.1.351-infected animals was confirmed with a clinical dosage of CT-P59  suggesting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients infected with SA variant.

MicroRNAs  miRNA  play an emerging and important role in the interplay between viruses and host cells. Although the impact of host miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted  experimental data are still missing. This study started by a bioinformatics prediction of cellular miRNAs potentially targeting viral RNAs; then  a number of criteria also based on experimental evidence and virus biology were applied  giving rise to eight promising binding miRNAs. Their interaction with viral sequences was experimentally validated by transfecting luciferase-based reporter plasmids carrying viral target sequences or their inverted sequences into the lung A549 cell line. Transfection of the reporter plasmids resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity for five out of the eight potential binding sites  suggesting responsiveness to endogenously expressed miRNAs. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmids along with miRNA mimics led to a further and strong reduction of luciferase activity  validating the interaction between miR-219a-2-3p  miR-30c-5p  miR-378d  miR-29a-3p  miR-15b-5p  and viral sequences. miR-15b was also able to repress plasmid-driven Spike expression. Intriguingly  the viral target sequences are fully conserved in more recent variants such as United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 and South Africa 501Y.V2. Overall  this study provides a first experimental evidence of the interaction between specific cellular miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 sequences  thus contributing to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying virus infection and pathogenesis to envisage innovative therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools.

Adults and children older than 2 months with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled from May to October in Porto Alegre  Brazil. All participants performed RT-PCR assay  and samples with S gene dropout and cycle threshold < 30 were submitted to high-throughput sequencing  HTS . 484 out of 1 557 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The S gene dropout was detected in 7.4%  36 484  and a peak was observed in August. The B.1.1.28  B.1.91 and B.1.1.33 lineages were circulating in early pandemic. The RBD novel mutation  Y380Q  was found in one sample occurring simultaneously with C379W and V395A  and the B.1.91 lineage in the spike protein.

Recently  in addition to the B.1.1.7 lineage  which shows 25% abundance  an R.1 lineage carrying the E484K mutation in the spike protein was found to show up to 40% predominance. E484K could be a pivotal amino acid substitution with the potential to mediate immune escape; thus  more attention should be paid to such potential variants of concern to avoid the emergence of mutants of concern. Such comprehensive real-time genome surveillance has become essential for the containment of COVID-19 clusters.

However  some individuals present long-term viral shedding. We monitored 38 individuals who were mildly affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Out of the total studied population  three  7.9%  showed atypical events regarding the duration of positivity for viral RNA detection. In one of these atypical cases  a previously HIV-positive male patient presented a SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and subgenomic RNA  sgRNA  detected from the upper respiratory tract  respectively  for 232 and 224 days after the onset of the symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.28 lineage  one of the most prevalent in Brazil in 2020  was identified in this patient in three serial samples. Interestingly  the genomic analyses performed throughout the infectious process showed an increase in the genetic diversity of the B.1.1.28 lineage within the host itself  with viral clearance occurring naturally  without any intervention measures to control the infection. Contrasting widely spread current knowledge  our results indicate that potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus might be shed by much longer periods by some infected patients. This data call attention to better adapted non-pharmacological measures and clinical discharge of patients aiming at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the population.

Here we report assessment of the Abbot BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test. Using genetically sequenced remnant clinical samples collected from individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2  we assessed the performance of BinaxNOW against the variants that currently pose public health threats. We measured the limit of detection of BinaxNOW against various VOC I in a blinded manner. BinaxNOW successfully detected the Omicron  B.1.1.529   Mu  B.1.621   Delta  B.1.617.2   Lambda  C.37   Gamma  P.1   Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  1.351   Eta  B.1.525   and P.2 variants and at low viral concentrations. BinaxNOW also detected the Omicron variant in individual remnant clinical samples. Overall  these data indicate that this inexpensive and simple-to-use  FDA-authorized and broadly distributed rapid test can reliably detect Omicron  Delta  and other VOC I.

Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in the region of a major transport hub in Germany  we characterized the viral sequence diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Frankfurt am Main  the city with the largest airport in Germany  from the end of October to the end of December 2020. Methods: In total  we recovered 136 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nasopharyngeal swab samples. We isolated 104 isolates that were grown in cell culture and RNA from the recovered viruses and subjected them to full-genome sequence analysis. In addition  32 nasopharyngeal swab samples were directly sequenced. Results and conclusion: We found 28 different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating during the study period  including the variant of concern B.1.1.7  Δ69 70  N501Y . Six of the lineages had not previously been observed in Germany. We detected the spike protein  S  deletion Δ69 Δ70 in 15% of all sequences  a four base pair  bp  deletion  in 2.9% of sequences  and a single bp deletion  in 0.7% of sequences  in ORF3a  leading to ORF3a truncations. In four sequences  2.9%   an amino acid deletion at position 210 in S was identified. In a single sample  0.7%   both a 9 bp deletion in ORF1ab and a 7 bp deletion in ORF7a were identified. One sequence in lineage B.1.1.70 had an N501Y substitution while lacking the Δ69 70 in S. The high diversity of sequences observed over two months in Frankfurt am Main highlights the persisting need for continuous SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using full-genome sequencing  particularly in cities with international airport connections.

We evaluated immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  in people taking methotrexate and biologics. Given the roll out of extended interval vaccination programmes to maximise population coverage  we present findings following the first dose. We recruited individuals with psoriasis  n=84  established on methotrexate or biologic monotherapy  TNF  IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors  and healthy controls  n=17 . Immunogenicity was evaluated pre and post  day 28  vaccine. Seroconversion rates were lower in patients taking immunosuppression  78%  95%CI 67-87%  compared to controls  100%  95%CI 79-100%   with the lowest rate in those on methotrexate  50%  95%CI 26-74% . Neutralising activity to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was lower in patients receiving methotrexate  median ID50 152  IQR 47-257  compared to controls  median ID50 316  IQR 212-481  p<0.01   but preserved in those receiving biologics  median ID50 280  IQR 137-428 . Neutralising titres against B.1.1.7 were comparably low in all participants. Spike-specific T cell responses  including IFNγ  IL-2  IL-21  were induced in all groups  and were equivalent among individuals receiving methotrexate  biologics and controls. Functional humoral immunity to a single dose of BNT162b2 is impaired by methotrexate but not by biologics  while cellular responses are unaffected. Seroconversion alone may not adequately reflect vaccine immunogenicity in individuals with immune-mediated disease receiving immunosuppression. Real-world pharmacovigilance studies will determine whether these findings translate to clinical effectiveness.

We correlated sensitivity data of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests  RATs  to viral RNA genome equivalents assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR . Further  we checked their suitability for testing animals by assessing saliva and VOC effects. Viral loads up to 2 logs  RNA copy number  under the hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 infectivity threshold were detected by most analyzed RATs. However  while saliva from various animal species showed generally no adverse effects on the RATs’ analytical sensitivities  the detection of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 was in some RATs inferior to non-VOC viruses.

The emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7   South Africa  B1.351  and Brazil  P.1  requires a vigorous public health response  including real time strain surveillance on a global scale. Although new SARS-CoV-2 variants can be most accurately identified by genomic sequencing  this approach is time consuming and expensive. A simple and more rapid screen for the key SARS-CoV-2 mutations that define variant strains is needed. We developed a simple  rapid and high-throughput reverse-transcriptase PCR  RT-PCR  melting temperature assay that identifies the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation  a key mutation which is present in all three known variant strains of concern. METHODS. RT-PCR primers and two sloppy molecular beacon  SMB  probes were designed to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y  A23063T  mutation. One SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the wild type sequence  WT  and a second SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the mutant  MT  sequence. Each SMB was labeled with a different fluorophore  and the assay was performed in a single test well. After RT-PCR  WT versus MT SARS-CoV-2 was identified by a characteristic shift in the melting temperature  Tm  of each SMB. Assay optimization and testing was performed with RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1 2020  WT  and SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19 England 204820464 2020  a B.1.17 variant . The assay was then validated using clinical samples. RESULTS. The limit of detection  LOD  of the assay for both the WT and the B1.1.7 variant was 4 genomic copies reaction. The two SMBs produced Tm shifts that were 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying the N501Y mutation in cultured virus and in clinical samples as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSION. We have developed a rapid screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation  which is a characteristic of all three SARS-CoV-2 stains of global concern. This assay can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples for these variants  providing an early warning for the emergence and spread of these strains of concern.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the first detection of variant N.9 in Rio de Janeiro State. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 N.9 was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  qRT-PCR   whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. FINDINGS: Here  we report two SARS-CoV-2 N.9 lineage strains in Rio de Janeiro. One of them had only the E484K substitution of the six N.9 lineage-defining mutations. Other three strains pre-defined as N.9 have the same genomic profile. These four strains are grouped within the B.1.1.33 lineage and basal to the N.9 lineage in our phylogenetic analysis  and we call them “N.9-like B.1.1.33 + E484K”. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic analysis shows four independent introductions of N.9 in the state of Rio de Janeiro in October and December 2020  January and March 2021. SARS-CoV-2 N.9 dissemination in the Rio de Janeiro could have been limited by the emergence and dominance of other variants  mainly by the lineage P.2 VOI Zeta that emerged in the same period and co-circulated with N.9  as observed in the neighboring State of São Paulo.

We identify four receptor-binding domain targeting antibodies from three early-outbreak convalescent donors with potent neutralizing activity against 12 variants including the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs. Two of them are ultrapotent  with sub-nanomolar neutralization titers  IC 50  <0.0006 to 0.0102 μg mL; IC80 < 0.0006 to 0.0251 μg mL . We define the structural and functional determinants of binding for all four VOC-targeting antibodies  and show that combinations of two antibodies decrease the in vitro generation of escape mutants  suggesting potential means to mitigate resistance development. These results define the basis of therapeutic cocktails against VOCs and suggest that targeted boosting of existing immunity may increase vaccine breadth against VOCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Positive cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in a single military base  March 23  2020 and February 16  2021  were included. An epidemiological investigation conducted via phone included questions regarding symptoms  exposure history  smoking status  list of contacts  and recently visited places. Symptoms surveyed included fever  cough  shortness of breath  sore throat  loss of smell or taste  gastrointestinal symptoms  GI   headache  chest pain  and constitutional symptoms. Cases were divided before B.1.1.7 first reported case in Israel  December 23  2020   period 1  and after its identification  period 2 . Symptom distribution and the risk of a contact to be infected were compared between the periods  using a chi-square test  and a negative binominal regression model  respectively. RESULTS: Of 293 confirmed cases  89 were reported in the first period and 204 in the second. 56.0% were men with a median age of 19.5 years  interquartile range 18.6-20.5 . GI symptoms  loss of taste or smell  headache  fever  and chills were more prevalent in the first period  P < .001  P = .026  P = .034  P = .001  and P < .001  respectively   while fatigue was more common in the second period  P = .008 . The risk of a contact to be infected was three times higher in the second period  relative risk = 3.562 [2.414-5.258] . CONCLUSION: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in young healthy adults  during a period with high national-wide B.1.1.7 variant prevalence  is characterized by decreased prevalence of fever  loss of taste or smell and GI symptoms  increased reports of fatigue  and more infected contacts for each index case.

We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2  tozinameran  Pfizer–BioNTech  against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study  we analysed electronic health records of individuals  ≥12 years  who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California  CA  USA   to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04848584. FINDINGS: Between Dec 14  2020  and Aug 8  2021  of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility  we included 3 436 957  median age 45 years [IQR 29–61]; 1 799 395 [52·4%] female and 1 637 394 [47·6%] male . For fully vaccinated individuals  effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73%  95% CI 72–74  and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90%  89–92 . Effectiveness against infections declined from 88%  95% CI 86–89  during the first month after full vaccination to 47%  43–51  after 5 months. Among sequenced infections  vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination  93% [95% CI 85–97]  but declined to 53% [39–65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other  non-delta  variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97%  95% CI 95–99   but waned to 67%  45–80  at 4–5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall  93% [95% CI 84–96]  up to 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated  even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection. FUNDING: Pfizer.

We developed a live intranasal vector vaccine for infants and children against COVID-19 based on replication-competent chimeric bovine human parainfluenza virus type 3  B HPIV3  that express the native  S  or prefusion-stabilized  S-2P  SARS-CoV-2 S spike protein  the major protective and neutralization antigen of SARS-CoV-2. B HPIV3 S and B HPIV3 S-2P replicated as efficiently as B HPIV3 in vitro and stably expressed SARS-CoV-2 S. Prefusion stabilization increased S expression by B HPIV3 in vitro. In hamsters  a single intranasal dose of B HPIV3 S-2P induced significantly higher titers compared to B HPIV3 S of serum SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibodies  12-fold higher   serum IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S protein  5-fold and 13-fold   and IgG to the receptor binding domain  10-fold . Antibodies exhibited broad neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 of lineages A  B.1.1.7  and B.1.351. Four weeks after immunization  hamsters were challenged intranasally with 10 4.5  50% tissue-culture infectious-dose  TCID 50   of SARS-CoV-2. In B HPIV3 empty vector-immunized hamsters  SARS-CoV-2 replicated to mean titers of 10 6.6  TCID 50  g in lungs and 10 7  TCID 50  g in nasal tissues and induced moderate weight loss. In B HPIV3 S-immunized hamsters  SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus was reduced 20-fold in nasal tissues and undetectable in lungs. In B HPIV3 S-2P–immunized hamsters  infectious challenge virus was undetectable in nasal tissues and lungs; B HPIV3 S and B HPIV3 S-2P completely protected against weight loss after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. B HPIV3 S-2P is a promising vaccine candidate to protect infants and young children against HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2.

Using pseudotyped virus  we examine the capacity of convalescent sera  from a well-defined cohort of healthcare workers  HCW  and Patients infected during the first wave from a national critical care centre in the UK to neutralise B.1.1.298  variants of interest  VOI  B.1.617.1  Kappa   and four VOCs  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta   including the B.1.617.2 K417N  informally known as Delta Plus. We utilised the WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin to report neutralisation antibody levels in International Units per mL. Our data demonstrate a significant reduction in the ability of first wave convalescent sera to neutralise the VOCs. Patients and HCWs with more severe COVID-19 were found to have higher antibody titres and to neutralise the VOCs more effectively than individuals with milder symptoms. Using an estimated threshold for 50% protection  54 IU mL  we found most asymptomatic and mild cases did not produce titres above this threshold.

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC  that carry multiple mutations in the viral spike protein can exhibit neutralisation resistance  potentially impacting the effectiveness of some antibody-based therapeutics. Here  generation of a diverse panel of 91 human neutralising monoclonal antibodies provides an in-depth structural and phenotypic definition of receptor binding domain  RBD  antigenic sites on the viral spike. These RBD antibodies ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamster models in a dose-dependent manner and in proportion to in vitro neutralising potency. Assessing the impact of mutations in the spike protein on antibody recognition and neutralisation highlights both potent single antibodies and stereotypic classes of antibodies that are unaffected by currently circulating VOC such as B.1.351 and P.1. These neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  and others that bind analogous epitopes  represent potentially useful future anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Despite several reports that whole genome sequencing  WGS  and haplotype networks are useful for epidemiologic analysis  little is known about their use in nosocomial infections. AIM: We aimed to demonstrate the advantages of genetic epidemiology in identifying the link in nosocomial infection by comparing single nucleotide variations  SNVs  of isolates from patients associated with an outbreak in Showa University Hospital. METHODS: We used specimens from 32 patients in whom COVID-19 had been diagnosed using clinical reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 from specimens was reverse-transcribed and analysed using WGS. SNVs were extracted and used for lineage determination  phylogenetic tree analysis  and median-joining analysis. FINDINGS: The lineage of SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with outbreak in Showa University Hospital was B.1.1.214  which was consistent with that found in the Kanto metropolitan area during the same period. Consistent with canonical epidemiological observations  haplotype network analysis was successful for the classification of patients. Additionally  phylogenetic tree analysis revealed three independent introductions of the virus into the hospital during the outbreak. Further  median-joining analysis indicated that four patients were directly infected by any of the others in the same cluster. CONCLUSION: Genetic epidemiology with WGS and haplotype networks is useful for tracing transmission and optimizing prevention strategies in nosocomial outbreaks.

Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine  Covax-19™ . A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain  ECD  was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL 6 and BALB c mice. Covax-19 vaccine induced high spike protein binding antibody levels that neutralised the original lineage B.1.319 virus from which the vaccine spike protein was derived  as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. Covax-19 vaccine also induced a high frequency of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype associated with the ability to kill spike-labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain  RBD  IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus given two weeks after the last immunisation. Notably  ferrets that received the two higher doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge  suggesting that in addition to lung protection  Covax-19 vaccine may have the potential to reduce virus transmission. This data supports advancement of Covax-19 vaccine into human clinical trials.

In April 2021  the Chicago Department of Public Health  CDPH  was notified of a large cluster of students with COVID-19 at an urban university after spring break. A total of 158 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed among undergraduate students during March 15-May 3  2021; the majority  114; 72.2%  lived in on-campus dormitories. CDPH evaluated the role of travel and social connections  as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants  on transmission. Among 140 infected students who were interviewed  89  63.6%  reported recent travel outside Chicago during spring break  and 57  40.7%  reported indoor social exposures. At the time of the outbreak  undergraduate-aged persons were largely ineligible for vaccination in Chicago; only three of the students with COVID-19  1.9%  were fully vaccinated. Whole genome sequencing  WGS  of 104 specimens revealed multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages  suggesting several nearly simultaneous introductions. Most specimens  66; 63.5%  were B.1.1.222  a lineage not widely detected in Chicago before or after this outbreak. These results demonstrate the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks on university campuses after widespread student travel during breaks  at the beginning of new school terms  and when students participate in indoor social gatherings. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission  colleges and universities should encourage COVID-19 vaccination; discourage unvaccinated students from travel  including during university breaks; implement serial COVID-19 screening among unvaccinated persons after university breaks; encourage masking; and implement universal serial testing for students based on community transmission levels.

Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained and requirement for ethical approval was waived by the local research ethics service. All pregnant or recently pregnant patients  within 6 weeks post-partum  within our health board area with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 16 March 2020 and 18 December 2020 were retrospectively identified from regional infection surveillance and local obstetric unit reports. Residential area deprivation was classified using the Scottish Index for Multiple Deprivation  SIMD   with quintile 1 representing the most deprived and quintile 5 representing the least deprived areas. R version 4.0.3  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  was used to perform analyses. Results: Over the study period  97 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparison between those in the lowest and highest SIMD quintiles is as shown below. Those from a black or ethnic minority background accounted for 31.9% of positive test results and 50% of admissions to critical care. [Formula presented] Discussion: In this cohort of obstetric patients  mothers from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas accounted for a higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases  and hospital   critical care admissions  than those from more affluent areas. This is  to our knowledge  the first study to investigate this association in obstetric patients. The relationship demonstrated between ethnicity  deprivation and SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigation and may have implications for future resource allocation and service planning.

He was transferred to the designated hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The patient was diagnosed as a mild COVID-19 case on January 16. After medical treatment  this patient recovered and left the hospital on February 18. Viral RNA from the specimen of the patient was extracted using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit  Qiagen  Valencia  CA  USA  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing approach were applied. The viral genome was reverse-transcribed and amplified using ULSEN® 2019-nCoV Whole Genome Kit  Micro Future . The sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit. The final viral-enriched libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The whole genome sequence of this COVID-19 virus strain  designated SCSR-455  was assembled and obtained using Geneious v11.0.3  https:  www.geneious.com . The published genomes from GISAID and the genome of SCSR-455 were aligned with the reference genome  Wuhan-Hu-1  Genbank: NC_045512  GISAID: EPI_ISL_402125   1  using MAFFT v7.4  2 . The maximum likelihood  ML  phylogeny was estimated with IQ-TREE v1.6.12  3  with 1000 bootstraps and the best-fit model autodetected. The genomes of SCSR-455 had the single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  8782T and 28144C which represent the Pangolin A lineage  4 . The A lineage was prevalent during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China  5 . So far  however  it has been less frequently detected than the B lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SCSR-455 was located in the Pangolin lineage A.27 which was designated in February 2021. This lineage of COVID-19 viruses was first detected in Denmark on December 14  2020 and then transmitted to several other countries  including Belgium  France  Netherlands  Nigeria  Rwanda  Switzerland  the United Kingdom  UK   and Turkey  Figure 1 . Apart from 8782T and 28144C  viruses in the A.27 lineage had 21 SNPs  A361G  C1122T  C2509T  A9204G  A11217G  C16466T  A18366G  A20262G  C21614T  G22468T  T22917G  A23063T  C23520T  C23525T  G23948T  G25218T  T25541C  C27247T  A28273T  G28878A  and G29742A  compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. The genomes of SCSR-455 shared all these lineage-defining SNPs with the A.27 lineage strains and also had another 6 SNPs  including C3096T  C5974T  C12241T  C16293T  C19895T  and C21658T. The genomes of 4 strains of the A.27 lineage  collected in France  EPI_ISL_934974   Rwanda  EPI_ISL_1020288   and the UK  EPI_ISL_769875 and EPI_ISL_769876   respectively  shared 26 SNPs with SCSR-455. These 4 strains were phylogenetically most closely related to SCSR-455 within the A.27 lineage  Figure 1 . A total of 7 amino acid mutation sites  L18F  L452R  N501Y  A653V  H655Y  D796Y  and G1219V  that correspond to the features of the A.27 lineage were detected in the spike protein of SCSR-455. The A.27 is the first sub-lineage of the A lineage that evolved to obtain N501Y mutation in the spike protein  despite the amino acid mutation D614G which might increase viral transmissibility  6  not being identified. Residue 501 is a key contact residue within the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and the N501Y mutation has been shown to enhance binding affinity to human and murine hACE2  7–8 . N501Y has been associated with some faster-growing COVID-19 virus lineages throughout the world  e.g.  the UK lineage B.1.1.7  also known as the 501Y.V1;and the South African lineage B.1.351  also known as the 501Y.V2 . The A.27 lineage shared only one amino acid mutation  N501Y  with the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 lineage. In Addition  the A.27 lineage obtained the L452R mutation  which might alter the antibody recognition sites  and D796Y  which might be associated with changes in ligand binding surface. The strain SCSR-455 is the first imported A.27 lineage variant in China. Previous investigations showed that the A lineage was less prevalent than the B lineage. Given the importance of N501Y in the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19  ongoing epidemiological and genomic surveillance are needed to monitor the potential expanded transmission of the A lineage. Further laboratory investigations are required to test the efficiency of the existing vaccines against this newly described A.27 lineage.

Although a number of vaccines have been deployed  the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular  the emerging variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1  first detected in the UK  South Africa and Brazil  respectively  have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization 1–3 . One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs  variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody  also known as nanobodies    which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies 4 . Here  we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas  dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD–ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However  nanobodies in group 2 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers  and—to our knowledge—rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore  although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge  nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.

To further develop the use of WBE  a multiplex digital polymerase chain reaction  dPCR  assay was optimized  validated and applied for the measurement of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC  in influent wastewater  IWW  samples. Key mutations were targeted in the different VOC strains  including SΔ69 70 deletion  N501Y  SΔ241 and SΔ157. The presented bioanalytical method was able to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 RNA originating from the wild-type and B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 variants. The dPCR assay proved to be sensitive enough to detect low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW since the limit of detection of the different targets ranged between 0.3 and 2.9 copies µL. This developed WBE approach was applied to IWW samples originating from different Belgian locations and was able to monitor spatio-temporal changes in the presence of targeted VOC strains in the investigated communities. The present dPCR assay developments were realized to bring added-value to the current national WBE of COVID-19 by also having the spatio-temporal proportions of the VoC in presence in the wastewaters.

Recently  three SARS-CoV-2 lineages  B.1.1.7  501Y.V1   B.1.351  501Y.V2  and B.1.1.28.1  P.1   have emerged in the United Kingdom  South Africa and Brazil  respectively. Here  we have presented global viewpoint on implications of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants based on structural–function impact of crucial mutations occurring in its spike  S   ORF8 and nucleocapsid  N  proteins. While the N501Y mutation was observed in all three lineages  the 501Y.V1 and P.1 accumulated a different set of mutations in the S protein. The missense mutational effects were predicted through a COVID-19 dedicated resource followed by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Current findings indicate that some mutations in the S protein might lead to higher affinity with host receptors and resistance against antibodies  but not all are due to different antibody binding  epitope  regions. Mutations may  however  result in diagnostic tests failures and possible interference with binding of newly identified anti-viral candidates against SARS-CoV-2  likely necessitating roll out of recurring “flu-like shots” annually for tackling COVID-19. The functional relevance of these mutations has been described in terms of modulation of host tropism  antibody resistance  diagnostic sensitivity and therapeutic candidates. Besides global economic losses  post-vaccine reinfections with emerging variants can have significant clinical  therapeutic and public health impacts.

Many new SARS-CoV-2 variants appeared during its transmission. In the present study  the Delta variants  B.1.617.2  of SARS-CoV-2  which have appeared in many countries  were considered for analysis. In order to evaluate the evolutionary divergence of the Delta variants B.1.617.2   the codon usage divergence in Delta variants  B.1.617.2  of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to that of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes emerged before June 2020. All Delta variants  B.1.617.2  and 350 early genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the NCBI database were downloaded. Codon usage pattern including the basic composition  the GC ratio of the third position  GC3  and the first two positions  GC12  in codons  overall GC contents  the effective number of codons  ENC   the codon bias index  CBI   the relative synonymous codon usage  RSCU  values  etc.  of all concerned important gene sequences were all calculated. Codon usage divergence of them was calculated via summing their standard deviations. The results suggested that base compositions in both Delta variants  B.1.617.2  of SARS-CoV-2 and the early SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar to each other. However  the internal codon usage divergence for most genes in Delta variants  B.1.617.2  was significantly wider than that of SARS-CoV-2. The RSCU values were further used to explore the synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the sequences of the Delta variants  B.1.617.2   and the results showed the synonymous mutations are more obvious than the non-synonymous in the concerned sequences. The related codon usage divergence analysis is helpful for further study on the adaptability and disease prognosis of the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We identified that SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Brazil with mutations of concern in the RBD independently acquired convergent deletions and insertions in the NTD of the S protein  which altered the NTD antigenic-supersite and other predicted epitopes at this region. Importantly  we detected the community transmission of different P.1 lineages bearing NTD indels ∆69-70  which can impact several SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic protocols   ∆144 and ins214ANRN  and a new VOI N.10 derived from the B.1.1.33 lineage carrying three NTD deletions  ∆141–144  ∆211  and ∆256–258 . These findings support that the ongoing widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil generates new viral lineages that might be more resistant to antibody neutralization than parental variants of concern.

We analysed data from putative household infector - infectee pairs in the Virus Watch Community cohort study to assess the serial interval of COVID-19 and whether this was affected by emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant. Methods: The Virus Watch study is an online  prospective  community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Putative household infector-infectee pairs were identified where more than one person in the household had a positive swab matched to an illness episode. Data on whether or not individual infections were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant were not available. We therefore developed a classification system based on the percentage of cases estimated to be due to B.1.1.7 in national surveillance data for different English regions and study weeks. Results: Out of 24 887 illnesses reported  915 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 186 likely ‘infector-infectee’ pairs in 186 households amongst 372 individuals were identified. The mean COVID-19 serial interval was 3.18  95%CI: 2.55 - 3.81  days. There was no significant difference  p=0.267  between the mean serial interval for VOC hotspots  mean = 3.64 days   95%CI: 2.55 – 4.73   days and non-VOC hotspots   mean = 2.72 days   95%CI: 1.48 – 3.96  . Conclusions: Our estimates of the average serial interval of COVID-19 are broadly similar to estimates from previous studies and we find no evidence that B.1.1.7 is associated with a change in serial intervals. Alternative explanations such as increased viral load  longer period of viral shedding or improved receptor binding may instead explain the increased transmissibility and rapid spread and should undergo further investigation.

All the subjects received BNT162b2 vaccination. D1 inf  NtAbT increased significantly with respect to BL inf  against both B.1 and P.1 variants  with a fold-change significantly higher for P.1. D1 inf  NtAbT were significantly higher than D2 uninf  NtAbT  against B.1 and P.1. NtAbT against the two strains were highly correlated. P.1 NtAbT were significantly higher than B.1 NtAbT. This difference was significant for post-vaccination sera in infected and uninfected subjects. A single-dose BNT162b2 vaccination substantially boosted the NtAb response to both variants in the previously infected subjects. NtAb titers to B.1 and P.1 lineages were highly correlated  suggesting substantial cross-neutralization. Higher titers to the P.1 than to the B.1 strain were driven by the post-vaccination titers  highlighting that cross-neutralization can be enhanced by vaccination.

One of the latest variations  SARS-CoV-2 delta  B.1.617.2 variant of concern  VOC  formerly  has become the most prevalent type of SARS-CoV-2 in many countries [1]. It identified following an upsurge in the western part of India since January 2021. More detailed analysis disclosed that the prevailing lineage in distribution is a novel identified lineage B.1.617 holding in common signature mutations D111D  G142D  L452R  E484Q  D614G  and P681R  in the spike protein  containing within the receptor-binding domain  RBD  [2  3]. Following the initial high mortality rate of this variation in India as its hostess  as the growing number of fatal reports from several countries regarding its transfer to most parts of world in recent months  Delta variation was known as the deadliest COVID-19 [4  5  6]. According to official statistics  the mortality rate in individuals in areas where the Delta variant has become dominant is much higher than the same period and the epidemic with previous COVID-19 lineages. The enigma here is  does this mean more lethality of this variant?

Virus neutralization and epidemiological efficacy drop obtained for several vaccines against the B.1.1.7  B.1.351 P.1  and B.1.617 genotypes are of concern. There is a growing number of reports on mutations in receptor-binding domain  RBD  increasing the transmissibility of the virus and escaping the neutralizing effect of antibodies. The Sputnik V vaccine is currently approved for use in more than 66 countries but its activity against variants of concern  VOC  is not extensively studied yet. Virus-neutralizing activity  VNA  of sera obtained from people vaccinated with Sputnik V in relation to internationally relevant genetic lineages B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2  B.1.617.3 and Moscow endemic variants B.1.1.141  T385I  and B.1.1.317  S477N  A522S  with mutations in the RBD domain has been assessed. The data obtained indicate no significant differences in VNA against B.1.1.7  B.1.617.3 and local genetic lineages B.1.1.141  T385I   B.1.1.317  S477N  A522S  with RBD mutations. For the B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617.2 statistically significant 3.1-  2.8-  and 2.5-fold  respectively  VNA reduction was observed. Notably  this decrease is lower than that reported in publications for other vaccines. However  a direct comparative study is necessary for a conclusion. Thus  sera from “Sputnik V”-vaccinated retain neutralizing activity against VOC B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2  B.1.617.3 as well as local genetic lineages B.1.1.141 and B.1.1.317 circulating in Moscow.

The accumulation of these mutations could be the consequence of intrahost viral evolution due to prolonged infection in immunocompromised hosts. In this study  we document the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential tracheal aspirates from an immunosuppressed patient on steroids and convalescent plasma therapy and identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the first swab  day 0  and from three tracheal aspirates  days 7  21  and 27  were compared at the sequence level. We identified a mixed viral population with five different S protein mutations  141 to 144 deletion  243 to 244 deletion  E484K  Q493K  and Q493R  at the NTD or RBD region from the second tracheal aspirate sample  day 21  and a predominance of the S protein 141 to 144 LGVY deletion and E484K mutant on day 27. The neutralizing antibodies against various S protein lentiviral pseudovirus mutants  as well as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig and IgG  showed “U” shape dynamics  in support of the endogenous development of neutralizing antibodies. The patient’s compromised immune status  the antirejection regiment  convalescent plasma treatment  and the development of neutralizing antibodies may have resulted in unique selective pressures on the intrahost genomic evolution  and this observation supports the hypotheses that VOCs can independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for immune escape mutants. IMPORTANCE Over a year of the COVID-19 pandemic  distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  lineages have arisen in multiple geographic areas around the world. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs   i.e.  B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma   and B.1.617.2  delta   harboring mutations and or deletions in spike protein N-terminal domain  NTD  or receptor-binding domain  RBD  regions showed evidence of increased transmissibility and disease severity and possible reduced vaccine efficacy. In this study  we report the emergence of five different NTD and RBD mutations in an uncommon SARS-CoV-2 B.1.369 lineage from an immunosuppressed patient undergoing steroid and convalescent plasma therapy. The observation highlighted that VOCs can independently arise in immunocompromised populations undergoing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy  and enhanced measures will be required to reduce the transmission.

Data regarding the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in Gauteng before the fourth wave of coronavirus disease 2019  Covid-19   in which the omicron variant was dominant  are needed. METHODS: We conducted a seroepidemiologic survey from October 22 to December 9  2021  in Gauteng to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Households included in a previous seroepidemiologic survey  conducted from November 2020 to January 2021  were contacted; to account for changes in the survey population  there was a 10% increase in the households contacted  with the use of the same sampling framework. Dried-blood-spot samples were tested for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein with the use of quantitative assays. We also evaluated Covid-19 epidemiologic trends in Gauteng  including cases  hospitalizations  recorded deaths  and excess deaths from the start of the pandemic through January 12  2022. RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 7010 participants  of whom 1319  18.8%  had received a Covid-19 vaccine. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG ranged from 56.2%  95% confidence interval [CI]  52.6 to 59.7  among children younger than 12 years of age to 79.7%  95% CI  77.6 to 81.5  among adults older than 50 years of age. Vaccinated participants were more likely to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 than unvaccinated participants  93.1% vs. 68.4% . Epidemiologic data showed that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased and subsequently declined more rapidly during the fourth wave than it had during the three previous waves. The incidence of infection was decoupled from the incidences of hospitalization  recorded death  and excess death during the fourth wave  as compared with the proportions seen during previous waves. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread underlying SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was observed in Gauteng before the omicron-dominant wave of Covid-19. Epidemiologic data showed a decoupling of hospitalizations and deaths from infections while omicron was circulating.  Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Here we use the dense genomic surveillance data generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 71 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and June 2021. This analysis reveals a series of subepidemics that peaked in early autumn 2020  followed by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 Alpha lineage. The Alpha variant grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown suppressed the Alpha variant and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. Yet a series of variants  most of which contained the spike E484K mutation  defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. However  by accounting for sustained introductions  we found that the transmissibility of these variants is unlikely to have exceeded the transmissibility of the Alpha variant. Finally  B.1.617.2 Delta was repeatedly introduced in England and grew rapidly in early summer 2021  constituting approximately 98% of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 26 June 2021.

Since July 2021  SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have increased rapidly in this region. As infection rates rise due to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  current preventive strategies such as mask wearing and social distancing have controlled its spread effectively. Prolonged school closure is currently being promoted to suppress virus spread among children. However  the negative impact of prolonged school closure is significant. Although vaccination of children under 12 is still controversial  preparations must be made now for their vaccination.

Vaccination rates  single dose  in England are lower among children aged 16–17 years and 12–15 years  whose vaccination in England commenced in August and September  2021  respectively. We aimed to analyse the underlying dynamics driving patterns in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during September  2021  in England. METHODS: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1  REACT-1  study  which commenced data collection in May  2020  involves a series of random cross-sectional surveys in the general population of England aged 5 years and older. Using RT-PCR swab positivity data from 100 527 participants with valid throat and nose swabs in round 14 of REACT-1  Sept 9–27  2021   we estimated community-based prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine effectiveness against infection by combining round 14 data with data from round 13  June 24 to July 12  2021; n=172 862 . FINDINGS: During September  2021  we estimated a mean RT-PCR positivity rate of 0·83%  95% CrI 0·76–0·89   with a reproduction number  R  overall of 1·03  95% CrI 0·94–1·14 . Among the 475  62·2%  of 764 sequenced positive swabs  all were of the delta variant; 22  4·63%; 95% CI 3·07–6·91  included the Tyr145His mutation in the spike protein associated with the AY.4 sublineage  and there was one Glu484Lys mutation. Age  region  key worker status  and household size jointly contributed to the risk of swab positivity. The highest weighted prevalence was observed among children aged 5–12 years  at 2·32%  95% CrI 1·96–2·73  and those aged 13–17 years  at 2·55%  2·11–3·08 . The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic grew in those aged 5–11 years  with an R of 1·42  95% CrI 1·18–1·68   but declined in those aged 18–54 years  with an R of 0·81  0·68–0·97 . At ages 18–64 years  the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection was 62·8%  95% CI 49·3–72·7  after two doses compared to unvaccinated people  for all vaccines combined  44·8%  22·5–60·7  for the ChAdOx1 nCov-19  Oxford–AstraZeneca  vaccine  and 71·3%  56·6–81·0  for the BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech  vaccine. In individuals aged 18 years and older  the weighted prevalence of swab positivity was 0·35%  95% CrI 0·31–0·40  if the second dose was administered up to 3 months before their swab but 0·55%  0·50–0·61  for those who received their second dose 3–6 months before their swab  compared to 1·76%  1·60–1·95  among unvaccinated individuals. INTERPRETATION: In September  2021  at the start of the autumn school term in England  infections were increasing exponentially in children aged 5–17 years  at a time when vaccination rates were low in this age group. In adults  compared to those who received their second dose less than 3 months ago  the higher prevalence of swab positivity at 3–6 months following two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine suggests an increased risk of breakthrough infections during this period.

The variant of concern  VOC  Alpha was first identified in September 2020 in the United Kingdom  and rapidly became dominant across Europe. Our objective was to elucidate the Alpha VOC outcompetition rate and identify mutations in the spike glycoprotein  S  gene  indicative of the circulation of the Alpha VOC and or other variants in the population through wastewater analysis. In the period covered by this study  November 2020–April 2021   forteen wastewater treatment plants  WWTPs  were weekly sampled. The total number of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per L  GC L  was determined with a Real-Time qPCR  targeting the N gene. Surveillance of the Alpha VOC circulation was ascertained using a duplex RT-qPCR  targeting and discriminating the S gene. Our results showed that in a period of 6 weeks the Alpha VOC was present in all the studied WWTPs  and became dominant in 11 weeks on average. The outcompetition rates of the Alpha VOC were estimated  and their relationship with different parameters statistically analyzed. The rapid spread of the Alpha VOC was influenced by its initial input and by the previous circulation of SARS-COV-2 in the population. This latter point could be explained by its higher transmissibility  particularly advantadgeous when a certain degree of herd immunity exists. Moreover  the presence of signature mutations of SARS-COV-2 variants were established by deep-sequencing of the complete S gene. The circulation of the Alpha VOC in the area under study was confirmed  and additionally two combinations of mutations in the S glycoprotein  T73A and D253N  and S477N and A522S  that could affect antibody binding were identified.

High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work  we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here  the pseudotyped particles  PP  contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus  MLV  gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface  resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles  and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells  resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5 158 approved drugs and drug candidates  our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven  six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally  particles pseudotyped with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.

Here we tested the neutralizing activity of infected and or vaccinated individuals against pseudoviruses expressing the spike of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1  WH1   the D614G mutant and the B.1.1.7 variant. Our data show that parameters of natural infection  time from infection and nature of the infecting variant  determined cross-neutralization. Uninfected vaccinees showed a small reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant compared to both the WH1 strain and the D614G mutant. Interestingly  upon vaccination  previously infected individuals developed more robust neutralizing responses against B.1.1.7  suggesting that vaccines can boost the neutralization breadth conferred by natural infection.

We present a 2.9-Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy  cryo-EM  structure of the complex between the ACE2 receptor and N501Y spike protein ectodomains that shows Y501 inserted into a cavity at the binding interface near Y41 of ACE2. This additional interaction provides a structural explanation for the increased ACE2 affinity of the N501Y mutant  and likely contributes to its increased infectivity. However  this mutation does not result in large structural changes  enabling important neutralization epitopes to be retained in the spike receptor binding domain. We confirmed this through biophysical assays and by determining cryo-EM structures of spike protein ectodomains bound to 2 representative potent neutralizing antibody fragments.

Syrian  Mesocricetus auratus  and dwarf  Phodopus sp.  hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory setting. However  pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreaks have not been reported. METHODS: We conducted an investigation of a pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreak due to Delta variant AY.127 involving at least three patients in Hong Kong. We tested samples collected from the patients  environment  and hamsters linked to this outbreak and performed whole genome sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR-positive samples. RESULTS: The patients included a pet shop keeper  Patient 1   a female customer of the pet shop  Patient 2   and the husband of Patient 2  Patient 3 . Investigation showed that 17.2%  5 29  and 25.5%  13 51  environmental specimens collected from the pet shop and its related warehouse  respectively  tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Among euthanized hamsters randomly collected from the storehouse  3%  3 100  tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR and seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody by ELISA. Whole genome analysis showed that although all genomes from the outbreak belonged to the Delta variant AY.127  there were at least 3 nucleotide differences among the genomes from different patients and the hamster cages. Genomic analysis suggests that multiple strains have emerged within the hamster population  and these different strains have likely transmitted to human either via direct contact or via the environment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated probable hamster-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As pet trading is common around the world  this can represent a route of international spread of this pandemic virus.

With the continuous evolution of the viral genome  SARS-CoV-2 has evolved many variants. B.1.617.2  also called Delta  is one of the most concerned variants. The Delta variant was first reported in India at the end of 2020 but has spread globally  by now  to 135 countries and is not stand still. Delta shared some mutations with other variants  and owned its special mutations on spike proteins  which may be responsible for its strong transmission and increasing virulence. Under these circumstances  a systematic summary of Delta is necessary. This review will focus on the Delta variant. We will describe all the characteristics of Delta  including biological features and clinical characteristics   analyze potential reasons for its strong transmission  and provide potential protective ways for combating Delta.

As of December 2021  the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for adolescents aged 16-17 years and under FDA emergency use authorization for those aged 12-15 years. In a prospective cohort in Arizona  243 adolescents aged 12-17 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  each week  irrespective of symptoms  and upon onset of COVID-19-like illness during July 25-December 4  2021; the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant was the predominant strain during this study period. During the study  190 adolescents contributed fully vaccinated person-time  ≥14 days after receiving 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine   30 contributed partially vaccinated person-time  receipt of 1 dose or receipt of 2 doses but with the second dose completed <14 days earlier   and 66 contributed unvaccinated person-time. Using the Cox proportional-hazards model  the estimated VE of full Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92%  95% CI = 79%-97%   adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics  health information  frequency of social contact  mask use  location  and local virus circulation. These findings from a real-world setting indicate that 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among Arizona adolescents. CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible persons in the United States  including persons aged 12-17 years.

Currently available monoclonal antibodies and vaccines appear to have reduced efficacy against some of these VoCs. Antivirals targeting conserved proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to be affected by mutations arising in VoCs and should therefore be effective against emerging variants. We here investigate the efficacy of molnupiravir  currently in phase 2 clinical trials  in hamsters infected with Wuhan strain or B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Molnupiravir proved to be effective against infections with each of the variants and therefore may have potential combating current and future emerging VoCs.

METHODS: Epidemiological analysis  environmental samplings  and whole genome sequencing  WGS  were performed for a hospital outbreak. RESULTS: A superspreading event involving 12 patients and 9 healthcare workers  HCWs  occurred within 4 days in 3 of 6 cubicles at an old-fashioned general ward with no air exhaust built within the cubicles. The environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly higher in air grilles  >2m from patients’ head and not reachable by hands  than high-touch clinical surfaces  36.4%  8 22 vs 3.4%  1 29  p=0.003 . Six  66.7%  of 9 contaminated air exhaust grilles were located outside patient cubicle. The clinical attack rate of patients was significantly higher than HCWs  15.4%  12 78 exposed-patients vs 4.6%  9 195 exposed-HCWs  p=0.005 . Moreover  clinical attack rate of ward-based HCWs was significantly higher than non-ward-based HCWs  8.1%  7 68 vs 1.8%  2 109  p=0.045 . The episodes  mean ± S.D  of patient-care duty assignment in the cubicles was significantly higher among infected ward-based HCWs than non-infected ward-based HCWs  6.0±2.4 vs 3.0±2.9  p=0.012  during the outbreak period. The outbreak strains belong to SARS-CoV-2 lineage  B.1.36.27  GISAID Clade GH  with the unique S-T470N mutation on WGS. CONCLUSION: This nosocomial point source superspreading due to possible airborne transmission demonstrated the need for stringent SARS-CoV-2 screening at admission to healthcare facilities and better architectural design of the ventilation system to prevent such outbreaks. Portable high-efficiency particulate filters were installed in each cubicle to improve ventilation before resumption of clinical service.

The emergence and spread of the B.1.617.2 Delta variant considered to be driving the devastating second wave of COVID-19 in India. Currently  the Delta variant has rapidly overtaken the previously circulating variants to become the dominant strain. Critical mutations in the spike RBD region of these variants have raised serious concerns about the virus's increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine effectiveness. As a result  significant scientific and public concern has been expressed about the impact of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to provide an additional explanation in the context of the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants in India  the vaccine-induced immune response to the variants of concern  VOC   and various vaccine deployment strategies to rapidly increase population immunity. CONTENT: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in India suggests the emergence and spread of B.1.617 variant. The immunogenicity of currently approved vaccines indicates that the majority of vaccines elicit an antibody response and some level of protection. According to current data  vaccines in the pre-fusion configuration  2p substitution  have an advantage in terms of nAb titer  but the duration of vaccine-induced immunity  as well as the role of T cells and memory B cells in protection  remain unknown. Since vaccine efficacy on virus variants is one of the major factors to be considered for achieving herd immunity  existing vaccines need to be improved or effective next-generation vaccines should be developed to cover the new variants of the virus.

Schools are opening for in-person learning  and many prekindergarten children are returning to early care and education programs during a time when the number of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  is increasing.§ Therefore  it is important to monitor indicators of severe COVID-19 among children and adolescents. This analysis uses Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network  COVID-NET ¶ data to describe COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among U.S. children and adolescents aged 0-17 years. During March 1  2020-August 14  2021  the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 49.7 per 100 000 children and adolescents. The weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate per 100 000 children and adolescents during the week ending August 14  2021  1.4  was nearly five times the rate during the week ending June 26  2021  0.3 ; among children aged 0-4 years  the weekly hospitalization rate during the week ending August 14  2021  was nearly 10 times that during the week ending June 26  2021.** During June 20-July 31  2021  the hospitalization rate among unvaccinated adolescents  aged 12-17 years  was 10.1 times higher than that among fully vaccinated adolescents. Among all hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19  the proportions with indicators of severe disease  such as intensive care unit [ICU] admission  after the Delta variant became predominant  June 20-July 31  2021  were similar to those earlier in the pandemic  March 1  2020-June 19  2021 .

Simultaneously  several other VOCs were identified globally. Unlike B.1.1.7  some of these VOCs possess mutations thought to confer partial immune escape. Understanding when and how these additional VOCs pose a threat in settings where B.1.1.7 is currently dominant is vital. METHODS: We examine trends in the prevalence of non-B.1.1.7 lineages in London and other English regions using passive-case detection PCR data  cross-sectional community infection surveys  genomic surveillance  and wastewater monitoring. The study period spans from 31st January 2021 to 15th May 2021. FINDINGS: Across data sources  the percentage of non-B.1.1.7 variants has been increasing since late March 2021. This increase was initially driven by a variety of lineages with immune escape. From mid-April  B.1.617.2  WHO label Delta  spread rapidly  becoming the dominant variant in England by late May. INTERPRETATION: The outcome of competition between variants depends on a wide range of factors such as intrinsic transmissibility  evasion of prior immunity  demographic specificities and interactions with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The presence and rise of non-B.1.1.7 variants in March likely was driven by importations and some community transmission. There was competition between non-B.1.17 variants which resulted in B.1.617.2 becoming dominant in April and May with considerable community transmission. Our results underscore that early detection of new variants requires a diverse array of data sources in community surveillance.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  cycle threshold  Ct  values in specimens from 127 vaccinated persons with breakthrough cases were similar to those from 84 persons who were unvaccinated  not fully vaccinated  or whose vaccination status was unknown  median = 22.77 and 21.54  respectively . The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible  1 ; vaccination is the most important strategy to prevent severe illness and death. On July 27  CDC recommended that all persons  including those who are fully vaccinated  should wear masks in indoor public settings in areas where COVID-19 transmission is high or substantial.* Findings from this investigation suggest that even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies  including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status  given the potential risk of infection during attendance at large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of transmission.

Named B.1.427 B.1.429 to denote its 2 lineages  the variant emerged in May 2020 and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from September 2020 to January 2021  showing 18.6-24% increased transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains. The variant carries 3 mutations in the spike protein  including an L452R substitution. We found 2-fold increased B.1.427 B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and increased L452R pseudovirus infection of cell cultures and lung organoids  albeit decreased relative to pseudoviruses carrying the N501Y mutation common to variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. Antibody neutralization assays revealed 4.0 to 6.7-fold and 2.0-fold decreases in neutralizing titers from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients  respectively. The increased prevalence of a more transmissible variant in California exhibiting decreased antibody neutralization warrants further investigation.

Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.1.7  alpha  and lineage A  in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated  which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance  only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup  aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8  N = 4 for each variant  sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour  highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly  the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined  this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.

Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss  and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1 2020  Alpha  Beta  or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast  infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss  even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1 2020 infection. Conclusions These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants. Funding Funding for this study was provided by NIH grant CA260476  the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness  the Ragon Institute  and the Musk Foundation.

Cellular immune responses  particularly CD8 +  T cell responses  probably contribute to protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection 2–6 . Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein. Individuals who received the Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable spike-specific CD8 +  and CD4 +  T cell responses  which showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and the Omicron variants  including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron spike-specific CD8 +  T cell responses were 82–84% of the WA1 2020 spike-specific CD8 +  T cell responses. These data provide immunological context for the observation that current vaccines still show robust protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantially reduced neutralizing antibody responses 7 8 .

Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies  including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However  newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis  Johnson & Johnson  and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies  including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines  increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses  and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants  have been suggested. AREAS COVERED: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. EXPERT OPINION: Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants. We analyzed the effects of reported variants on neutralizing antibodies and the protective efficacy of different vaccines and propose strategies for applying current vaccines against variants and developing next-generation vaccines.

Although the advent of the first vaccines has significantly reduced these rates  data on older adults in clinical trials are scarce. OBJECTIVES: We quantified and compared the humoral response in individuals with vs. without pre-existing seropositivity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   in a cohort of 69 patients living in a nursing home and who had received the recommended two doses of the Comirnaty  Pfizer-BioNTech®  vaccine. RESULTS: All 69 patients  100%  tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 2 months post-vaccination. Residents with a pre-vaccination infection had significantly higher titers of anti-spike 1 IgG than those with no prior infection  median [interquartile range]: 55 726 [14463–78852] vs. 1314 [272–1249] arbitrary units  respectively; p < 0.001 . The same result was observed for neutralizing antibodies titers  704 [320–1280] vs. 47 [20–40] respectively; p < 0.001 . Between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods  for IgG and neutralizing antibodies  we observed a 49 and 8-fold increase respectively. In comparison to the wild-type Receptor Binding Domain  RBD   the binding capacity of these vaccine sera was significantly decreased on the B.1.351 and P.1 variants RBD but not decreased with respect to the B.1.1.7 RBD. Although all nursing home residents developed a humoral response following Comirnaty vaccine  its intensity appeared to depend on the pre-vaccination serological status. CONCLUSION: Our results raise the question of how many doses of vaccine should be administered in older and how long the protection will be effective.

However  the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and  in some cases  escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here  we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate  with B.1.1.7-vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus. P.1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers. However  all antigens protected from challenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

In vitro  B.1.617.2 is sixfold less sensitive to serum neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals  and eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies  compared with wild-type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralizing titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx1 vaccinees than in BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies to the receptor-binding domain and the amino-terminal domain. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency than B.1.1.7 in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems  associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared with B.1.1.7 spike. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate highly efficient syncytium formation that was less sensitive to inhibition by neutralizing antibody  compared with that of wild-type spike. We also observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike-mediated entry than B.1.617.1  potentially explaining the B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of more than 130 SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation  we observed reduced ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2  with the caveat of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine efficacy against the highly fit and immune-evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   a key protein for the viral entry into the host cells. Here  we report an efficient computational approach  including the simple energy minimizations and binding free energy calculations  starting from an experimental structure of the binding complex along with experimental calibration of the calculated binding free energies  to rapidly and reliably predict the binding affinities of the N501Y mutant with human ACE2  hACE2  and recently reported miniprotein and hACE2 decoy  CTC-445.2  drug candidates. It has been demonstrated that the N501Y mutation markedly increases the ACE2-spike protein binding affinity  K d   from 22 to 0.44 nM  which could partially explain why the UK variant is more infectious. The miniproteins are predicted to have ∼10 000- to 100 000-fold diminished binding affinities with the N501Y mutant  creating a need for design of novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the N501Y mutation-induced drug resistance. The N501Y mutation is also predicted to decrease the binding affinity of a hACE2 decoy  CTC-445.2  binding with the spike protein by ∼200-fold. This convenient computational approach along with experimental calibration may be similarly used in the future to predict the binding affinities of potential new variants of the spike protein.

It has further created a socio-economic chaos throughout Latin America. Currently  some new SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating in Latin America and one among the significant variant belongs to the P.1 lineage  B.1.1.28.1  that has 17 mutations. The essential modifications located in the spike glycoprotein RBD include E484K  K417T and N501Y. Along with the P.1 lineage  P.2 lineage  B.1.1.28.2  has also appeared recently. Details on all the variants are unknown  along with the Brazil variants at this time. Therefore  we call for intensive research to collect more data to understand the variants' virulence and the effects on vaccine efficacy.

The conformational variability of the mutation sites for B.1.617.2  Δ   B.1.617.1  κ   B.1.427 429  ε   P.1  γ   B.1.351  β   B.1.1.7  α   S477N  and the wild-type strain has been assessed using a deep neural-network-based prediction program of conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins  SSSCPreds . We find that although the conformation of G614 is rigid  which is assigned as a left-handed  LH  α-helix-type one  that of D614 is flexible without the hydrogen bonding latch to T859. The rigidity of glycine  which stabilizes the local conformation more effectively than that of aspartic acid with the latch  thereby contributes to the reduction of S1 shedding  high expression  and increase in infectivity. The finding that the sequence flexibility rigidity map pattern of B.1.1.7 is similar to that of the wild-type strain but is largely different from those of B.1.351 and P.1 correlates with the minor escape ability of B.1.1.7. The increased rigidity of the amino acid sequence YRYRLFR from the SSSCPreds data of B.1.427 429 near the L452R mutation site contributes to the 2-fold increased B.1.427 B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and the increase in transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains in a similar manner to D614G. The concordance and rigidity ratios of multiple mutation strains such as B.1.617.2 against the wild-type one at the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and receptor-binding motif  RBM  regions provide a good indication of the transmissibility and neutralization escape ability except for binding affinity of mutation sites such as N501Y.

Affinity selection–mass spectrometry was used for the discovery of botanical ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Cannabinoid acids from hemp  Cannabis sativa  were found to be allosteric as well as orthosteric ligands with micromolar affinity for the spike protein. In follow-up virus neutralization assays  cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid prevented infection of human epithelial cells by a pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevented entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Importantly  cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid were equally effective against the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant B.1.1.7 and the beta variant B.1.351. Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use  these cannabinoids  isolated or in hemp extracts  have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Here  we describe the durability and broad-spectrum VOC immunity of a prefusion-stabilized spike  S  protein adjuvanted with liquid or lyophilized CoVaccine HT in cynomolgus macaques. This recombinant subunit vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces robust spike-specific and broadly neutralizing antibody responses effective against circulating VOCs  B.1.351 [Beta]  P.1 [Gamma]  and B.1.617 [Delta]  for at least three months after the final boost. Protective efficacy and postexposure immunity were evaluated using a heterologous P.1 challenge nearly three months after the last immunization. Our results indicate that while immunization with both high and low S doses shorten and reduce viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract  a higher antigen dose is required to provide durable protection against disease as vaccine immunity wanes. Histologically  P.1 infection causes similar COVID-19-like lung pathology as seen with early pandemic isolates. Postchallenge IgG concentrations were restored to peak immunity levels  and vaccine-matched and cross-variant neutralizing antibodies were significantly elevated in immunized macaques indicating an efficient anamnestic response. Only low levels of P.1-specific neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth were observed in control  nonvaccinated but challenged  macaques  suggesting that natural infection may not prevent reinfection by other VOCs. Overall  these results demonstrate that a properly dosed and adjuvanted recombinant subunit vaccine can provide protective immunity against circulating VOCs for at least three months.

Assay optimization and testing was performed with RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1 2020  wild type [WT]   B.1.1.7  and B.1.351 variant strains. The assay was then validated using clinical samples. The limit of detection for both the WT and variants was 4 and 10 genomic copies reaction for the 501- and 484-codon assays  respectively. The assay was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying the N501Y and E484K mutations in cultured virus and in clinical samples  as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We have developed an RT-PCR melt screening test for the major VOCs that can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples  providing an early warning for the emergence of these variants and a simple way to track their spread.

Through the pre-clinical chain of experiments: enzymatic  molecular docking  cell-based and in vivo assays  it is demonstrated here that both SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage and variant of concern gamma are susceptible to this antiretroviral. Enzymatic assays and molecular docking calculations showed that SARS-CoV-2 main protease  M pro   was inhibited by ATV  with Morrison’s inhibitory constant  K i   1.5-fold higher than GC376  a positive control  dependent of the catalytic water  H 2 O cat   content. ATV was a competitive inhibitor  increasing the M pro ’s Michaelis–Menten  K m   more than sixfold. Cell-based assays indicated that different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ATV. Using oral administration of ATV in mice to reach plasmatic exposure similar to humans  transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin converting enzyme 2  K18-hACE2  were partially protected against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 gamma. Moreover  less cell death and inflammation were observed in the lung from infected and treated mice. Our studies may contribute to a better comprehension of the M pro  ATV interaction  which could pave the way to the development of specific inhibitors of this viral protease.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance was performed on respiratory samples from 231 unique patients  collected at a single large health system in Southern California between November 2020 and March 2021 during the winter surge. RESULTS: The frequencies of the Epsilon variant among outpatients  hospitalized patients  and ICU patients were indifferent. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the Epsilon variant is not associated with increased hospitalization and ICU admission.

METHODS: This is a descriptive case series reporting SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant infections in a group of dogs and cats with suspected myocarditis. RESULTS: The study describes the infection of domestic cats and dogs by the B.1.1.7 variant. Two cats and one dog were positive to SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR on rectal swab  and two cats and one dog were found to have SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies 2–6 weeks after they developed signs of cardiac disease. Many owners of these pets had developed respiratory symptoms 3–6 weeks before their pets became ill and had also tested positive for COVID‐19. Interestingly  all these pets were referred for acute onset of cardiac disease  including severe myocardial disorders of suspected inflammatory origin but without primary respiratory signs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate  for the first time  the ability for pets to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant and question its possible pathogenicity in these animals.

The question remains if there are other more infectious variants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of 506 768 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike  S  protein receptor-binding domain  RBD . We reveal that essentially all 100 most observed mutations strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular  we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K  S477N  S477R  and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom  UK   South Africa  and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies  while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants  L452R and E484Q found in India variants  can potentially disrupt the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies. Among these RBD mutations  L452R is also now known as part of the California variant B.1.427. Finally  we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies  called vaccine escape mutations  will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given  including S494P  Q493L  K417N  F490S  F486L  R403K  E484K  L452R  K417T  F490L  E484Q  and A475S. Mutation T478K appears to make the Mexico variant B.1.1.222 the most infectious one. Our comprehensive genetic analysis and protein-protein binding study show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on the RBD  which may be regulated by host gene editing  viral proofreading  random genetic drift  and natural selection  gives rise to more infectious variants that will potentially compromise existing vaccines and antibody therapies.

Moreover  surgical safety is a critical topic that deserves to be addressed thoroughly during medical education  as part of the broader topic of patient safety. To maximize students’ engagement and to enhance their interest in patient safety and healthcare quality  it is imperative to explore and innovate stirring and interactive methods of learning. Through this paper  we present a unique narrative novel story-based  peer-led surgical safety teaching session organized by medical student representatives of Middle East's first student-led patient safety initiative and attended by medical students from various academic years. Methods A 1-hour case-based interactive learning session on surgical safety was developed  based on the World Health Organization  WHO  patient safety curriculum for medical schools. The session was peer-led at Alfaisal University College of Medicine  Riyadh and participation was voluntary. Learning objectives included surgical safety checklist  human factors  complexity of healthcare  students’ critical role in safety and open disclosure. The session included a verbal “story-telling” segment  followed by a didactic segment where learning objectives were covered. Attendees were continuously engaged throughout the session with the help of verbal inquiries. Pre-test and post-test questionnaires were distributed to assess participants' knowledge  awareness and perceptions regarding surgical safety and other objectives covered in the session. Results A total of 75 students participated in the session  consisting of 57.3% females and 42.7% males. Responses to the pre-test and post-test were analyzed and compared. Most students who attended the session reported that it was of value to them - with more than 90% of students considering the session either valuable or highly valuable. After the session  more students  10.67%  p = 0.10  were correctly able to identify that the initial reaction in healthcare is often individual blame  Q.1 . Additionally  more students  30.63%  p < 0.001  were able to correctly identify the implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist as the major factor that has contributed to the reduction of errors in healthcare  Q.2 . Students’ responses also indicated that after attending the session a higher number  16%  p = 0.01  correctly identified that most errors linked to surgery were potentially preventable  Q.3 . Conclusion Students are inherently willing to learn and engage in interactive learning. It was encouraging to see medical students show interest in this important patient safety topic  which also encourages similar future peer-learning initiatives. As reported  narrative story-based peer-assisted learning is an effective way to engage medical students in the cause of patient safety and should be utilized to further their knowledge and awareness regarding critical healthcare safety areas such as surgical safety  medication safety and infection control and instill a sense of responsibility in these future physicians.

SARS-CoV-2 variants assessment should be easily  rapidly  and routinely available in any academic hospital. Materials and Methods: SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing was performed retrospectively in a single laboratory  LPCE  Louis Pasteur Hospital  Nice  France  in 103 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. An automated workflow used the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2 panel on the Genexus Sequencer. The analyses were made from nasopharyngeal swab  NSP   n = 64  and or saliva  n = 39  samples. All samples were collected in the metropolitan area of the Nice city  France  from September 2020 to March 2021. Results: The mean turnaround time between RNA extraction and result reports was 30 h for each run of 15 samples. A strong correlation was noted for the results obtained between NSP and saliva paired samples  regardless of low viral load and high  >28  Ct values. After repeated sequencing runs  complete failure of obtaining a valid sequencing result was observed in 4% of samples. Besides the European strain  B.1.160   various variants were identified  including one variant of concern  B.1.1.7   and different variants under monitoring. Discussion: Our data highlight the current feasibility of developing the SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing approach in a single hospital center. Moreover  these data showed that using the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2 Assay  the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is rapid and efficient not only in NSP but also in saliva samples with a low viral load. The advantages and limitations of this setup are discussed.

It has been noted in vitro that upon exposure to these treatments  mutations could be selected. CASE PRESENTATION: We here report the case of an immunosuppressed patient infected with a B.1.1.7 variant  who received a combination of monoclonal antibodies  and subsequently selected mutations K417N  E484K and Q493R on Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises the importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 mutations in patients receiving monoclonal antibodies and having persistent excretion of the virus  in order to offer optimal management of their infection  and strengthen prevention measures to avoid subsequent transmission of these selected variants.

Here  we compare the neutralization of variants of concern  including B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.1.529  Omicron  in sera from individuals exposed to variant infection  vaccination  or both. We demonstrate that neutralizing antibody responses are strongest against variants sharing certain spike mutations with the immunizing exposure. We also observe that exposure to multiple spike variants increases the breadth of variant cross-neutralization. These findings contribute to understanding relationships between exposures and antibody responses and may inform booster vaccination strategies.

We report 322 full SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 39 424 reported SARS-CoV-2 infections  thus representing 0.8% of the reported cases. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences revealed the emergence of lineage A.23.1 from lineage A.23. Lineage A.23.1 represented 88% of the genomes observed in December 2020  then 100% of the genomes observed in January 2021. The A.23.1 lineage was also reported in 26 other countries. Although the precise changes in A.23.1 differ from those reported in the first three SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs   the A.23.1 spike-protein-coding region has changes similar to VOCs including a change at position 613  a change in the furin cleavage site that extends the basic amino acid motif and multiple changes in the immunogenic N-terminal domain. In addition  the A.23.1 lineage has changes in non-spike proteins including nsp6  ORF8 and ORF9 that are also altered in other VOCs. The clinical impact of the A.23.1 variant is not yet clear and it has not been designated as a VOC. However  our findings of emergence and spread of this variant indicate that careful monitoring of this variant  together with assessment of the consequences of the spike protein changes for COVID-19 vaccine performance  are advisable.

Recently reported mutations in the spike glycoprotein unique to the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of different variants might increase the binding and pathogenesis. However  it is still not known how these mutations affect the binding of RBD to GRP78. The current study provides a structural basis for the binding of GRP78 to the different variants  i.e.  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617  and P.1  spike RBD   of SARS-CoV-2 using a biomolecular simulation approach. Docking results showed that the new variants bound stronger than the wild-type  which was further confirmed through the free energy calculation results. All-atom simulation confirmed structural stability  which was consistent with previous results by following the global stability trend. We concluded that the increased binding affinity of the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variants was due to a variation in the bonding network that helped the virus induce a higher infectivity and disease severity. Consequently  we reported that the aforementioned new variants use GRP78 as an alternate receptor to enhance their seriousness.

Here  by examining patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations that have accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 genomes since the pandemic began  we find that the emergence of these three “501Y lineages” coincided with a major global shift in the selective forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes. Following their emergence  the adaptive evolution of 501Y lineage viruses has involved repeated selectively favoured convergent mutations at 35 genome sites: mutations we refer to as the 501Y meta-signature. The ongoing convergence of viruses in many other lineages on this meta-signature suggests that it includes multiple mutation combinations capable of promoting the persistence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the face of mounting host immune recognition.
doi:10.1128/spectrum.02513-21,Emergency SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern: Novel Multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR Assay for Rapid Detection and Surveillance,doi:10.1128/spectrum.02513-21,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02513-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35196812/,pubmed:35196812,pmc:PMC8865422,Microbiol Spectr,2022,Emergency SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern: Novel Multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR Assay for Rapid Detection and Surveillance,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has spread worldwide. Many variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported  some of which have increased transmissibility and or reduced susceptibility to vaccines. There is an urgent need for variant phenotyping for epidemiological surveillance of circulating lineages. Whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants  which constitutes a major bottleneck in developing countries. Methodological simplification could increase epidemiological surveillance feasibility and efficiency. We designed a novel multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR  RT-PCR  to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants with S gene mutations. This multiplex PCR typing method was established to detect 9 mutations with specific primers and probes  ΔHV 69 70  K417T  K417N  L452R  E484K  E484Q  N501Y  P681H  and P681R  against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In silico analyses showed high specificity of the assays. Variants of concern  VOC  typing results were found to be highly specific for our intended targets  with no cross-reactivity observed with other upper respiratory viruses. The PCR-based typing methods were further validated using whole-genome sequencing and a commercial kit that was applied to clinical samples of 250 COVID-19 patients from Taiwan. The screening of these samples allowed the identification of epidemic trends by time intervals  including B.1.617.2 in the third Taiwan wave outbreak. This PCR typing strategy allowed the detection of five major variants of concern and also provided an open-source PCR assay which could rapidly be deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence and spread of B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617.2 variants and of four Omicron mutations on the spike protein  ΔHV 69 70  K417N  N501Y  P681H . IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has spread globally. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs  are leading the next waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have pointed out that these VOCs may have increased infectivity  have reduced vaccine susceptibility  change treatment regimens  and increase the difficulty of epidemic prevention policy. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 variants remains an issue of concern for all local government authorities and is critical for establishing and implementing effective public health measures. A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant identification method based on a multiplex real-time RT-PCR was developed in this study. Five SARS-CoV-2 variants  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta  and Omicron  were identified simultaneously using this method. PCR typing can provide rapid testing results with lower cost and higher feasibility  which is well within the capacity for any diagnostic laboratory. Characterizing these variants and their mutations is important for tracking SAR-CoV-2 evolution and is conducive to public infection control and policy formulation strategies.

In this study  we demonstrate that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant  TY8-612 strain  induces bodyweight loss and inflammatory cytokine chemokine production in wild-type laboratory mice  BALB c and C57BL 6 J mice . Furthermore  compared to their counterparts  BALB c mice had a higher viral load in their lungs and worse symptoms. Importantly  infecting aged BALB c mice  older than 6 months  with the TY8-612 strain elicited a massive and sustained production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines chemokines and led to universal mortality. These results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant-infected mice exhibited symptoms ranging from mild to fatal depending on their strain and age.

To overcome this problem  we have developed a clustered  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  CRISPR  loop mediated amplification  LAMP  technology to detect influenza A virus  influenza B virus  respiratory syncytial A virus  respiratory syncytial B virus  and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  including variants of concern  B.1.1.7   which utilized CRISPR-associated protein 12a  Cas12a  to advance LAMP technology with the sensitivity increased 10 times. To reduce aerosol contamination in CRISPR-LAMP technology  an uracil-DNA-glycosylase-reverse transcription-LAMP system was also developed which can effectively remove dUTP-incorporated LAMP amplicons. In vitro Cas12a cleavage reaction with 28 crRNAs showed that there were no position constraints for Cas12a CRISPR RNA  crRNA  recognition and cleavage in LAMP amplicons  and even the looped position of LAMP amplicons could be effectively recognized and cleaved. Wild-type or spike N501Y can be detected with a limit of detection of 10 copies μL  wild-type  even at a 1% ratio level on the background  spike N501Y . Combining UDG-RT-LAMP technology  CRISPR-LAMP design  and mutation detection design  we developed a CRISPR-LAMP detection platform that can precisely diagnose pathogens with better stability and significantly improved point mutation detection efficiency.

Whole genome sequencing  WGS  revealed a new variant  currently defining a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage: B.1.616. In March  WHO classified this variant as ‘under investigation’  VUI . We analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 cases related to this new variant. METHODS: Clinical  virological  and radiological data were retrospectively collected from medical charts in the two hospitals involved. We enrolled inpatients with either: i  positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on a respiratory sample; ii  seroconversion with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG IgM; iii  suggestive symptoms and typical features of COVID-19 on a chest CT scan. Cases were categorized as either: i  B.1.616; ii  variant of concern  VOC ; iii  unknown. RESULTS: From January 1 st  to March 24 th   2021  114 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria: B.1.616  n=39   VOC  n=32   and unknown  n=43 . B.1.616-related cases were older than VOC-related cases  81 years interquartile range [IQR] [73-88]  vs 73 years IQR [67-82]  P<0.05  and their first RT-PCR tests were rarely positive  6 39  15% vs 31 32  97%  P<0.05 . B.1.616 variant was independently associated with severe disease  multivariable Cox model HR 4.0 95% CI [1.5-10.9]   and increased lethality: 28-day mortality 18 39  46%  for B.1.616  vs. 5 32  16%  for VOC  P=0.006. CONCLUSION: We report a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 cases related to a new variant  B.1.616  poorly detected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples  with high lethality.

Therefore  it is imperative to understand the distribution of several variants of concern in the population  which could have implications for transmissibility and vaccine efficacy. Methods Between February and May 2021  SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using the Oxford nanopore MinION method and the respective genome diversity was elucidated. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and genomes were classified using pangolin lineages. Results The results highlight the increase  46%  of the alpha variant of concern  B.1.1.7  in the Gabonese population over the study period. In addition  an increase  31%  in the B.1.1.318 lineage  which is associated with high transmission and impaired vaccine efficacy  D614G+E484K+Y144del   was detected. Conclusion With the second wave ongoing  our findings highlight the need for surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the Republic of Gabon and should provide useful guidance to policy makers in selecting an appropriate vaccine for the population.

With the global transmission of the virus  a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared  especially  emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom  variant 20I 501Y.V1  lineage B.1.1.7   South Africa  variant 20H 501Y.V2  lineage B.1.351   and Brazil  variant 20 J 501Y.V3  and lineage P.1 . The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein  which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore  mutations such as N501Y  E484K  and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However  current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking. Herein  we briefly explain why most COVID-19 vaccines target the S protein  update the progress of research regarding S protein-related COVID-19 vaccines  review the latest studies concerning the effects of S protein variants on COVID-19 vaccines  and finally  propose certain strategies to deal with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

A variant emerging from the United Kingdom called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012 01  or B.1.1.7  is thought to exhibit increased transmissibility that results from replication 4–10 times faster than the original Wuhan virus  Wuhan-Hu-1 . Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein  D614G  there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle  or evasion of the immune response  by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer  protomer  complexed to ACE2. Importantly  4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D  D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer  potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits  dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms. These data suggest that combined characteristics of mutations unique to UK variant B.1.1.7 enable high affinity binding to ACE2 and enhanced replication properties. The D614G mutation  associated with enhanced virus transmissibility  opens a potentially druggable structural pocket at the interface between spike glycoprotein subunits S1 and S2.

In order to estimate the duration of immunity induced by SARS‐CoV‐2 it is important to understand for how long antibodies persist after infection in humans. Here  we assessed the persistence of serum antibodies following WT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection at 8 and 13 months after diagnosis in 367 individuals. The SARS‐CoV‐2 spike IgG  S‐IgG  and nucleoprotein IgG  N‐IgG  concentrations and the proportion of subjects with neutralizing antibodies  NAb  were assessed. Moreover  the NAb titers among a smaller subset of participants  n = 78  against a WT virus  B  and variants of concern  VOCs : Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta  B.1.617.2  were determined. We found that NAb against the WT virus persisted in 89% and S‐IgG in 97% of subjects for at least 13 months after infection. Only 36% had N‐IgG by 13 months. The mean S‐IgG concentrations declined from 8 to 13 months by less than one third; N‐IgG concentrations declined by two‐thirds. Subjects with severe infection had markedly higher IgG and NAb levels and are expected to remain seropositive for longer. Significantly lower NAb titers against the variants compared to the WT virus  especially after a mild disease  suggests reduced protection against VOCs.

It was previously reported that the ORF8 protein inhibits the presentation of viral antigens by the major histocompatibility complex class I  MHC-I   which interacts with host factors involved in pulmonary inflammation. The ORF8 protein assists SARS-CoV-2 in evading immunity and plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Among many contributing mutations  Q27STOP  a mutation in the ORF8 protein  defines the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2  engendering the second wave of COVID-19. In the present study  47 unique truncated ORF8 proteins  T-ORF8  with the Q27STOP mutations were identified among 49 055 available B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The results show that only one of the 47 T-ORF8 variants spread to over 57 geo-locations in North America  and other continents  which include Africa  Asia  Europe and South America. Based on various quantitative features  such as amino acid homology  polar non-polar sequence homology  Shannon entropy conservation  and other physicochemical properties of all specific 47 T-ORF8 protein variants  nine possible T-ORF8 unique variants were defined. The question as to whether T-ORF8 variants function similarly to the wild type ORF8 is yet to be investigated. A positive response to the question could exacerbate future COVID-19 waves  necessitating severe containment measures.

Methods SARS-CoV-2 lineages reported from South American countries were analyzed from a public dataset of 5597 genome assemblies. Polymorphisms in the main open reading frames were identified and compared to those present in the main lineages of epidemiology concern: B.1.1.7  from UK  and B.1.351  from South Africa . Results A total of 169 circulating lineages across 16 South American countries were identified  revealing a predominant circulation of the major lineage B  the one with the greatest diversity and broadest geographic distribution. Sixteen lineages were selected to be comprehensively analyzed because are predominant in the region. Two lineages of concern report were remarkably identified: P.1 recognized as the Brazilian variant  with 94 genomes  and B.1.1.7 the UK variant  with 28 genomes   both displayed 33 polymorphisms compared to the reference genome  the highest number among analyzed genomes. While the most of other lineages circulating in SA displayed 24 or less polymorphisms compared to the reference strain. A high number of polymorphisms were detected in the evaluated lineages with a limited number of common variable positions amongst them  in agreement with the profiles identified in the main lineages of epidemiology concern. Conclusions The ever-increasing genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 continues to lead to the emergence of novel lineages. Different variants and lineages are now present across SA with the presence of major lineage B mostly. The circulation of variants as P.1 and B.1.1.7 in different countries as well as the elevated number of polymorphisms highlighted the importance of continuing with the genomic surveillance to determine introduction events  identify transmission chains  trace emergence and help to implement successful prevention  vaccination and control strategies.

Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However  new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil  B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK  12  10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively . All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K  K417N T and N501Y  which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that  surprisingly  P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations  we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.

We demonstrated that mouse plasma induced by self-assembling protein nanoparticles  SApNPs  that present 20 rationally designed S2GΔHR2 spikes of the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 strain can neutralize the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617 variants with comparable potency. The adjuvant effect on vaccine-induced immunity was investigated by testing 16 formulations for the multilayered I3-01v9 SApNP. Using single-cell sorting  monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  with diverse neutralization breadth and potency were isolated from mice immunized with the receptor binding domain  RBD   S2GΔHR2 spike  and SApNP vaccines. The mechanism of vaccine-induced immunity was examined in the mouse model. Compared with the soluble spike  the I3-01v9 SApNP showed sixfold longer retention  fourfold greater presentation on follicular dendritic cell dendrites  and fivefold stronger germinal center reactions in lymph node follicles.

Subunit vaccines use one or more antigens suitable for eliciting a robust immune response. However  the major concern is the efficacy of subunit vaccines and elicited antibodies to neutralize the variants of SARS-CoV-2 like B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta  and P1  Gamma   B.1.617  Delta  and C.37  Lambda . The Spike protein  S  is a potential fragment for use as an antigen in vaccine development. This protein plays a crucial role in the first step of the infection process  as it binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor and enters the host cell after binding. Immunization-induced specific antibodies against the receptor binding domain  RBD  may block and effectively prevent virus invasion. The focus of this review is the impact of spike mutated variants of SARS-CoV2  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta  and Lambda  on the efficacy of subunit recombinant vaccines. To date  a low or no significant impact on vaccine efficacy against Alpha and Delta variants has been reported. Such an impact on vaccine efficacy for Beta  Delta  Gamma  and Lambda variants may be even greater compared to the Alpha variant. Nonetheless  more comprehensive analyses are needed to assess the real impact on vaccine efficacy brought about by SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In this retrospective study  we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020. METHODS: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health  and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all patients with VOC infection admitted to our center between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted from January-April 2020. RESULTS: 829 patients in Singapore in the study period were infected with these 3 VOCs. After adjusting for age and sex  B.1.617.2 was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement  ICU admission  or death  adjusted odds ratio  aOR  4.90  [95% CI 1.43-30.78] . 157 of these patients were admitted to our center. After adjusting for age  sex  comorbidities  and vaccination  aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1.88 [95% CI 0.95-3.76]  compared with wild-type. These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30  median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2  13 days for wild-type . CONCLUSIONS: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.

The teacher reported becoming symptomatic on May 19  but continued to work for 2 days before receiving a test on May 21. On occasion during this time  the teacher read aloud unmasked to the class despite school requirements to mask while indoors. Beginning May 23  additional cases of COVID-19 were reported among other staff members  students  parents  and siblings connected to the school. To characterize the outbreak  on May 26  MCPH initiated case investigation and contact tracing that included whole genome sequencing  WGS  of available specimens. A total of 27 cases were identified  including that of the teacher. During May 23-26  among the teacher's 24 students  22 students  all ineligible for vaccination because of age  received testing for SARS-CoV-2; 12 received positive test results. The attack rate in the two rows seated closest to the teacher's desk was 80%  eight of 10  and was 28%  four of 14  in the three back rows  Fisher's exact test; p = 0.036 . During May 24-June 1  six of 18 students in a separate grade at the school  all also too young for vaccination  received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Eight additional cases were also identified  all in parents and siblings of students in these two grades. Among these additional cases  three were in persons fully vaccinated in accordance with CDC recommendations  1 . Among the 27 total cases  22  81%  persons reported symptoms; the most frequently reported symptoms were fever  41%   cough  33%   headache  26%   and sore throat  26% . WGS of all 18 available specimens identified the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant. Vaccines are effective against the Delta variant  2   but risk of transmission remains elevated among unvaccinated persons in schools without strict adherence to prevention strategies. In addition to vaccination for eligible persons  strict adherence to nonpharmaceutical prevention strategies  including masking  routine testing  facility ventilation  and staying home when symptomatic  are important to ensure safe in-person learning in schools  3 .

He was admitted to the Central Hospital of Baoan immediately. This patient preliminarily tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  infection  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  qRT-PCR  method in this hospital. Then  a mixed specimen of nasopharyngeal swab  oropharyngeal swab  and anal swab was sent to the virology laboratory of Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention  Shenzhen CDC  and was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a qRT-PCR method simultaneously implemented in two commercial kits  Daan  Guangzhou  China and Bojie  Shanghai  China   Supplementary Table S1 . This patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on June 8  2021 and participated in an epidemiological investigation and sampling in a flight from South Africa that arrived at Baoan International Airport on June 10  2021. Between June 10  2021 and June 25  2021  a total of 39 passengers  Case 1 to 39  from this flight were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the virology laboratory of Shenzhen CDC. On June 17  2021  a third-party laboratory detected SARS-CoV-2 in a mixed specimen of 10 swabs from ten individuals by qRT-PCR method  and the preliminary result was positive. This mixed specimen and one  Case B  of ten nasopharyngeal swabs from ten individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the virology laboratory of Shenzhen CDC. Case B was a 22-year-old female who worked in a restaurant at Baoan International Airport. The third case  Case C  lived in Dongguan City and worked in Nanshan District in Shenzhen City. He presented symptoms of chills  dry cough  diarrhea  and fever on June 12  2021 and was confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 on June 18  2021. The fourth case  Case D  lived and worked in Baoan District  Shenzhen. She was confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during screening of key populations on June 20  2021. High-throughput sequencing was performed for 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 39 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains by Illumina Sequencing Technology. First  viral RNA was extracted directly from 200-μL swab samples using a High Pure Viral RNA Kit  Roche  Germany . Second  viral RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified using ULSEN® 2019-nCoV Whole Genome Capture Kit  Beijing MicroFuture  V-090418 . Third  the sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit. The final viral-enriched libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The viral genome was assembled by MicronCoV® Analyzer  Beijing MicroFuture  M-881027 . Genome sequences of the 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 28 of 39 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains were successfully determined. Virus strains from this study were genotyped using the online Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner  www.pangolin.cog-uk.io  . The evolutionary relationship of local SARS-CoV-2 strains and imported SARS-CoV-2 strains was inferred with the program MEGA version Ⅹ  www.megasoftware.net   1 . Nucleotide difference between viral genome sequences from this study and the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1  GenBank no. NC_045512.2  was analyzed using the programs BioEdit 7.1.9  www.bioedit.software.informer.com  and MEGA versionⅩ. The 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 26 of 28 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study were assigned to lineage B.1.617.2  Supplementary Table S2   which was the fourth variant of concern  VOC   Delta variant . The other two imported SARS-CoV-2 strains were assigned to lineage B.1.351 and lineage C.1.2. Molecular phylogeny indicated that 30 SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants  lineage B.1.617.2  from this study formed 2 distinct clades  Figure 1 . The imported strain hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-0610-01 2021  Case1  clustered in clade A and showed the closest relationship to the Indian strain hCoV-19 India GJ-NCDC-NIV-INSACOG-24095 2021 by an Audacity Instant search in Global initiative on sharing all influenza data  GISAID . The 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 and 25 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 clustered in clade B and showed the closest relationship or showed only one nucleotide difference to the British strain hCoV-19 England MILK-155F811 2021. These 29 SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 showed at least 23 nucleotide differences to the strain hCoV-19  Shenzhen IVDC-0610-01 2021  Case 1 . In clade B  the imported strain hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-0610-04 2021  Case 4  showed a certain degree of genetic distance to the other 28 virus strains from this study  which was also indicated by comparative analysis of genome sequences in the Table 1. The local B.1.617.2 strain hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-06-14 2021  Case A  showed 100% sequence identity to 19 imported B.1.617.2 strains  Table 1 . These 20 SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 shared 31 nucleotide variation sites and 22 deletion mutations compared with the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1. Except for the variation sites above  an additional variation site was observed in genomes of the 3 local strains hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-06-17 2021  Case B   hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-06-18 2021  Case C   and hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-06-20 2021  Case D . The local strain hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-06-17 2021  Case B  showed 100% sequence identity to the strain hCoV-19 Shenzhen IVDC-0610-20 2021 from imported Case 20. Among imported SARS-CoV-2 strains  genome sequences of 19 SARS-CoV-2 strains from imported passengers showed 100% sequence identity to each other  and these 19 passengers had no common exposure history before boarding. It suggested that at least one virus transmission occurred between the 19 passengers after boarding. The only strain from Case 1 belonged to clade A within lineage B.1.617.2  which indicated that Case 1 was not related to the infection in the cabin. Based on phylogenetic relationship and comparative analysis of genome sequences  we deduced that 3 virus strains from local cases  Cases B to D  and 5 virus strains from imported passengers  Cases 10  20  34  37  and 39  were progeny viruses. According to the report by Li et al  2   SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant strains from this study showed 18 to 28 nucleotide differences to those from the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangzhou  May 2021  which suggested that SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant that caused local outbreaks of COVID-19 in Guangzhou and Shenzhen came from different sources. At present  the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is becoming the dominant variant worldwide and has been detected in at least 142 countries as of August 10  2021. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is posing new challenges on the control and prevention of COVID-19 due to its increased transmissibility compared with Alpha variant  lineage B.1.1.7  and capacity of immune escape  3-7 . In conclusion  whole-genome sequencing  WGS  confirmed that 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 26 of 28 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study were Delta variants  and phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses showed close relationship between the four local SARS-CoV-2 strains of Delta variant and imported SARS-CoV-2 strains of Delta variant introduced from South Africa.

Pharmacokinetic and Safety Phase 1 Study and Microneutralization Assay Results with BRII-196 BRII-198  a Novel Antibody Cocktail Active Against a Wide Range of SARS-CoV-2 Variants,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.719,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.719,,pmc:PMC8644370,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,520. Pharmacokinetic and Safety Phase 1 Study and Microneutralization Assay Results with BRII-196 BRII-198  a Novel Antibody Cocktail Active Against a Wide Range of SARS-CoV-2 Variants,BACKGROUND: BRII-196 and BRII-198 are human monoclonal antibodies  mAb  with an extended half-life targeting distinct epitopes of the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2. Mutations in these epitope regions are continuously emerging  potentially conferring resistance to COVID-19 therapeutics in development. Individual phase I studies showed that BRII-196 or BRII-198 alone were safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. The BRII-196 and BRII-198 cocktail is currently under evaluation in Phase 2 3 studies for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Preclinical study: BRII-196 and BRII-198 were evaluated in the microneutralization assay using pseudo-viruses encoding mutations identified in the spike protein of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns  including strains originating in UK  SA  BR  CA  and India. The fold-change in neutralization IC 50  titers relative to wild-type virus was calculated. Phase 1 study: healthy adults received sequential IV BRII-196 and BRII-198  n=9  or placebo  n=3 ; and were followed for 180 days. Two dose levels  750mg 750mg and 1500mg 1500mg  were evaluated for safety  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Interim analysis results are presented. RESULTS: Preclinical: BRII-196 and BRII-198 exhibited neutralizing activity against pseudo-virus variants that contained spike mutations of a panel of variants including B.1.1.7  UK   B.1.351 SA   P.1 BR   B.1.427 429  CA   B.1.526  NY   and B.1.617  IN   comparable to that against wild-type virus. Phase I study: BRII-196 plus BRII-198 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting adverse events  AEs   deaths  serious adverse events  or infusion reactions. The majority of AEs were isolated asymptomatic grade 1-2 laboratory abnormalities.  Table 1 . Each mAb displayed pharmacokinetic characteristics expected of extended half-life YTE-antibodies. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The BRII-196 and BRII-198 cocktail was well-tolerated  and maintains neutralization against currently reported circulating variants of concern. These preclinical and clinical results support further development of BRII-196 and BRII-198 as a therapeutic or prophylactic option for SARS-CoV-2. DISCLOSURES: David A.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein of variants B.1.1.7  B1.351  and P.1 have raised concerns that the efficacy of current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies could be threatened. In vitro studies have shown that one mutation  E484K  plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of some monoclonal antibodies as well as most convalescent and vaccinee sera against variant B.1.351. In fact  two vaccine trials have recently reported lower protective efficacy in South Africa  where B.1.351 is dominant. To survey for these novel variants in our patient population in New York City  PCR assays were designed to identify viruses with two signature mutations  E484K and N501Y. We observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late December to mid-February  with an alarming rise to 12.3% in the past two weeks. Whole genome sequencing further demonstrated that most of our E484K isolates  n=49 65  fell within a single lineage: NextStrain clade 20C or Pangolin lineage B.1.526. Patients with this novel variant came from diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan area  and they were on average older and more frequently hospitalized. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences in the database further reveal that this B.1.526 variant is scattered in the Northeast of US  and its unique set of spike mutations may also pose an antigenic challenge for current interventions.

On November 29  the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was notified of six probable cases of COVID-19 in one household  including one case in a man aged 48 years  the index patient  who had recently returned from Nigeria. Given the patient's travel history  Omicron infection was suspected. Specimens from all six persons in the household tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  testing on December 1  and the following day genomic sequencing by the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory identified an identical Omicron genotype from each specimen  Figure . Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine if this cluster represented an independent introduction of Omicron into the United States  and a detailed epidemiologic investigation was conducted. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§.

During the spread of SARS-CoV-2  weakened host immunity and the use of vaccines with low efficacy may result in the development of more-virulent strains or strains with resistance to existing vaccines and antibodies. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains differs between regions  and this variation may have an impact on the effectiveness of vaccines. In this study  an epidemiological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal was performed  and the VSV-ΔG-G* pseudovirus system was used to construct 12 spike protein epidemic mutants  D614G  A222V+D614G  B.1.1.7  S477N+D614G  P1162R+D614G+A222V  D839Y+D614G  L176F+D614G  B.1.1.7+L216F  B.1.1.7+M740V  B.1.258  B.1.258+L1063F  and B.1.258+N751Y. The mutant pseudoviruses were used to infect four susceptible cell lines  Huh7  hACE2-293T-293T  Vero  and LLC-MK2  and 14 cell lines overexpressing ACE2 from different species. Mutant strains did not show increased infectivity or cross-species transmission. Neutralization activity against these pseudoviruses was evaluated using mouse serum and 11 monoclonal antibodies. The neutralizing activity of immunized mouse serum was not significantly reduced with the mutant strains  but the mutant strains from Portugal could evade nine of the 11 monoclonal antibodies tested. Neutralization resistance was mainly caused by the mutations S477N  N439K  and N501Y in the spike-receptor binding domain. These findings emphasize the importance of SARS-CoV-2 mutation tracking in different regions for epidemic prevention and control.

We observed that the phylogenetic proximity of vertebrate ACE2 receptors does not affect the binding energy for the viral spike protein. However  all viral variants seem to bind ACE2 better in many animals than in humans. Moreover  two observations highlight that the evolution of the virus started at the beginning of 2020 and culminated with the appearance of the variants. First  codon usage analysis shows that the B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta  and B.1.617.2  delta  variants  similar in the use of codons  are also similar to a virus sampled in January 2020. Second  the host-specific D614G mutation becomes prevalent starting from March 2020. Overall  we show that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a process of molecular evolution that begins with the optimization of codons followed by the functional optimization of the spike protein.

The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein  and is implicated in multiple viral functions  including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulphate proteoglycan  viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes  and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade  B.1.I82T  defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3  the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021  a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall  M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021  similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages  which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation  V70L  also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. These M mutations are associated with younger patient age  4.6 to 6.3 years . The rapid emergence of this B.1.I82T clade  recently named Pangolin B.1.575 lineage  suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit  perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication  and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.

Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However  little attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses by new lineages. In this work  we predicted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and their potential to trigger or hinder CD8+ T cell response by using HLA binding and TCR reactivity in silico predictions. Also  we estimated the population's coverage for different lineages  which accounts for the ability to present a set of peptides based on the most frequent HLA alleles of a given population. We considered binding predictions to 110 class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages. We observed a higher population coverage for the variant detected in the UK  B.1.1.7   and South Africa  B.1.351   as well as for the Brazilian P.1 lineage  but not P.2  compared to the reference lineage. Moreover  individual mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid D138Y were predicted to have an overall stronger affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence while Spike E484K shows signs of evasion. In summary  we provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants  but also mutant peptides exhibiting diminished or abolished HLA-I binding. It also highlights the augmented population coverage for three new lineages. Whether these changes imply more T cell reactivity or potential to evade from CD8+ T cell responses requires experimental verification.

At this time  trial data was lacking  and we addressed this in a study of UK healthcare workers. The first vaccine dose induced protection from infection from the circulating alpha  B.1.1.7  variant over several weeks. In a sub-study of 589 individuals  we show that this single dose induces SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody  NAb  responses and a sustained B and T cell response to spike protein. NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval  6-14 weeks  compared to the conventional 3-4 week regimen  accompanied by enrichment of CD4+ T cells expressing IL2. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection amplified and accelerated the response. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective  immunogenic protocol.

Non-synonymous substitutions affecting S are not uncommon and have become fixed in a number of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. A subset of such mutations enable escape from neutralizing antibodies or are thought to enhance transmission through mechanisms such as increased affinity for the cell entry receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2 . Independent genomic surveillance programs based in New Mexico and Louisiana contemporaneously detected the rapid rise of numerous clade 20G  lineage B.1.2  infections carrying a Q677P substitution in S. The variant was first detected in the US on October 23  yet between 01 Dec 2020 and 19 Jan 2021 it rose to represent 27.8% and 11.3% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from Louisiana and New Mexico  respectively. Q677P cases have been detected predominantly in the south central and southwest United States; as of 03 Feb 2021  GISAID data show 499 viral sequences of this variant from the USA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the independent evolution and spread of at least six distinct Q677H sub-lineages  with first collection dates ranging from mid-August to late November 2020. Four 677H clades from clade 20G  B.1.2   20A  B.1.234   and 20B  B.1.1.220  and B.1.1.222  each contain roughly 100 or fewer sequenced cases  while a distinct pair of clade 20G clusters are represented by 754 and 298 cases  respectively. Although sampling bias and founder effects may have contributed to the rise of S:677 polymorphic variants  the proximity of this position to the polybasic cleavage site at the S1 S2 boundary are consistent with its potential functional relevance during cell entry  suggesting parallel evolution of a trait that may confer an advantage in spread or transmission. Taken together  our findings demonstrate simultaneous convergent evolution  thus providing an impetus to further evaluate S:677 polymorphisms for effects on proteolytic processing  cell tropism  and transmissibility.

In this study  a detection methodology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  wildtype and variants of concern  in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes  E and ORF1ab  by polyethylene glycol  PEG  precipitation and digital droplet PCR. This methodology was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the proportion of N501Y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Karlsruhe in south-western Germany over a period of 1 year  June 2020 to July 2021 . Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with reported COVID-19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation. As the clinical SARS-CoV-2 official case report chain takes time  viral RNA titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data  demonstrating the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning system. Parallel PCR analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with E  ORF  RdRP2 and NSP9 assays. RdPP1 and NSP3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers  and in particular for N1 there was low correlation with the other assays. The occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the wastewater of Karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha-variant  B.1.1.7  in the corresponding individual clinical tests. In batch experiments SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions  but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Overall  this study shows that wastewater-based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage  contributing to successful pandemic management.

We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of three sample-to-answer molecular-diagnostics systems for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using 325 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples from symptomatic patients. METHODS: The BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1  RP2.1   cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A B  and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Flu RSV platforms  which have been granted emergency-use authorization by the US FDA  were tested and compared. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement  negative percent agreement  and overall percent agreement among the three point of care testing systems were 98–100%  including for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2  non-B.1.1.7  and a variant of concern  B.1.1.7 . Notably  the BioFire RP2.1 may fail to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S gene in the B.1.1.7 lineage because of the spike protein mutation. CONCLUSION: All three point of care testing platforms provided highly sensitive  robust  and almost accurate results for rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2. These automated molecular diagnostic assays can increase the effectiveness of control and prevention measures for infectious diseases.

Independent studies have shown that mutant variants are partially or completely resistant against some of the therapeutic antibodies authorized for emergency use. METHODS: We employed hybridoma technology  ELISA-based and cell-based S-ACE2 interaction assays combined with authentic virus neutralization assays to develop second-generation antibodies  which were specifically selected for their ability to neutralize the new variants of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: AX290 and AX677  two monoclonal antibodies with non-overlapping epitopes  exhibit subnanomolar or nanomolar affinities to the receptor binding domain of the viral Spike protein carrying amino acid substitutions N501Y  N439K  E484K  K417N  and a combination N501Y E484K K417N found in the circulating virus variants. The antibodies showed excellent neutralization of an authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus representing strains circulating in Europe in spring 2020 and also the variants of concern B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.617.2  Delta . In addition  AX677 is able to bind Omicron Spike protein just like the wild type Spike. The combination of the two antibodies prevented the appearance of escape mutations of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Prophylactic administration of AX290 and AX677  either individually or in combination  effectively reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lungs  and prevented disease in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERPRETATION: The virus-neutralizing properties were fully reproduced in chimeric mouse-human versions of the antibodies  which may represent a promising tool for COVID-19 therapy. FUNDING: The study was funded by AXON Neuroscience SE and AXON COVIDAX a.s.

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies  research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020  the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory  composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020  more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation  which was identified in three different lineages  P.1  P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9  in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein  leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.

This review summarizes the highly mutated regions  the essential infectivity  transmission  vaccine breakthrough and antibody resistance of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The Omicron is highly transmissible and is spreading faster than any previous variant  but may cause less severe symptoms than previous variants. The Omicron is able to escape the immune system’s defenses and coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines are less effective against the Omicron variant. Early careful preventive steps including vaccination will always be key for the suppression of the Omicron variant.

The delta variant and other variants of concern  VoC  carry spike  S -protein mutations  which have the potential to evade protective immunity  to trigger break-through infections after COVID-19 vaccination  and to propagate future waves of COVID-19 pandemic. To identify SARS CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh  patients who are RT-PCR-positive for COVID-19 infections in Dhaka were screened by a RT-PCR melting curve analysis for spike protein mutations. To assess the anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody responses  the levels of the anti-S -proteins IgA and IgG and the anti-N-protein IgG were measured by ELISA. Of a total of 36 RT-PCR positive samples  75%   27 were identified as delta variants  with one carrying an additional Q677H mutation and two with single nucleotide substitutions at position 23029  compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 reference NC 045512  in the genome sequence. Three  8.3%  were identified as beta variants  two  5.5%  were identified as alpha variants  three  8.3%  were identified as having a B.1.1.318 lineage  and one sample was identified as an eta variant  B.1.525  carrying an additional V687L mutation. The trend of higher viral load  lower Cp values  among delta variants than in the alpha and beta variants was of borderline statistical significance  p = 0.045 . Prospective studies with larger Bangladeshi cohorts are warranted to confirm the emergence of S-protein mutations and their association with antibody response in natural infection and potential breakthrough in vaccinated subjects.

The rapid pace of vaccine development has resulted in multiple vaccines already in use worldwide. The contemporaneous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 ‘variants of concern’  VOC  across diverse geographic locales underscores the need to monitor the efficacy of vaccines being administered globally. All WHO designated VOC carry spike  S  polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies. Here  we characterize the neutralizing activity of post-Sputnik V vaccination sera against the ensemble of S mutations present in alpha  B.1.1.7  and beta  B.1.351  VOC. Using de novo generated replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus expressing various SARS-CoV-2-S in place of VSV-G  rcVSV-CoV2-S   coupled with a clonal 293T-ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell line optimized for highly efficient S-mediated infection  we determine that only 1 out of 12 post-vaccination serum samples shows effective neutralization  IC 90   of rcVSV-CoV2-S: B.1.351 at full serum strength. The same set of sera efficiently neutralize S from B.1.1.7 and exhibit only moderately reduced activity against S carrying the E484K substitution alone. Taken together  our data suggest that control of some emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may benefit from updated vaccines.

SARS-CoV  MERS-CoV  and SARS-CoV-2 are also classified as β-coronavirus. New SARS-CoV-2 spike genomic variants are responsible for human-to-human and interspecies transmissibility  consequences of adaptations of strains from animals to humans. The receptor-binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2 binds to receptor ACE2 in humans and animal species with high affinity  suggesting there have been adaptive genomic variants. New genomic variants including the incorporation  replacement  or deletion of the amino acids at a variety of positions in the S protein have been documented and are associated with the emergence of new strains adapted to different hosts. Interactions between mutated residues and RBD have been demonstrated by structural modelling of variants including D614G  B.1.1.7  B1.351  P.1  P2; other genomic variants allow escape from antibodies generated by vaccines. Epidemiological and molecular tools are being used for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution and particularly new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Biotechnology strategies of the first generation  attenuated and inactivated virus–CoronaVac  CoVaxin; BBIBP-CorV   second generation  replicating-incompetent vector vaccines–ChAdOx-1; Ad5-nCoV; Sputnik V; JNJ-78436735 vaccine-replicating-competent vector  protein subunits  virus-like particles–NVX-CoV2373 vaccine   and third generation  nucleic-acid vaccines–INO-4800  DNA ; mRNA-1273 and BNT 162b  RNA vaccines  have been used. Additionally  dendritic cells  LV-SMENP-DC  and artificial antigen-presenting  aAPC  cells modified with lentiviral vector have also been developed to inhibit viral activity.

The current study aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in Egypt. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 197 suspected patients who were admitted to the Army Hospital and confirmation of the positivity was performed by rRT-PCR assay. Whole genomic sequencing was conducted using Illumina iSeq 100® System. The average age of the participants was 48 years  of which 132  67%  were male. The main clinical symptoms were pneumonia  98%   fever  92%   and dry cough  66% . The results of the laboratory showed that lymphocytopenia  79.2%   decreased levels of haemoglobin  77.7%   increased levels of interleukin 6  C-reactive protein  serum ferritin  and D-dimer  77.2%  55.3%  55.3%  and 25.9%  respectively   and leukocytopenia  25.9%  were more common. The CT findings showed that scattered opacities  55.8%  and ground-glass appearance  27.9%  were frequently reported. The recovered validated sequences  n = 144  were submitted to NCBI Virus GenBank. All sequenced viruses have at least 99% identity to Wuhan-Hu-1. All variants were GH clade  B.1 PANGO lineage  and L.GP.YP.HT haplotype. The most predominant subclade was D614G Q57H V5F G823S. Our findings have aided in a deep understanding of COVID-19 evolution and identifying strains with unique mutational patterns in Egypt.

A simple and rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 variants is an unmet need and is of great public health importance. In this study  we designed and analytically validated a CRISPR-Cas12a system for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. We further evaluated the combination of ordinary reverse transcription-PCR  RT-PCR  and CRISPR-Cas12a to improve the detection sensitivity and developed a universal system by introducing a protospacer adjacent motif  PAM  near the target mutation sites through PCR primer design to detect mutations without PAM. Our results indicated that the CRISPR-Cas12a assay could readily detect the signature spike protein mutations  K417N T  L452R Q  T478K  E484K Q  N501Y  and D614G  to distinguish alpha  beta  gamma  delta  kappa  lambda  and epsilon variants of SARS-CoV-2. In addition  the open reading frame 8  ORF8  mutations  T C substitution at nt28144 and the corresponding change of amino acid L S  could differentiate L and S lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The low limit of detection could reach 10 copies reaction. Our assay successfully distinguished 4 SARS-CoV-2 strains of wild type and alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   and delta  B.1.617.2  variants. By testing 32 SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples infected with the wild type  n = 5  and alpha  n = 11   beta  n = 8   and delta variants  n = 8   the concordance between our assay and sequencing was 100%. The CRISPR-based approach is rapid and robust and can be adapted for screening the emerging mutations and immediately implemented in laboratories already performing nucleic acid amplification tests or in resource-limited settings. IMPORTANCE We described CRISPR-Cas12-based multiplex allele-specific assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 variant genotyping. The new system has the potential to be quickly developed  continuously updated  and easily implemented for screening of SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. This approach can be adapted for emerging mutations and implemented in laboratories already conducting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests using existing resources and extracted nucleic acid.

In this study  we aimed to report the early estimates of the serial interval distribution and reproduction number to quantify the transmissibility of the omicron variant in South Korea between 25 November 2021 and 31 December 2021. We analyzed 427 local omicron cases and reconstructed 73 transmission pairs. We used a maximum likelihood estimation to assess serial interval distribution from transmission pair data and reproduction numbers from 74 local cases in the first local outbreak. We estimated that the mean serial interval was 3.78  standard deviation  0.76  days  which was significantly shorter in child infectors  3.0 days  compared to adult infectors  5.0 days   p < 0.01 . We estimated the mean reproduction number was 1.72  95% CrI  1.60–1.85  for the omicron variant during the first local outbreak. Strict adherence to public health measures  particularly in children  should be in place to reduce the transmission risk of the highly transmissible omicron variant in the community.

Currently  studies describing the neutralization ability of different homologous and heterologous booster vaccination against Omicron are still lacking. In this study  we explored the immunogenicity of COVID-19 breakthrough patients  BBIBP-CorV homologous booster group and BBIBP-CorV ZF2001 heterologous booster group against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes corresponding to the prototype  Beta  Delta  and the emergent Omicron variant. Notably  at 14 days post two-dose inactivated vaccines  pVNT titre increased to 67.4 GMTs against prototype  8.85 against Beta and 35.07 against Delta  while neutralization activity against Omicron was below the lower limit of quantitation in 80% of the samples. At day 14 post BBIBP-CorV homologous booster vaccination  GMTs of pVNT significantly increased to 285.6  215.7  250.8  48.73 against prototype  Beta  Delta  and Omicron  while at day 14 post ZF2001 heterologous booster vaccination  GMTs of pVNT significantly increased to 1436.00  789.6  1501.00  95.86  respectively. Post booster vaccination  100% samples showed positive neutralization activity against Omicron  albeit illustrated a significant reduction  5.86- to 14.98-fold  of pVNT against Omicron compared to prototype at 14 days after the homologous or heterologous vaccine boosters. Overall  our study demonstrates that vaccine-induced immune protection might more likely be escaped by Omicron compared to prototypes and other VOCs. After two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines as the “priming” shot  a third heterologous protein subunit vaccine and a homologous inactivated vaccine booster could improve neutralization against Omicron.

Herein  we characterize a human V H  domain  F6  which we generated by sequentially panning large phage displayed V H  libraries against receptor binding domains  RBDs  containing VOC mutations. Cryo-EM analyses reveal that F6 has a unique binding mode that spans a broad surface of the RBD and involves the antibody framework region. Attachment of an Fc region to a fusion of F6 and ab8  a previously characterized V H  domain  resulted in a construct  F6-ab8-Fc  that neutralized Omicron pseudoviruses with a half-maximal neutralizing concentration  IC 50   of 4.8 nM in vitro. Additionally  prophylactic treatment using F6-ab8-Fc reduced live Beta  B.1.351  variant viral titers in the lungs of a mouse model. Our results provide a new potential therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs - including the recently emerged Omicron variant - and highlight a vulnerable epitope within the spike protein RBD that may be exploited to achieve broad protection against circulating variants.

In this case report  we identified the natural infection of two cats by SARS-CoV-2  in Argentina  whose owner had been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. Viral genetic material was detected in feline oropharyngeal  OP  and rectal  R  swab by RT-qPCR  and sequence analysis revealed that the virus infecting the owner and one cat were genetically similar. The alpha variant  B.1.1.7 lineage  was identified with a unique additional mutation  strongly suggesting human-to-cat route of transmission. This study reinforces the One Health concept and the importance of integrating human  animal  and environmental perspectives to promptly address relevant health issues.

We applied neutralization tests to paired recoveree sera  n = 38  using clinical isolates representing the first wave  D614G   VoC1  and VoC2 lineages  B.1.1.7 and B 1.351 . Neutralizing antibodies inhibited contemporary and VoC1 lineages  whereas inhibition of VoC2 was reduced 8-fold  with 50% of sera failing to show neutralization. These results provide evidence for the increased potential of VoC2 to reinfect previously SARS-CoV-infected individuals. The kinetics of NAbs in different patients showed similar decline against all variants  with generally low initial anti-B.1.351 responses becoming undetectable  but with anti-B.1.1.7 NAbs remaining detectable  >20  for months after acute infection.

A highly specific and sensitive diagnostic test able to differentiate the SARS-CoV-2 virus from common human coronaviruses is therefore needed. Coronavirus nucleoprotein  N  localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus  and are required for viral RNA synthesis. N is the most abundant coronavirus protein  so it is of utmost importance to develop specific antibodies for its detection. In this study  we developed a sandwich immunoassay to recognize the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. We immunized one alpaca with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N and constructed a large single variable domain on heavy chain  VHH  antibody library. After phage display selection  7 VHHs recognizing the full N protein were identified by ELISA. These VHHs did not recognize the nucleoproteins of the four common human coronaviruses. Hydrogen Deuterium eXchange-Mass Spectrometry  HDX-MS  analysis also showed that these VHHs mainly targeted conformational epitopes in either the C-terminal or the N-terminal domains. All VHHs were able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells or on infected hamster tissues. Moreover  the VHHs could detect the SARS variants B.1.17 alpha  B.1.351 beta and P1 gamma. We propose that this sandwich immunoassay could be applied to specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 N in human nasal swabs.

Although huge efforts for drug repurposing and compound screens have been put forth  only a few compounds are in late-stage clinical trials. New approaches and assays are needed to accelerate COVID-19 drug discovery and development. Here  we report a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay that detects the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  nucleocapsid protein  NP  produced in infected cells. It uses two specific anti-NP monoclonal antibodies conjugated to donor and acceptor fluorophores that produce a robust ratiometric signal for high throughput screening of large compound collections. Using this assay  we measured a half maximal inhibitory concentration  IC 50   for remdesivir of 9.3 μM against infection with SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1 2020  WA-1 . The assay also detected SARS-CoV-2 South African  Beta  β   Brazilian Japanese P.1  Gamma  γ   and Californian  Epsilon  ε  variants of concern  VoC . Therefore  this homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 NP detection assay can be used for accelerating lead compound discovery for drug development and for evaluating drug efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC.

Our high-volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay  Variant PCR  in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al. STUDY DESIGN: : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1 screening  all positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing  WGS . RESULTS: : In total 1 642 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks. For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS  no VoC was missed by Variant PCR  totalling 399 VoC detected . Conversely  all of the samples identified as “other lineages”  i.e.  “non-VoC lineages”  by the Variant PCR  were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al.  is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC  applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of approximately 30 kb single-stranded RNA that is too large to analyze the whole genome by Sanger sequencing. Thus  in this study  we performed Sanger sequencing following long-range RT-PCR of the entire SARS-CoV-2 S-gene and analyzed the mutational dynamics. METHODS: The 4 kb region  including the S-gene  was amplified by two-step long-range RT-PCR. Then  the entire S-gene sequence was determined by Sanger sequencing. The amino acid mutations were identified as compared with the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome. RESULTS: The S:D614G mutation was found in all samples. The R.1 variants were detected after January 2021. Alpha variants started to emerge in April 2021. Delta variants replaced Alpha in July 2021. Then  Omicron variants were detected after December 2021. These mutational dynamics in samples collected in the Chiba University Hospital were similar to those in Japan. CONCLUSION: The emergence of variants of concern  VOC  has been reported by the entire S-gene analysis. As the VOCs have unique mutational patterns of the S-gene region  analysis of the entire S-gene will be useful for molecular surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories.

Objective Here we assessed SARS-CoV-2-S1-specific antibodies of BNT162b2  mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1 vaccinated as well as convalescent COVID-19 patients and furthermore determined the neutralization ability against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.1.7  Alpha   B1.1.7 E484K  Alpha E484K   B.1.351  Beta  and B.1.617.2  Delta  variants. Methods Serum samples of 107 fully vaccinated or convalescent individuals were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG and IgA as well as for total anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD Ig. Furthermore  neutralization capacity as NT50 and NT90 values against SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus and circulating variants were determined. Results We observed a robust IgG response in all participants  however the highest titers were detected in mRNA-based vaccine recipients. In case of serum IgA responses  the difference between mRNA- and vector-based vaccines or convalescent patients was even more pronounced. Interestingly  all three vaccines could neutralize all tested VOCs in addition to wild type virus  but in some individuals only low or no neutralization especially against Alpha-E484K and Delta variant was detected. Conclusion Critically  we here studied the efficacy of various COVID-19 vaccines and found that mRNA-1273 had the highest neutralization abilities compared to BNT162b2- and ChAdOx1 vaccinees. COVID-19 convalescent patients demonstrated the most heterogeneous range of antibody titers and neutralization ability  rendering assessment of protection difficult. Furthermore a significant  positive relation between antibodies and NT50 values for immunized and convalescent individuals was determined.

This led to the emergence of numerous variants  some of them recently being labeled “variants of concern”  VOC   due to their potential impact on transmission  morbidity mortality  and the evasion of neutralization by antibodies elicited by infection  vaccination  or therapeutic application. The potential to evade neutralization is the result of diversity of the target epitopes generated by the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein. While three globally recognized VOCs  Alpha or B.1.1.7  Beta or B.1.351  and Gamma or P.1  remain sensitive to neutralization albeit at reduced levels by the sera of convalescent individuals and recipients of several anti-COVID19 vaccines  the effect of spike variability is much more evident on the neutralization capacity of monoclonal antibodies. The newly recognized VOC Delta or lineage B.1.617.2  as well as locally accepted VOCs  Epsilon or B.1.427 29-US and B1.1.7 with the E484K-UK  are indicating the necessity of close monitoring of new variants on a global level. The VOCs characteristics  their mutational patterns  and the role mutations play in immune evasion are summarized in this review.

Since many people have been vaccinated with various types of vaccines  it is crucial to develop a high throughput platform for measuring the antibody responses and surrogate neutralizing activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. To meet this need  the present study developed a SARS-CoV-2 variant  CoVariant  array which consists of the extracellular domain of spike variants  e.g.  wild-type  D614G  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617  B.1.617.1  B.1.617.2  and B.1.617.3. A surrogate virus neutralization on the CoVariant array was established to quantify the bindings of antibody and host receptor ACE2 simultaneously to spike variants. By using a chimeric anti-spike antibody  we demonstrated a broad binding spectrum of antibodies while inhibiting the bindings of ACE2 to spike variants. To monitor the humoral immunities after vaccination  we collected serums from unvaccinated  partial  or fully vaccinated individuals with either mRNA-1273 or AZD1222  ChAdOx1 . The results showed partial vaccination increased the surrogate neutralization against all the mutants while full vaccination boosted the most. Although IgG  IgA  and IgM isotypes correlated with surrogate neutralizing activities  they behave differently throughout the vaccination processes. Overall  this study developed CoVariant arrays and assays for profiling the humoral responses which are useful for immune assessment  vaccine research  and drug development.

Recently  several variants such as B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   and P.1  gamma   which share a key mutation N501Y on the receptor-binding domain  RBD   appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism  we used a cell surface-binding assay  a kinetics study  a single-molecule technique  and a computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD  mutations  and ACE2. Remarkably  RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction  with a faster association rate and a slower dissociation rate. Atomic force microscopy  AFM -based single-molecule force microscopy  SMFS  consistently quantified the interaction strength of RBD with the mutation as having increased binding probability and requiring increased unbinding force. Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD–ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y mutation introduced additional π-π and π-cation interactions that could explain the changes observed by force microscopy. Taken together  these results suggest that the reinforced RBD–ACE2 interaction that results from the N501Y mutation in the RBD should play an essential role in the higher rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants  and that future mutations in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.

We recently reported expansion of broadly neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies in humans 8 months following a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S. Here  we assessed the 15-month durability of antibody responses and their neutralizing capacity to B.1.617.2  delta  and B.1.351  beta  variants following a single immunization of Ad26.COV2.S in mice. We report the persistence of binding and neutralizing antibody titers following immunization with a concomitant increase in neutralizing antibody breadth to delta and beta variants over time. Evaluation of bone marrow and spleen at 15 months postimmunization revealed that Ad26.COV2.S-immunized mice tissues contained spike-specific antibody-secreting cells. We conclude that immunization with Ad26.COV2.S elicits a robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 spike  which expands over time to neutralize delta and beta variants more robustly  and seeds bone marrow and spleen with long-lived spike-specific antibody-secreting cells. These data extend previous findings in humans and support the use of a mouse model as a potential tool to further explore the dynamics of the humoral immune response following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.

Our analysis showed that in the United Kingdom  case fatality ratio  CFR  decreased from May to July 2021 for non-Delta variant  whereas the decreasing trend of the CFR of Delta variant was weak and insignificant. The association between vaccine coverage and CFR appears stratified by different circulating variants. Due to the limitation of ecological study design  the interpretation of our results should be treated with caution.

Furthermore  numerous commercial assays with undisclosed primer and probe sequences are on the market. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses  the virus accrues mutations  which in some cases – as seen with the B.1.1.7 variant – can outperform and push back other strains of SARS-CoV-2. If mutations occur in primer or probe binding sites  this can impact RT-qPCR results and impede SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Here we tested the effect of primer mismatches on RT-qPCR performance in vitro using synthetic mismatch in vitro transcripts. The effects of the mismatches ranged from a shift in ct values from -0.13 to +7.61. Crucially  we found that a mismatch in the forward primer has a more detrimental effect for PCR performance than a mismatch in the reverse primer. Furthermore  we compared the performance of the original Charité RdRP primer set  which has several ambiguities  with a primer version without ambiguities and found that without ambiguities the ct values are ca. 3 ct lower. Finally  we investigated the shift in ct values observed with the Seegene Allplex kit with the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant and found a three-nucleotide mismatch in the forward primer of the N target.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter  double-blind  randomized  controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  AZD1222  in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×10 10  viral particles or placebo  0.9% sodium chloride solution  21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness  Covid-19  more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9  2020  we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults  median age  30 years ; 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine  respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis  mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients  3.2%  and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients  2.5%   for an efficacy of 21.9%  95% confidence interval [CI]  −49.9 to 59.8 . Among the 42 participants with Covid-19  39 cases  92.9%  were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant  analyzed as a secondary end point  was 10.4%  95% CI  −76.8 to 54.8 . The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

METHODS: The cluster was recognized in January 2021 with an epidemiological started from the hospitalization of a 68-year-old man suffering from coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  related pneumonia and we surprisingly found three families involved in the same cluster. RESULTS: We retrospectively rebuilt the pathway of infection and performed a virological analysis. CONCLUSION: This allow us to make clear the very high attack rate and the great infective capacity of this B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

It was reported that mortality increases by 65% and transmissibility increases by 70%  which may result in an increase of reproduction number to 1.13-1.55 from 0.75-0.85. To analyze the global increasing trend of the variant B.1.1.7  we extracted results of B.1.1.7 from GISAID on May 11 and May 12  2021  and conducted a dose-response regression. It took 47 days to reach 20% and 121 days to reach 50% among the sequence submitted from UK. In Korea  cases of B.1.1.7 have increased since the first report of three cases on December 28  2020. Positive rate of B.1.1.7 in Korea was 21.6% in the week from May 9 to May 15  2021. Detection rate of the variants is expected to increase further and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging  so a close monitoring and control would be maintained for months.

Here  we report an epidemiological and genomic investigation of a COVID-19 cluster consisting of seven healthcare workers  HCWs  at a quarantine facility and its partnered hospital in Thailand. Outbreak investigations were implemented to obtain contact tracing data and to establish chains of transmission. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with samples within the cohort was performed. Investigations of 951 HCWs and staff with quarantined travelers were implemented to determine the chain of transmission. Genomic and outbreak investigations identified the international travelers infected with the B.1.1.31 SARS-CoV-2 lineage as the source of this outbreak. The genomic data and the investigated timeline revealed a putative transmission chain among HCWs  pointing toward the transmission via the use of common living quarters at the investigated quarantine site. The evaluation of this cohort has led to a policy recommendation on quarantine facility management. International travel quarantine is an important strategy to contain importation of COVID-19 cases. However  a quarantine facility is likely to become a potential hotspot  requiring thorough preventive measures. Reducing the exposure risk by providing private living quarters and scheduling clinical duties at a quarantine site separated from the conventional healthcare workforce have been implemented.

Engineered angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  proteins with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein may prove to be especially efficacious against multiple variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays  we show that three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 protein markedly augmented the affinity for the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 2020 isolate and multiple VOCs: B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta .

This interspecies’ spill-over has triggered transmission in 58 patients epidemiologically linked to three pet shops. Incidentally  three dwarf hamsters imported from the Netherlands and centralized in a warehouse distributing animals to pet shops were positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike variant phylogenetically related to European B.1.258 strains from March 2020. This B.1.258 strain almost disappeared in July 2021. While no hamster-to-human transmission of B.1.258-like strain was found in this outbreak  molecular docking showed that its spike receptor-binding domain  RBD  has a similar binding energy to human ACE2 compared to that of Delta variant AY.127. Therefore  the potential of this B.1.258-related spike variant for interspecies jumping cannot be ignored. The co-circulation of B.1.258-related spike variants with Delta AY.127  which originated in Europe and was not previously found in Hong Kong  suggested that hamsters in our wholesale warehouse and retail pet shops more likely have acquired these viruses in the Netherlands or stopovers during delivery by aviation than locally. The risk of human-to-hamster reverse zoonosis by multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants leading to further adaptive spike mutations with subsequent transmission back to humans cannot be underestimated as an outbreak source of COVID-19. Testing imported pet animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 is warranted to prevent future outbreaks.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. Here we assessed the ability of T cells to react to Omicron spike protein in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2  or unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients  n = 70 . Between 70% and 80% of the CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover  the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar for Beta  B.1.351  and Delta  B.1.617.2  variants  despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. In patients who were hospitalized with Omicron infections  n = 19   there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike  nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those in patients hospitalized in previous waves dominated by the ancestral  Beta or Delta variants  n = 49 . Thus  despite extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies of Omicron  the majority of T cell responses induced by vaccination or infection cross-recognize the variant. It remains to be determined whether well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron contributes to protection from severe COVID-19 and is linked to early clinical observations from South Africa and elsewhere 9–12 .

Ad26.COV2.S-Elicted Neutralizing Activities Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in Phase 1 2a and Phase 3 Clinical Trials,BACKGROUND: In a Phase 3 trial  the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine  Ad26.COV2.S  showed robust efficacy against severe–critical COVID-19 in countries where different SARS-CoV-2 variants were circulating. We evaluated Ad26.COV2.S-elicited antibody neutralizing activity against variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   and B.1.617.2  Delta  in sera from participants in clinical trials following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. METHODS: Neutralizing activities of Ad26.COV2.S  given at a dose level of 5 x 10 10  viral particles [vp]  against VOC were assessed by wild-type virus neutralizing  wtVNA  and pseudovirion neutralization  psVNA  assays in sera from participants in Phase 1 2a and Phase 3 clinical trials  respectively. Geometric mean titers  GMTs  were determined at Days 29 and 71 after vaccination. RESULTS: In serum samples from Phase 1 2a participants  n = 6   at Day 29 after 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S  wtVNA titers against VOC were lower than for the original strain  GMT = 573   with GMT = 65  14  and 15 for Alpha  Beta  and Delta  respectively  representing 8.8-  40.9-  and 37.7-fold decreases. By Day 71 after vaccination  n = 14   fold differences between the original strain  GMT = 375  and VOC  GMT = 113  27  and 28  were smaller  3.3-  13.9-  and 13.4-fold  than at Day 29  suggestive of B-cell maturation  Figure 1 . Day 71 titers against the Delta variant were maintained for at least 8 months following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S  5 x 10 10  vp . In serum samples from Phase 3 participants  n = 8   psVNA titers against VOC were lower than the original strain at Day 71 after vaccination  with the lowest titers observed for the Beta variant  3.6-fold decrease vs original strain . Smaller reductions in Nab titers for VOC were observed in the psVNA assay compared to wtVNA. Figure 1. Neutralization of B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   and B.1.617.2  Delta  lineages in serum samples from participants who received Ad26.COV2.S. n = 6 samples at Day 29 and n = 14  n = 14 for Alpha and Beta; n = 6 for Delta  comprising the same 6 participants at Day 29  samples at Day 71 after vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S  5 x 10^10 vp dose level  were analyzed in wild-type virus neutralization assays against the SARS-CoV-2 Victoria strain  D614  black dots   the B.1.1.7  Alpha; green dots  the B.1.351  Beta; blue dots   and the B.1.617.2  Delta; purple dots  lineages. Dots represent the IC50  inhibitory concentration  titers per participant. Geometric mean titers  GMTs  and fold decrease in neutralizing activity between the original Victoria strain and each lineage are shown. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Ad26.COV2.S-elicited serum neutralizing activity against VOC showed an overall decrease in titers relative to the original strain that was largest for the Beta variant  even though vaccine efficacy against severe–critical COVID-19 was maintained in countries where these variants were circulating versus in countries where they were not circulating. Over time  titers against variants increased  suggesting B-cell affinity maturation leading to increasing coverage of VOC.

Here  we initially evaluated the neutralization capabilities in vitro by serum neutralization  SN  of six serum samples collected from recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine against 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolates belonging to the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages that had been circulating in Italy. Then  we considered 30 additional serum samples by SN assay against the dominant B.1.617.2  Delta  variant. A B.1 lineage isolate was used as a reference. In the first analysis  significant differences when compared with the reference strain  p > 0.05  were not evidenced; instead  when the panel of 30 sera was tested against the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  a significant  p = 0.0015  2.38-fold reduction in neutralizing titres compared with the reference after the first vaccine dose was demonstrated. After the second vaccine dose  the reduction was not significant  p = 0.1835 . This study highlights that the BNT162b2 vaccine stimulates a humoral response able to neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants  thus suggesting a prominent role in mitigating the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in real-world conditions. Long-term follow-up is currently ongoing.

Adjuvants that enhance and shape adaptive immune responses that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants will be pivotal for long-term protection as drift variants continue to emerge. We developed an intranasal  rationally designed adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion  NE  that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I  IVT DI . The combination adjuvant with spike protein antigen elicited robust responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice  with markedly enhanced T H 1-biased cellular responses and high virus-neutralizing antibody titers towards both homologous SARS-CoV-2 and a variant harboring the N501Y mutation shared by B1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Furthermore  passive transfer of vaccination-induced antibodies protected naive mice against heterologous viral challenge. NE IVT DI enables mucosal vaccination  and has the potential to improve the immune profile of a variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates to provide effective cross-protection against future drift variants.

RESULTS: The Delta surge in Putian spread from children in schools to factories  mostly through family contact. Compared with those aged ≥ 12y  patients aged < 12y accounted for 34.07% of the total and showed milder fever  less cough and fatigue; they reported higher peripheral blood lymphocyte counts [1.84  1.32  2.71 ×10^9 L vs. 1.31  0.94  1.85 ×10^9 L; p<0.05   higher normal CRP rate  92.21% vs. 57.72%   lower IL-6 levels [5.28  3.31  8.13  vs. 9.10  4.37  15.14 ; p<0.05]. Upon admission  their COVID19 antibodies  IgM and IgG  and IgG in convalescence were lower [0.13  0.00  0.09  vs. 0.12  0.03  0.41   p<0.05; 0.02  0.00  0.14  vs. 1.94  0.54  6.40   p<0.05; 5.46  2.41  9.26  vs. 73.63  54.63  86.55   p<0.05  respectively]  but longer NAN time  18 days vs. 16 days  p=0.13 . CONCLUSION: Unvaccinated children may be an important link in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  B1.617.2   which indicated an urgent need of vaccination for this particular population.

Understanding the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for delivering public health intervention as certain variants may have different attributes that can potentially affect their transmissibility  as well as the performance of diagnostics  vaccines  and therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the dynamics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants over a 15-month period in Bogor and its surrounding areas in correlation with the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Indonesia. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples collected from suspected patients from Bogor  Jakarta and Tangerang were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR. RNA samples of those confirmed patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the ARTIC Network protocol and sequencer platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies  ONT . RESULTS: We successfully identified 16 lineages and six clades out of 202 samples  male n = 116  female n = 86 . Genome analysis revealed that Indonesian lineage B.1.466.2 dominated during the first wave  n = 48  23.8%  while Delta variants  AY.23  AY.24  AY.39  AY.42  AY.43 dan AY.79  were dominant during the second wave  n = 53  26.2%  following the highest number of confirmed cases in Indonesia. In the spike protein gene  S_D614G and S_P681R changes were dominant in both B.1.466.2 and Delta variants  while N439K was only observed in B.1.466.2  n = 44  and B.1.470  n = 1 . Additionally  the S_T19R  S_E156G  S_F157del  S_R158del  S_L452R  S_T478K  S_D950N and S_V1264L changes were only detected in Delta variants  consistent with those changes being characteristic of Delta variants in general. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a shift in SARS-CoV-2 variants from the first wave of COVID-19 to Delta variants in the second wave  during which the number of confirmed cases surpassed those in the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Higher proportion of unique mutations detected in Delta variants compared to the first wave variants indicated potential mutational effects on viral transmissibility that correlated with a higher incidence of confirmed cases. Genomic surveillance of circulating variants  especially those with higher transmissibility  should be continuously conducted to rapidly inform decision making and support outbreak preparedness  prevention  and public health response.

Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However  the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  UK   B.1.351  South Africa  and P.1  Brazil  harbor mutations in the viral spike  S  protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here  using pseudoparticles  we show that entry of all variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble ACE2  Camostat  EK-1 and EK-1-C4. In contrast  entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was partially  Casirivimab  or fully  Bamlanivimab  resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover  entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses  which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.

Of great concern is its high number of mutations  including 30–40 mutations in the virus spike  S  protein compared to 7–10 for other variants. Some of these mutations have been shown to enhance escape from vaccine-induced immunity  while others remain uncharacterized. Additionally  reports of increasing frequencies of the Omicron variant may indicate a higher rate of transmission compared to other variants. However  the transmissibility of Omicron and its degree of resistance to vaccine-induced immunity remain unclear. Here we show that Omicron exhibits significant immune evasion compared to other variants  but antibody neutralization is largely restored by mRNA vaccine booster doses. Additionally  the Omicron spike exhibits reduced receptor binding  cell-cell fusion  S1 subunit shedding  but increased cell-to-cell transmission  and homology modeling indicates a more stable closed S structure. These findings suggest dual immune evasion strategies for Omicron  due to altered epitopes and reduced exposure of the S receptor binding domain  coupled with enhanced transmissibility due to enhanced S protein stability. These results highlight the importance of booster vaccine doses for maintaining protection against the Omicron variant  and provide mechanistic insight into the altered functionality of the Omicron spike protein.

We have previously established a technology platform for rapidly preparing SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  candidate vaccines based on glycoengineered Pichia pastoris. Our previous study revealed that the wild-type RBD  WT-RBD  formulated with aluminum hydroxide and CpG 2006 adjuvant effectively induces neutralizing antibodies in BALB c mice. In the present study  a glycoengineered P. pastoris expression system was used to prepare recombinant kappa-RBD candidate vaccine. Kappa-RBD formulated with CpG and alum induced BALB c mice to produce a potent antigen-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibody titers against pseudoviruses of SARS-CoV-2 kappa  delta  lambda  beta  and omicron variants and WT. Therefore  the recombinant kappa-RBD vaccine has sufficient potency to be a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Since SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  was first detected on the island in March of 2020  it spread rapidly though the island’s population and became a critical threat to public health. We conducted a genomic surveillance study through a partnership with health agencies and academic institutions to understand the emergence and molecular epidemiology of the virus on the island. We sampled COVID-19 cases monthly over 19 months and sequenced a total of 753 SARS-CoV-2 genomes between March 2020 and September 2021 to reconstruct the local epidemic in a regional context using phylogenetic inference. Our analyses revealed that multiple importation events propelled the emergence and spread of the virus throughout the study period  including the introduction and spread of most SARS-CoV-2 variants detected world-wide. Lineage turnover cycles through various phases of the local epidemic were observed  where the predominant lineage was replaced by the next competing lineage or variant after approximately 4 months of circulation locally. We also identified the emergence of lineage B.1.588  an autochthonous lineage that predominated circulation in Puerto Rico from September to December 2020 and subsequently spread to the United States. The results of this collaborative approach highlight the importance of timely collection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data to inform public health responses.

The aim of this study is to describe how mass testing and phylogenetic analysis successfully prevented local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 VOC in a densely populated city with low herd immunity for COVID-19. METHODS: In this descriptive study  we conducted contact tracing  quarantine  and mass testing of the potentially exposed contacts with the index case. Epidemiological investigation and phylogeographic analysis were performed. FINDINGS: Among 11 818 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed till 13 th  May 2021 in Hong Kong  SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were found in 271  2.3%  cases. Except for 10 locally acquired secondary cases  all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were imported or acquired in quarantine hotels. The index case of this SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.351 epidemic  an inbound traveler with asymptomatic infection  was diagnosed 9 days after completing 21 days of quarantine. Contact tracing of 163 contacts in household  hotel  and residential building only revealed 1  0.6%  secondary case. A symptomatic foreign domestic helper  FDH  without apparent epidemiological link but infected by virus with identical genome sequence was subsequently confirmed. Mass testing of 0.34 million FDHs identified two more cases which were phylogenetically linked. A total of 10 secondary cases were identified that were related to two household gatherings. The clinical attack rate of household close contact was significantly higher than non-household exposure during quarantine  7 25  28% vs 0 2051  0%; p<0.001 . INTERPRETATION: The rising epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 VOC transmission could be successfully controlled by contact tracing  quarantine  and rapid genome sequencing complemented by mass testing.

We evaluated whether a spike ferritin nanoparticle vaccine  SpFN   adjuvanted with the Army Liposomal Formulation QS21  ALFQ   conferred protection against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs in Syrian golden hamsters. SpFN-ALFQ was administered as either single or double-vaccination  0 and 4 week  regimens  using a high  10 μg  or low  0.2 μg  immunogen dose. Animals were intranasally challenged at week 11. Binding antibody responses were comparable between high- and low-dose groups. Neutralizing antibody titers were equivalent against WA1  B.1.1.7  and B.1.351 variants following two high dose two vaccinations. SpFN-ALFQ vaccination protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced disease and viral replication following intranasal B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 challenge  as evidenced by reduced weight loss  lung pathology  and lung and nasal turbinate viral burden. These data support the development of SpFN-ALFQ as a broadly protective  next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Among them  2 195 130 cases and 63 965 deaths occurred in Sao Paulo State  Southeast Brazil. The recent emergence and rise of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 is of concern because of their higher transmissibility and possible association with more severe disease. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections have been described since December 2020 in Brazil. This report describes two cases of COVID-19 reinfection  that occurred five and six months after the first infection  during the second wave of the pandemic in Sao Paulo State. Both patients presented mild symptoms in the two COVID-19 episodes and different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified: B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 lineages in case 1 and B1.1.128 and P. 2 lineages in case 2.

We report a patient had two distinct episodes of COVID-19 with different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The nasopharyngeal samples collected from the two episodes were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis. Results: The first infection presented with mild symptoms  while the second infection presented with severe outcomes which occurred 74 days after the patient recovered from the first episode. He had elevated C-reactive protein  ferritin  and bilateral consolidation as a sign of acute infection. Genome analysis revealed that the strains from the first and second episodes belonged to two distinct Nexstrain clades 20B and 20I and Pangolin lineages B.1.1.25 and B.1.1.7  respectively. A total of 36 mutations were observed in the episode-2 strain when compared with the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1. Among them  eight mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain  RBD . Conclusion: Our findings concern whether the immunity acquired by natural infection or mass vaccination could confer adequate protection against the constantly evolving SARS-CoV-2. Therefore  continuous monitoring of genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 strains is crucial for interventions such as vaccine and drug designs  treatment using monoclonal antibodies  and patient management.

Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in a community is pivotal for appropriate public health response. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples for tracking variants is challenging  often resulting in low coverage genome sequences  thereby impeding the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Therefore  we aimed at high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from sewage samples which we successfully accomplished. This first pan-European surveillance compared the mutation profiles associated with the variants of concerns: B.1.1.7  P.1  B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 across 20 European countries  including 54 municipalities. The results highlight that SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in the wastewater samples mirror the variants profiles reported in clinical data. This study demonstrated that >98% coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences is possible and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater to support identifying variants circulating in a city at the community level.

They are found in many mammals and birds and have great importance for the health of humans and farm animals. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  as well as many previous epidemics in humans that were of zoonotic origin  highlights the importance of studying the evolution of the entire CoV subfamily in order to understand how novel strains emerge and which molecular processes affect their adaptation  transmissibility  host tissue tropism  and patho non-homologous genicity. In this review  we focus on studies over the last two years that reveal the impact of point mutations  insertions deletions  and intratypic intertypic homologous and non-homologous recombination events on the evolution of CoVs. We discuss whether the next generations of CoV vaccines should be directed against other CoV proteins in addition to or instead of spike. Based on the observed patterns of molecular evolution for the entire subfamily  we discuss five scenarios for the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally  within this evolutionary context  we discuss the recently emerged Omicron  B.1.1.529  VoC.

The neutralising ability of different vaccines alone or with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron is not well-known. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study  we tested the ability of vaccine and natural infection induced antibodies to neutralise omicron variant in a live virus neutralisation assay in four groups of individuals:  i  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination   ii  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection   iii  vaccination with inactivated virus vaccine  BBV152   and  iv  BBV152 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcome was fold-change in virus neutralisation titre against omicron compared with ancestral virus. FINDINGS: We included 80 subjects. The geometric mean titre  GMT  of the 50% focus reduction neutralisation test  FRNT50  was 380·4  95% CI: 221·1  654·7  against the ancestral virus with BBV152 vaccination and 379·3  95% CI: 185·6  775·2  with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination alone. GMT for vaccination plus infection groups were 806·1  95% CI: 478·5  1357·8  and 1526·2  95% CI: 853·2  2730·0   respectively. Against omicron variant  only 5 out of 20 in both BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only groups  6 out of 20 in BBV152 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group  and 9 out of 20 in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group exhibited neutralisation titres above the lower limit of quantification  1:20  suggesting better neutralisation with prior infection. A reduction of 26·6 and 25·7 fold in FRNT50 titres against Omicron compared to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed for individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccinated with BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  respectively. The corresponding reduction was 57·1 and 58·1 fold  respectively  for vaccinated individuals with prior infection. The 50% neutralisation titre against omicron demonstrated moderate correlation with serum anti-RBD IgG levels [Spearman r: 0·58  0·41  0·71 ]. INTERPRETATION: Significant reduction in the neutralising ability of both vaccine-induced and vaccine plus infection-induced antibodies was observed for omicron variant which might explain immune escape.

METHODS: Haematological parameters measured during the first 4 days after admission were subjected to a linear mixed model to obtain patient-specific intercepts and slopes for each parameter. A prediction model was built using logistic regression with variable selection and shrinkage factor estimation supported by bootstrapping. Model development was based on 481 survivors and 97 non-survivors  hospitalized before the occurrence of mutations. Internal validation was done by 10-fold cross-validation. The model was temporally-externally validated in 299 survivors and 42 non-survivors hospitalized when the Alpha variant  B.1.1.7  was prevalent. RESULTS: The final model included age  fever on admission as well as the slope or intercept of lactate dehydrogenase  platelet count  C-reactive protein  and creatinine. Tenfold cross validation resulted in a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  AUROC  of 0.92  a mean calibration slope of 1.0023 and a Brier score of 0.076. At temporal-external validation  application of the previously developed model showed an AUROC of 0.88  a calibration slope of 0.95 and a Brier score of 0.073. Regarding the relative importance of the variables  the  apparent  variation in mortality explained by the six variables deduced from the haematological parameters measured during the first four days is higher  explained variation 0.295  than that of age  0.210 . CONCLUSIONS: The presented model requires only variables routinely acquired in hospitals  which allows immediate and wide-spread use as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system.

Trained interviewers collected data from residents  staff  and administration officers with an agreed informed consent procedure. Thirty-two  44.5%  out of 72 residents  median age 89 years  and six  26.1%  of 23 healthcare workers were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infections occurred more often among residents with a higher index of independence in daily living activities  suggesting an increased risk for those with more interactions. Twenty-five infected residents  78.1%  received the booster dose of mRNA anti-COVID-19 vaccine > 7 days before SARS-CoV-2 onset. Half of the infected residents had mild symptoms  and only three required hospitalisation  one of whom died from COVID-19 complications. The study underlines the effectiveness of a booster dose in providing a high protection against severe disease and hospitalisation even among vulnerable individuals infected with the Delta variant of concern.

By using next-generation sequencing reads intersecting regions that simultaneously overlap lineage-defining mutations from Gamma and Delta  we were able to identify a total of six recombinant regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome within a sample. Four of them mapped in the spike gene and two in the nucleocapsid gene. We detected mosaic reads harboring a combination of lineage-defining mutations from each VOC. To our knowledge  this is the first report of intra-host RNA-RNA recombination between two lineages of SARS-CoV-2  which can represent a threat to public health management during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the possibility of the emergence of viruses with recombinant phenotypes.

Following rapid distribution and administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna  under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration  2   observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness  VE  ranging from 53% to 92% against SARS-CoV-2 infection  3-6 . However  concerns about the potential for waning vaccine-induced immunity and the recent emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant† highlight the need to continue to monitor VE  7 . Weekly data reported by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare  CMS -certified skilled nursing facilities or nursing homes to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network  NHSN § were analyzed to evaluate effectiveness of full vaccination  2 doses received ≥14 days earlier  with any of the two currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the period soon after vaccine introduction and before the Delta variant was circulating  pre-Delta [March 1-May 9  2021]   and when the Delta variant predominated¶  Delta [June 21-August 1  2021] . Using 17 407 weekly reports from 3 862 facilities from the pre-Delta period  adjusted effectiveness against infection for any mRNA vaccine was 74.7%  95% confidence interval [CI] = 70.0%-78.8% . Analysis using 33 160 weekly reports from 11 581 facilities during an intermediate period  May 10-June 20  found that the adjusted effectiveness was 67.5%  95% CI = 60.1%-73.5% . Analysis using 85 593 weekly reports from 14 917 facilities during the Delta period found that the adjusted effectiveness was 53.1%  95% CI = 49.1%-56.7% . Effectiveness estimates were similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These findings indicate that mRNA vaccines provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents; however  VE was lower after the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. This analysis assessed VE against any infection  without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations. Additional evaluations are needed to understand protection against severe disease in nursing home residents over time. Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination  multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies  including infection control  testing  and vaccination of nursing home staff members  residents  and visitors  are critical. An additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents to optimize a protective immune response.

The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became globally dominant  and the currently available COVID-19 vaccines showed less protection against this variant. This study aimed to investigate healthcare workers’  HCWs  knowledge and perceptions about the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. A cross-sectional anonymous electronic survey concerning the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was conducted among HCWs during the second week of January 2022. The survey instrument was distributed through social media among HCWs to explore awareness  2 items   knowledge  10 items   source of information  1 item   and perceptions  10 items . Respondents who answered ≥80% of the items correctly were considered as having good knowledge and perception. A total of 940 of the 1054 HCW participants completed the survey  response rate: 89.1% ; they had a mean age of 31.2 ± 11.2 years  most were doctors  45.7%   and most were from Asia  64.3% . All the participants were aware of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant  100% . Only 36.3% attended lectures discussions about Omicron and used news media to obtain information. Only a quarter of the HCWs demonstrated good knowledge  24.3%  n = 228  and perception  20.6%  about Omicron. However  while significant differences were observed in the knowledge and perception among HCWs  only a small proportion of doctors exhibited good knowledge  13%  and perception  10%  about the Omicron variant. HCWs who had participated in training discussion related to the Omicron variant were more likely to have higher knowledge and perception scores  odds ratio: 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.04–3.11 . As the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant spreads rapidly across the globe  ongoing educational interventions are warranted to improve knowledge and perceptions of HCWs.

Mass vaccination efforts using the highly effective vaccines are currently underway to generate sufficient herd immunity and reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite the most advanced vaccine technology  global recipient coverage  especially in resource-poor areas remains a challenge as genetic drift in naïve population pockets threatens overall vaccine efficacy. In this study  we described the production of insect-cell expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain constructs and examined their immunogenicity in mice. We demonstrated that  when formulated with CoVaccine HT TM  adjuvant  an oil-in-water nanoemulsion compatible with lyophilization  our vaccine candidates elicit a broad-spectrum IgG response  high neutralizing antibody  NtAb  titers against SARS-CoV-2 prototype and variants of concern  specifically B.1.351  Beta  and P.1.  Gamma   and an antigen-specific IFN-γ secreting response in outbred mice. Of note  different ectodomain constructs yielded variations in NtAb titers against the prototype strain and some VOC. Dose response experiments indicated that NtAb titers increased with antigen dose  but not adjuvant dose  and may be higher with a lower adjuvant dose. Our findings lay the immunological foundation for the development of a dry-thermostabilized vaccine that is deployable without refrigeration.

Not much is known about the symptoms  courses of disease  and infectiousness in pediatric patients with the Alpha variant. Objective: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to gain information on the infection with the Alpha variant in children and adolescents. Methods: Between 12 January 2021 and 3 June 2021  all nucleic acid amplification tests  NAATs  of children who received a swab for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Data were collected on standardized questionnaires. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Results: We investigated 3544 NAATs; 95 children were tested positive  2.7%  for SARS-CoV-2. For the sub-analysis  65 children were analyzed. In 59 children  the Alpha variant was found  90.8%   and 54.2%  n = 32 59  were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever  cough  and rhinitis. The median Ct value was 24.0  min 17.0; max 32.7 . Conclusions: We can underline early findings that children are still less effected by SARS-CoV-2 infection with the spread of the Alpha variant. We found no evidence that children infected with the Alpha variant showed more severe symptoms or suffered from a more severe clinical course than those infected with the wild type.

However  their common genetic and biologic features remain elusive. Here we interrogate a total of 165 antibodies from eight COVID-19 patients  and find that potent nAbs from different patients have disproportionally high representation of IGHV3-53 3-66 usage  and therefore termed as public antibodies. Crystal structural comparison of these antibodies reveals they share similar angle of approach to RBD  overlap in buried surface and binding residues on RBD  and have substantial spatial clash with receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  ACE2  in binding to RBD. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms these common binding features although some minor differences are found. One representative antibody  P5A-3C8  demonstrates extraordinarily protective efficacy in a golden Syrian hamster model against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However  virus escape analysis identifies a single natural mutation in RBD  namely K417N found in B.1.351 variant from South Africa  abolished the neutralizing activity of these public antibodies. The discovery of public antibodies and shared escape mutation highlight the intricate relationship between antibody response and SARS-CoV-2  and provide critical reference for the development of antibody and vaccine strategies to overcome the antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2.

Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates  the SARS-related coronavirus  SARSr-CoV   including the SARS-CoV are closely related  yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2  in particular  bats  avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts  owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever  dry cough  fatigue  dyspnoea and headache  very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2  SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions  bilateral ground-glass opacities  and segmental consolidation in the lungs  a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus  the SARS-CoV  it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit  exhibit greater stability  bypass innate host defences  and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2  highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses  including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.

Evaluation of the Anti-Spike IgG titers 28 weeks after the mRNA vaccine boosts against SARS-COV-2 infection and severe Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A timely collection of sera within 48h from the index case; anti-Spike IgG determination  expressed as Binding Antibody Units – BAU mL  through a commercial quantitative assay; SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics via RT-PCR  and full-genome sequencing for lineage characterization. Residents were grouped according to anti-Spike IgG titers  ≤50  51-1000  and > 1000 BAU mL  and resulting protection against the infection and the severe disease was measured. RESULTS: 0 20 HWs and 14 59  24%  residents fully vaccinated and without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection showed anti-Spike IgG ≤50 BAU mL  1-sided Fisher exact p=0.011 . Among these residents  a level of anti-Spike IgG ≤50 BAU mL resulted in a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection  RR=1.55  CI95% 1.17-2.05  and severe Covid-19 disease  RR=5.33  CI95% 1.83-15.57 . CONCLUSION: Low levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-Spike IgG in serum 28 weeks after the administration of the second dose parallels the waning of vaccine protection.

A major concern is whether the available vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 7 8   which is required for viral entry to host cells 9 . Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody production  while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed  characterized  and implemented two standardized  functional assays to measure T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected  convalescent  and vaccinated individuals. We found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and nucleocapsid proteins  even more so than convalescent patients. We also found detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.1.248  among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody neutralization have also been observed with some variants 10–12   investigation into the T-cell response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative. Standardized measurements of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are feasible and can be easily adjusted to determine changes in response to variants.

The Northern region has the second highest incidence coefficient  as well as the third highest mortality rate in the country. This study aimed to investigate information about the evolutionary history of epidemic spread and genetic aspects of strains isolated on the Western Amazon  in the State of Rondônia  Brazil. It was possible to detect a total of 22 mutations. Some of these alterations may possibly be related to effects on transmissibility  the fidelity of RNA replication  the ability of cancer patients to respond to infection  beyond a mutation that emerged after the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Rondônia. At least two events of introduction were detected  corresponding to the B.1 and B.1.1 European lineages. An introduction was observed possibly through Argentina  where strains originated that circulated in the Minas Gerais and Ceará Brazilian states  prior to Rondônia  B.1.   as well as through the Minas Gerais state and the Federal District  which gave rise to strains that spread to Rondônia  from the capital to more rural parts of the state  B.1.1. . The findings show the need to monitor the genetic epidemiology of COVID-19  in order to surveil the virus’s evolution  dispersion and diversity.

We monitored SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in school-aged children and compared them with adult infection rates before and after schools reopened in England. METHODS: Public Health England receives daily electronic reports of all SARS-CoV-2 tests nationally. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates by school year from July to December 2020 were analysed  including the effect of a national month-long lockdown whilst keeping schools open in November 2020 RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infections rates were low during early summer but started increasing in mid-August  initially in young adults followed by secondary and then primary school-aged children prior to schools reopening in September 2020. Cases in school-aged children lagged behind and followed adult trends after schools reopened  with a strong age gradient in weekly infection rates. There was a strong  P<0.001  correlation in regional infection rates between adults and secondary  R 2 =0.96-0.98   primary  R 2 =0.93-0.94  and preschool-aged  R 2 =0.62-0.85  children. The November lockdown was associated with declines in adult infection rates  followed a week later  by declines in student cases. From 23 November 2020  cases in adults and children increased rapidly following the emergence of a more transmissible novel variant of concern  VUI-202012 01; VOC B.1.1.7 . CONCLUSIONS: In school-aged children  SARS-CoV-2 infections followed the same trajectory as adult cases and only declined after national lockdown was implemented whilst keeping schools open. Maintaining low community infection rates is critical for keeping schools open during the pandemic.

Extraction-free RT-PCR to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.149,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.149,,pmc:PMC8644938,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,149. Extraction-free RT-PCR to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC  have challenged real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus real-time RT-PCR panel was modified to create a single-plex extraction-free proxy RT-PCR assay  VOCFast™. This assay uses the nucleocapsid N1 as well as novel primer probe pairs to target VOC mutations in the Orf1a and spike  S  genes. For analytical validation of VOCFast  synthetic controls for the Wuhan  alpha B.1.1.7  beta B.1.351  and gamma P.1 strains were tested at various concentrations. Clinical validation was performed using patient anterior nares swab and saliva specimens collected in the Denver  CO area between Nov 2020 and Feb 2021 or in March 2021. Orthogonal next-generation sequencing  NGS  was also performed. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: Similar N1 quantification cycle  Cq  values corresponding to viral load were observed for all strains  suggesting that VOC mutations do not affect performance of the N1 primer probe. Orf1a-mut and S1-mut primer probes generated a stable high Cq value for the Wuhan strain. Conversely  Orf1a-mut Cq values were inversely correlated with viral load for all VOC. The S1-mut Cq was inversely correlated with viral load of the alpha strain  but did not reliably amplify beta gamma VOC. The limit of detection was 8 copies uL. The first set of COVID-19 patient specimens revealed no amplification using Orf1a-mut whereas 53% of specimens collected in Mar 2021 demonstrated amplification by Orf-1a. Orthogonal testing by the SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay and COVID-DX software demonstrated that 12 12 alpha strains  2 2 beta gamma strains  and 33 33 Wuhan strains were correctly identified by VOCFast. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] Detection of VOC in clinical specimens and validation by NGS [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The combination of the N1  Orf1a-mut  and S1-mut primers probes in VOCFast can distinguish the Wuhan  alpha  and beta gamma strains and it consistent with NGS results. Testing of clinical samples revealed that VOC emerged in Denver  CO in March 2021. Future work to discriminate beta  gamma  and emerging VOC is ongoing. In summary  VOCFast is an extraction-free RT-PCR assay for nasal swab and saliva specimens that can identify VOC with a turnaround time suitable for clinical testing.

The persistence of BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech  vaccine effectiveness against infection and disease in Qatar  where the B.1.351  or beta  and B.1.617.2  or delta  variants have dominated incidence and polymerase-chain-reaction testing is done on a mass scale  is unclear. METHODS: We used a matched test-negative  case–control study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe  critical  or fatal case of Covid-19  from January 1 to September 5  2021. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was negligible in the first 2 weeks after the first dose. It increased to 36.8%  95% confidence interval [CI]  33.2 to 40.2  in the third week after the first dose and reached its peak at 77.5%  95% CI  76.4 to 78.6  in the first month after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter  with the decline accelerating after the fourth month to reach approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than effectiveness against asymptomatic infection but waned similarly. Variant-specific effectiveness waned in the same pattern. Effectiveness against any severe  critical  or fatal case of Covid-19 increased rapidly to 66.1%  95% CI  56.8 to 73.5  by the third week after the first dose and reached 96% or higher in the first 2 months after the second dose; effectiveness persisted at approximately this level for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to wane rapidly following its peak after the second dose  but protection against hospitalization and death persisted at a robust level for 6 months after the second dose.

The same three positions in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  are affected in both variants  but where the 417 substitution differs  the E484K N501Y have co-evolved by convergent evolution. Here we characterize the functional and immune evasive consequences of the P.1 and B.1.351 RBD mutations. E484K and N501Y result in gain-of-function with two different outcomes: The N501Y confers a ten-fold affinity increase towards ACE-2  but a modest antibody evasion potential of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals  whereas the E484K displays a significant antibody evasion capacity without a major impact on affinity. On the other hand  the two different 417 substitutions severely impair the RBD ACE-2 affinity  but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants  this effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y. Our results suggest that the combination of these three mutations is a two-step forward and one step back in terms of viral fitness.

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations  evolution  and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here  we analyzed 454 443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes proteins and 14 427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae  Mustelidae or Felidae  especially the Canidae family  for example  dog  could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably  the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations. In addition  we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t  5′UTR_c241t  and NSP3_c3037t into the viral genome  and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication. Our experimental results demonstrated that the co-mutations significantly attenuated the viral replication. The study provides valuable clues for discovering the transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 and understanding the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2.

Here we report the humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  such as 501Y.V2  B.1.351   of the plasma and neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  elicited by CoronaVac  inactivated vaccine   ZF2001  RBD-subunit vaccine  and natural infection. Among 86 potent NAbs identified by high-throughput single-cell VDJ sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees and convalescents  near half anti-RBD NAbs showed major neutralization reductions against the K417N E484K N501Y mutation combination  with E484K being the dominant cause. VH3-53 VH3-66 recurrent antibodies respond differently to RBD variants  and K417N compromises the majority of neutralizing activity through reduced polar contacts with complementarity determining regions. In contrast  the 242–244 deletion  242–244Δ  would abolish most neutralization activity of anti-NTD NAbs by interrupting the conformation of NTD antigenic supersite  indicating a much less diversity of anti-NTD NAbs than anti-RBD NAbs. Plasma of convalescents and CoronaVac vaccinees displayed comparable neutralization reductions against pseudo- and authentic 501Y.V2 variants  mainly caused by E484K N501Y and 242–244Δ  with the effects being additive. Importantly  RBD-subunit vaccinees exhibit markedly higher tolerance to 501Y.V2 than convalescents  since the elicited anti-RBD NAbs display a high diversity and are unaffected by NTD mutations. Moreover  an extended gap between the third and second doses of ZF2001 leads to better neutralizing activity and tolerance to 501Y.V2 than the standard three-dose administration. Together  these results suggest that the deployment of RBD-vaccines  through a third-dose boost  may be ideal for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants when necessary  especially for those carrying mutations that disrupt the NTD supersite.

The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS: We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain  B.1.1.7  or alpha variant  over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike  S  gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients’ vaccination status. RESULTS: Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine  BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  was notably lower among persons with the delta variant  30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]  25.2 to 35.7  than among those with the alpha variant  48.7%; 95% CI  45.5 to 51.7 ; the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine  the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7%  95% CI  91.6 to 95.3  among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0%  95% CI  85.3 to 90.1  among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5%  95% CI  68.4 to 79.4  among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0%  95% CI  61.3 to 71.8  among those with the delta variant. CONCLUSIONS: Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations.  Funded by Public Health England.

In this study  we analyzed surface stability and disinfection of the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 compared to the wild type. Treatment with heat  soap and ethanol revealed similar inactivation profiles indicative of a comparable susceptibility towards disinfection. Furthermore  we observed comparable surface stability on steel  silver  copper and face masks. Overall  our data support the application of currently recommended hygiene concepts to minimize the risk of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 transmission.

Cocktail therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of viral infection. Herein  we reported the potent preclinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of a cocktail therapy consisting of clinically used drugs  e.g. colloidal bismuth subcitrate  CBS  or bismuth subsalicylate  BSS   and N-acetyl-l-cysteine  NAC . Oral administration of the cocktail reduced viral loads in the lung and ameliorated virus-induced pneumonia in a hamster infection model. The mechanistic studies showed that NAC prevented the hydrolysis of bismuth drugs at gastric pH via the formation of the stable component [Bi NAC  3 ]  and optimized the pharmacokinetics profile of CBS in vivo. Combination of bismuth drugs with NAC suppressed the replication of a panel of medically important coronaviruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus  MERS-CoV   Human coronavirus 229E  HCoV-229E  and SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant  B.1.1.7  with broad-spectrum inhibitory activities towards key viral cysteine enzymes proteases including papain-like protease  PL pro    main protease  M pro    helicase  Hel  and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2 . Importantly  our study offered a potential at-home treatment for combating SARS-CoV-2 and future coronavirus infections.

However  as soon as the first vaccines—the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far—were released  mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged  raising doubts about their efficiency. This study aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and angiotensin-converting enzyme II  ACE2  for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state  in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor  ACE2  rather than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2  since the difference observed in the free energy values was small  although more attractive in general . Conversely  the South African Beta variant  B.1.351   compared with the SARS-CoV-2 wild type  wt   is much more stable in the opened state with one or two RBDs in the up position than in the closed state with three RBDs in the down position favoring the infection. Such results contribute to understanding the natural history of disease and indicate possible strategies for developing new therapeutic molecules and adjusting the vaccine doses for higher B-cell antibody production.

Baylor Scott & White Health has implemented  along with laboratory diagnosis  SARS‐CoV‐2 sequencing to identify variants in its geographical service area. We analyzed virus sequencing results of specimens collected across Central Texas and found dramatic changes in variant distribution in the first half of 2021. The alpha variant  B 1.1.7  became predominant at week 13 and continued dominance until week 25. A growth rate of 1.20  R  2  = 0.92  for the first 15 weeks was noted and this growth gradually declined to −0.55  R  2  = 0.99  for the final 13 weeks.

We used a dynamic transmission model to evaluate whether this variant could become dominant in the United States given mounting vaccination coverage and other circulating variants. We show that B.1.351 is unlikely to become dominant even when all fully vaccinated individuals return to their pre-pandemic behavior. However  an improved selection advantage of B.1.351 arising from a combination of increased transmission and immune escape could drive this variant to dominance as early as July 2021 and fuel a resurgence of cases and hospitalizations. Our study underscores the urgency for continued rollout of the current generation of vaccines despite the emergence of immune escape variants.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR in samples collected 116 days apart. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the 2 infections were caused by the most prevalent lineage in Brazil  B.1.1.33  and the emerging lineage P.2. The first infection occurred in June 2020; Bayesian analysis suggests reinfection at some point during September 14–October 11  2020  a few days before the second episode of coronavirus disease.

The P.2 lineage was initially detected in the state of Rio de Janeiro  and since then it has been found throughout the country. Our findings suggest not only a reinfection case but also geographic dissemination of the emerging Brazil clade P.2.

In early 2020  Cyprus  among other European countries  was affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and adopted lockdown measures in March 2020 to limit the initial outbreak on the island. In this study  we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis  genetic  phylogenetic  phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses  of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021  covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples  nasopharyngeal swabs  obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus  with B.1.258  B.1.1.29  B.1.177  B.1.2  B.1 and B.1.1.7  designated a Variant of Concern 202012 01  VOC  being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection  with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages  B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021 . Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein  L18F  ΔH69 V70  S898F  ΔY144  S162G  A222V  N439K  N501Y  A570D  D614G  P681H  S982A and D1118H  that confer higher transmissibility and or antibody escape  immune evasion  upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom  UK   although many other regions countries were identified  southeastern Asia  southern Europe  eastern Europe  Germany  Italy  Brazil  Chile  the USA  Denmark  the Czech Republic  Slovenia  Finland  Switzerland and Pakistan . Taken together  these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries  resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island.

Understanding their capabilities and limitations is  therefore  essential for successful implementation. We evaluated six commercial LFDs and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and PCR cycle threshold  Ct  values. METHODS: In a single-centre  laboratory evaluation study  we did a head-to-head comparison of six LFDs commercially available in the UK: Innova Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test  Spring Healthcare SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette  E25Bio Rapid Diagnostic Test  Encode SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Device  SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test Cassette  and SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Fluorescence Antigen Test. We estimated the specificities and sensitivities of the LFDs using stored naso-oropharyngeal swabs collected at St Thomas' Hospital  London  UK  for routine diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR  RT-rtPCR . Swabs were from inpatients and outpatients from all departments of St Thomas' Hospital  and from health-care staff  all departments  and their household contacts. SARS-CoV-2-negative swabs from the same population  confirmed by RT-rtPCR  were used for comparative specificity determinations. All samples were collected between March 23 and Oct 27  2020. We determined the limit of detection  LOD  for each test using viral plaque-forming units  PFUs  and viral RNA copy numbers of laboratory-grown SARS-CoV-2. Additionally  LFDs were selected to assess the correlation of antigen test result with RT-rtPCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero E6 cells. This analysis included longitudinal swabs from five infected inpatients with varying disease severities. Furthermore  the sensitivities of available LFDs were assessed in swabs  n=23; collected from Dec 4  2020  to Jan 12  2021  confirmed to be positive  RT-rtPCR and whole-genome sequencing  for the B.1.1.7 variant  which was the dominant genotype in the UK at the time of study completion. FINDINGS: All LFDs showed high specificity  ≥98·0%   except for the E25Bio test  86·0% [95% CI 77·9–99·9]   and most tests reliably detected 50 PFU test  equivalent SARS-CoV-2 N gene Ct value of 23·7  or RNA copy number of 3 × 10 6  mL . Sensitivities of the LFDs on clinical samples ranged from 65·0%  55·2–73·6  to 89·0%  81·4–93·8 . These sensitivities increased to greater than 90% for samples with Ct values of lower than 25 for all tests except the SureScreen fluorescence  SureScreen-F  test. Positive virus culture was identified in 57  40·4%  of 141 samples; 54  94·7%  of the positive cultures were from swabs with Ct values lower than 25. Among the three LFDs selected for detailed comparisons  the tests with highest sensitivity [Innova]  highest specificity [Encode]  and alternative technology [SureScreen-F]   sensitivity of the LFDs increased to at least 94·7% when only including samples with detected viral growth. Longitudinal studies of RT-rtPCR-positive samples  tested with Innova  Encode  and both SureScreen-F and the SureScreen visual [SureScreen-V] test  showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive. Test performance  assessed for Innova and SureScreen-V  was not affected when reassessed on swabs positive for the UK variant B.1.1.7. INTERPRETATION: In this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFDs and virus infectivity  we found a clear relationship between Ct values  quantitative culture of infectious virus  and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups with LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity  which would help to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations in which they would otherwise go undetected.

Vaccines have been developed and authorized  but the supply of these vaccines is currently limited. With new variants of the virus now emerging and spreading globally  it is essential to develop therapeutics that are broadly protective and bind conserved epitopes in the receptor binding domain  RBD  or the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study  we generated mouse monoclonal antibodies  MAbs  against different epitopes on the RBD and assessed binding and neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that antibodies with neutralizing activity  but not nonneutralizing antibodies  lower viral titers in the lungs when administered in a prophylactic setting in vivo in a mouse challenge model. In addition  most of the MAbs cross-neutralize the B.1.351 as well as the B.1.1.7 variant in vitro.

The trimeric spike  S  protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic with the receptor-binding domain  RBD  that binds first to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  and is therefore the target of many neutralizing antibodies. In this study  we characterized a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody  mAb  9G8  which shows potent neutralization against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 wild-type  WT   Alpha  B.1.1.7   and Delta  1.617.2  viruses. Furthermore  mAb 9G8 also displayed a prominent neutralizing efficacy in the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test  sVNT  against the Epsilon  B.1.429 7   Kappa  B.1.617.1   Gamma  P.1   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta Plus  1.617.2.1  RBD variants in addition to the variants mentioned above. Based on our in vitro escape mutant studies  we proved that the mutations V483F and Y489H within the RBD were involved in ACE2 binding and caused the neutralizing evasion of the virus from mAb 9G8. The development of such a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody against majority of the SARS-CoV-2 variants provides an important insight into pursuing future therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Little is known about the epistatic effects of combined SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. We now investigate the neutralization sensitivity of variants containing the non-RBD mutation Q677H  including B.1.525  Nigerian isolate  and Bluebird  U.S. isolate  variants. The effect on neutralization of Q677H was determined in the context of the RBD mutations and in the background of major VOCs  including B.1.1.7  United Kingdom  Alpha   B.1.351  South Africa  Beta   and P1-501Y-V3  Brazil  Gamma . We demonstrate that the Q677H mutation increases viral infectivity and syncytium formation  as well as enhancing resistance to neutralization for VOCs  including B.1.1.7 and P1-501Y-V3. Our work highlights the importance of epistatic interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and the continued need to monitor Q677H-bearing VOCs.

The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody neutralization has been recently investigated. We report that another emergent variant from Brazil  P.1  is not only refractory to multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but also more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera. The magnitude of resistance is greater for monoclonal antibodies than vaccinee sera and evident with both pseudovirus and authentic P.1 virus. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals that the P.1 trimer adopts exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the “up” position  which is known to facilitate binding to entry receptor ACE2. The functional impact of P.1 mutations thus appears to arise from local changes instead of global conformational alterations. The P.1 variant threatens current antibody therapies but less so protective vaccine efficacy.

The impact on binding with the neutralizing antibodies was also assessed with an ELISA assay. Pseudotyped virus carrying a L452R-E484Q variant showed a comparable infectivity compared with D614G. However  there was a significant reduction in the neutralization activity of the immune sera from non-human primates vaccinated with a recombinant receptor binding domain  RBD  protein  convalescent patients  and healthy vaccinees vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine. In addition  there was a reduction in binding of L452R-E484Q-D614G protein to the antibodies of the immune sera from vaccinated non-human primates. These results highlight the interplay between infectivity and other biologic factors involved in the natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Reduced neutralization activities against the L452R-E484Q variant will have an impact on health authority planning and implications for the vaccination strategy new vaccine development.

SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant indicated the higher transmission among human‐to‐human and increasing hospitalisation. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was observed in domestic animals showing human‐to‐pet transmission. In the current study  we report the first direct known human‐to‐cat transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant within the same family. Previous findings showed that companion animals can get infected by COVID‐19 patients after 3–6 weeks; however  according to our molecular findings  the cat was infected by the viral variant at the same period. Moreover  B.1.1.7 infection caused and developed several clinical symptoms including cardiac and ocular abnormalities. Overall  our findings determined the first direct and high transmission ability of the B.1.1.7 variant from COVID‐19 affected family members to cat. This result showed that the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant could have the highest transition capacity from human to domestic cat as shown for human‐to‐human. The governmental or worldwide policies should consider more detailed against the war with COVID‐19 pandemic.

We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from various regions of Slovakia between November and December 2020 that were presumed to contain B.1.1.7 variant due to drop-out of the Spike gene target in an RT-qPCR test caused by this deletion. Sequencing of these samples revealed that although in some cases the samples were indeed confirmed as B.1.1.7  a substantial fraction of samples contained another ∆H69 ∆V70 carrying mutant belonging to the lineage B.1.258  which has been circulating in Central Europe since August 2020  long before the import of B.1.1.7. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the early sublineage of B.1.258 acquired the N439K substitution in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the Spike protein and  later on  also the deletion ∆H69 ∆V70 in the Spike N-terminal domain  NTD . This variant was particularly common in several European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia but has been quickly replaced by B.1.1.7 early in 2021.

Assessing and quantifying the transmissibility and competitive advantage of the Delta variant is of major significance for countries around the world so that appropriate measures to mitigate and even eliminate the epidemic can be introduced. Aiming at such problems  we proposed a method to model the invasion process of a novel strain and estimate the competitive advantage of the invading strain over the local strain. We applied this method to study the invasion and spread of the Delta variant into England. We have estimated the basic reproduction number of the Delta variant as being 49% higher than that of the Alpha variant  CI: 45–52%   assuming a mean generation interval of 5 days with a standard deviation of 3 days. In the period 11 April to 17 May 2021  the effective reproduction number of the Delta variant was 65% higher than that of the Alpha variant in England  CI: 61–70% . Our results show that the Delta variant has a significantly higher transmission capacity than other strains  which explains the rebound of the epidemic in many countries  even in those with relatively high vaccination coverages.

Plitidepsin  a cyclic depsipeptide authorized in Australia for patients with refractory multiple myeloma  has recently emerged as a candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge on plitidepsin’s clinical profile  anti-tumour and anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms and correlate this with available or anticipated  preclinical or clinical evidence on the drug’s potential for COVID-19 treatment.PubMed  Scopus  CENTRAL  clinicaltrials.gov  medRxiv and bioRxiv databases were searched.Plitidepsinexerts its anti-tumour and antiviral properties primarily through acting on isoforms of the host cell’s eukaryotic-translation-elongation-factor-1-alpha  eEF1A . Through inhibiting eEF1A and therefore translation of necessary viral proteins  it behaves as a “host-directed” anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. In respect to its potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties  the drug has demonstrated superior ex vivo efficacy compared to other host-directed agents and remdesivir  and it might retain its antiviral effect against the more transmittable B.1.1.7 variant. Its well-studied safety profile  also in combination with dexamethasone  may accelerate its repurposing chances for COVID-19 treatment. Preliminary findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients  have suggested potential safety and efficacy of plitidepsin  in terms of viral load reduction and clinical resolution. However  the still incomplete understanding of its exact integration into host cell–SARS-CoV-2 interactions  its intravenous administration exclusively purposing it for hospital settings the and precocity of clinical data are currently considered its chief deficits. A phase III trial is being planned to compare the plitidepsin–dexamethasone regimen to the current standard of care only in moderately affected hospitalized patients. Despite plitidepsin’s preclinical efficacy  current clinical evidence is inadequate for its registration in COVID-19 patients.Therefore  multicentre trials on the drug’s efficacy  potentially also studying populations of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages  are warranted.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a dire multisectoral crisis all around the world. This study investigates and characterizes local isolates from East Java  Indonesia. Methods: There were 54 patients suspected with SARS-COV-2 infection and 27 patients were COVID-19 positive. Virus isolates were obtained from COVID-19 inpatients’ nasopharyngeal swabs at the Dr Soetomo Teaching Hospital  Surabaya. There were only three isolates  #6  #11  #35  with good growth characteristics. Serial blind passage and cytopathic effect observation in the Vero E6 cell line were performed for virus isolation. Confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was proven by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions using SARS-CoV-2 specific primers  scanning electron microscopy  and scanning transmission electron microscopy examination. Whole genome sequencing was performed using ARTIC protocol. Furthermore  SARS-CoV-2 characterization was identified through a western blot using rabbit serum immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and human natural COVID-19 infection serum. Results: Spike gene analysis of three samples  #6  #11  #35  found that the D614G mutation was detected in all isolates  although one isolate exhibited the D215Y and E484D mutation. Based on whole genome analysis  those three isolates were included in clade 20A  and two isolates were included in lineage B.1.6 with one isolate belongs to lineage B.1.4.7. Conclusion: Based on molecular characterization and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 East Java  Indonesia showed high titer and it has mutation in some regions.

METHODS: Sera from 59 vaccinees were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G  IgG  and virus-neutralising antibodies  VNA  with three IgG assays based on  parts of  the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S -protein as antigen  an IgG immunoblot  additionally contains the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein  NP  as an antigen   a surrogate neutralisation test  sVNT   and a Vero-cell-based virus-neutralisation test  cVNT  with the B.1.1.7 variant of concern  VOC; alpha  as antigen. Investigation was done before and after heterologous  n = 30 and 42  or homologous booster vaccination  AZD1222 AZD1222  n = 8 9; BNT162b2 BNT162b2  n = 8 8 . After the second immunisation  a subgroup of 26 age- and gender-matched sera  AZD1222 mRNA  n = 9; AZD1222 AZD1222  n = 9; BNT162b2 BNT162b2  n = 8  was also tested for VNA against VOC B.1.617.2  delta  in the cVNT. The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by avidity. RESULTS: After the first vaccination  the prevalence of IgG directed against the  trimeric  SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its receptor binding domain  RBD  varied from 55–95%  AZD1222  to 100%  BNT162b2   depending on the vaccine regimen and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used. The booster vaccination resulted in 100% seroconversion and the occurrence of highly avid IgG  which is directed against the S-protein subunit 1 and the RBD  as well as VNA against VOC B.1.1.7  while anti-NP IgGs were not detected. The results of the three anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests showed an excellent correlation to the VNA titres against this VOC. The agreement of cVNT and sVNT results was good. However  the sVNT seems to overestimate non- and weak B.1.1.7-neutralising titres. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations and the B.1.1.7-neutralising titres were significantly higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous AZD1222 scheme. If VOC B.1.617.2 was used as antigen  significantly lower VNA titres were measured in the cVNT  and three  33.3%  vector vaccine recipients had a VNA titre < 1:10. CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations and VNA titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination scheme. Irrespective of the chosen immunisation regime  highly avid IgG antibodies can be detected just 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity. The reduction in the VNA titre against VOC B.1.617.2 observed in the subgroup of 26 individuals is remarkable and confirms the immune escape of the delta variant.

The four samples previously positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  were sequenced by a high-performance platform and the genomic analysis confirmed that lineages responsible for infections were B.1.91 and B.1.1.33  patient 1   and B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28  patient 2 . The interval between the two positive RT-qPCR for patients 1 and 2 was 45 and 61 days  respectively. This data shows that patients may be reinfected even by very closely related SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

It has since rapidly become the predominant lineage  owing to high transmissibility. It is suspected that the delta variant is associated with more severe disease than the previously dominant alpha  B.1.1.7  variant. We aimed to characterise the severity of the delta variant compared with the alpha variant by determining the relative risk of hospital attendance outcomes. METHODS: This cohort study was done among all patients with COVID-19 in England between March 29 and May 23  2021  who were identified as being infected with either the alpha or delta SARS-CoV-2 variant through whole-genome sequencing. Individual-level data on these patients were linked to routine health-care datasets on vaccination  emergency care attendance  hospital admission  and mortality  data from Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System and COVID-19-associated deaths dataset; the National Immunisation Management System; and NHS Digital Secondary Uses Services and Emergency Care Data Set . The risk for hospital admission and emergency care attendance were compared between patients with sequencing-confirmed delta and alpha variants for the whole cohort and by vaccination status subgroups. Stratified Cox regression was used to adjust for age  sex  ethnicity  deprivation  recent international travel  area of residence  calendar week  and vaccination status. FINDINGS: Individual-level data on 43 338 COVID-19-positive patients  8682 with the delta variant  34 656 with the alpha variant; median age 31 years [IQR 17–43]  were included in our analysis. 196  2·3%  patients with the delta variant versus 764  2·2%  patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital within 14 days after the specimen was taken  adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2·26 [95% CI 1·32–3·89] . 498  5·7%  patients with the delta variant versus 1448  4·2%  patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital or attended emergency care within 14 days  adjusted HR 1·45 [1·08–1·95] . Most patients were unvaccinated  32 078 [74·0%] across both groups . The HRs for vaccinated patients with the delta variant versus the alpha variant  adjusted HR for hospital admission 1·94 [95% CI 0·47–8·05] and for hospital admission or emergency care attendance 1·58 [0·69–3·61]  were similar to the HRs for unvaccinated patients  2·32 [1·29–4·16] and 1·43 [1·04–1·97]; p=0·82 for both  but the precision for the vaccinated subgroup was low. INTERPRETATION: This large national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. Results suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.

Little is known about the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents in the general population  as opposed to a clinical trial population. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study among adolescents  aged 12-18 years  who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  test. Immunization histories  relevant clinical data  and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health System’s medical records between June 1  2021  and August 15  2021  when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age  county of residence  and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine’s effectiveness  VE  was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms  number of vaccine doses received  and elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14  IQR  13-16  years  262  48%  identified as female  81  15%  as Black  82  15%  as Hispanic  and 297  55%  as White. Overall  134  25%  were fully immunized  case participants  10 [5%]; control participants  124 [35%] . The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days  range  17-129 days . Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses  VE against any infection was estimated to be 91%  95% CI  80%-96% ; against asymptomatic infection  85%  95% CI  57%-95% . Effectiveness after a single dose was estimated to be 74%  95% CI  18%-92% . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective case-control study of US adolescents  2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine appeared to provide excellent protection for at least 4 months after immunization against both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Whether declines in effectiveness are due to waning immunity  the B.1.617.2  delta  variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   or other causes is unknown. METHODS: We used data for 8 690 825 adults in New York State to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2  mRNA-1273  and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalization with Covid-19  i.e.  Covid-19 diagnosed at or after admission . We compared cohorts defined according to vaccine product received  age  and month of full vaccination with age-specific unvaccinated cohorts by linking statewide testing  hospital  and vaccine registry databases. We assessed vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 from May 1 through September 3  2021  and against hospitalization with Covid-19 from May 1 through August 31  2021. RESULTS: There were 150 865 cases of Covid-19 and 14 477 hospitalizations with Covid-19. During the week of May 1  2021  when the delta variant made up 1.8% of the circulating variants  the median vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 91.3%  range  84.1 to 97.0  for BNT162b2  96.9%  range  93.7 to 98.0  for mRNA-1273  and 86.6%  range  77.8 to 89.7  for Ad26.COV2.S. Subsequently  effectiveness declined contemporaneously in all cohorts  from a median of 93.4%  range  77.8 to 98.0  during the week of May 1 to a nadir of 73.5%  range  13.8 to 90.0  around July 10  when the prevalence of the delta variant was 85.3%. By the week of August 28  when the prevalence of the delta variant was 99.6%  the effectiveness was 74.2%  range  63.4 to 86.8 . Effectiveness against hospitalization with Covid-19 among adults 18 to 64 years of age remained almost exclusively greater than 86%  with no apparent time trend. Effectiveness declined from May through August among persons 65 years of age or older who had received BNT162b2  from 94.8 to 88.6%  or mRNA-1273  from 97.1 to 93.7% . The effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S was lower than that of the other vaccines  with no trend observed over time  range  80.0 to 90.6% . CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the three vaccines against Covid-19 declined after the delta variant became predominant. The effectiveness against hospitalization remained high  with modest declines limited to BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 recipients 65 years of age or older.

It is too early to speculate on transmission and hospitalizations. Hence  more analyses are required  particularly to connect the genomic patterns to the phenotypic attributes to reveal the binding differences and antibody response for this variant  which can then be used for therapeutic interventions. Given the urgency of the required analysis and data on the B.1.1.529 variant  we have performed a detailed investigation to provide an understanding of the impact of these novel mutations on the structure  function  and binding of RBD to hACE2 and mAb to the NTD of the spike protein. The differences in the binding pattern between the wild type and B.1.1.529 variant complexes revealed that the key substitutions Asn417  Ser446  Arg493  and Arg498 in the B.1.1.529 RBD caused additional interactions with hACE2 and the loss of key residues in the B.1.1.529 NTD resulted in decreased interactions with three CDR regions  1–3  in the mAb. Further investigation revealed that B.1.1.529 displayed a stable dynamic that follows a global stability trend. In addition  the dissociation constant  K D    hydrogen bonding analysis  and binding free energy calculations further validated the findings. Hydrogen bonding analysis demonstrated that significant hydrogen bonding reprogramming took place  which revealed key differences in the binding. The total binding free energy using MM GBSA and MM PBSA further validated the docking results and demonstrated significant variations in the binding. This study is the first to provide a basis for the higher infectivity of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides a strong impetus for the development of novel drugs against them.

Here  we document the first reported case of infection caused by the Delta  B.1.617.2  variant of concern  VOC  in a dog in Spain that lived with several household members suffering from Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019  COVID-19 . The animal displayed mild digestive and respiratory clinical signs and had a low viral load in the oropharyngeal swab collected at the first sampling. Whole-genome sequencing indicated infection with the Delta variant  coinciding with the predominant variant during the fifth pandemic wave in Spain. The dog seroconverted  as detected 21 days after the first sampling  and developed neutralizing antibodies that cross-neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 variants. This study further emphasizes the importance of studying the susceptibility of animal species to different VOCs and their potential role as reservoirs in the context of COVID-19.

Recently  this variant has spread in Guangzhou  China. Our objective was to characterize the clinical features and risk factors of severe cases of the Delta variant in Guangzhou. Methods: A total of 144 patients with the Delta variant were enrolled  and the data between the severe and non-severe groups were compared. Logistic regression methods and Cox multivariate regression analysis were used to investigate the risk factors of severe cases. Results: The severity of the Delta variant was 11.1%. Each 1-year increase in age  OR  1.089; 95% CI  1.035–1.147; P = 0.001  and each 1-μmol L increase in total bilirubin  OR  1.198; 95% CI  1.021–1.406; P = 0.039  were risk factors for severe cases. Moreover  the risk of progression to severe cases increased 13.444-fold and 3.922-fold when the age was greater than 58.5 years  HR  13.444; 95% CI  2.989–60.480; P = 0.001  or the total bilirubin level was greater than 7.23 μmol L  HR  3.922; 95% CI  1.260–12.207; P = 0.018   respectively. Conclusion: Older age and elevated total bilirubin were independent risk factors for severe cases of the Delta variant in Guangzhou  especially if the age was greater than 58.5 years or the total bilirubin level was greater than 7.23 μmol L.

Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.1.7  alpha  and lineage A  in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated  which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance  only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup  aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8  N = 4 for each variant  sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour  highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly  the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined  this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.

However  most implemented SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance projects were based on qPCR measurement of virus titers and did not address the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population. METHODS: We have implemented a nanopore RNA sequencing monitoring system in the city of Nice  France  550 000 inhabitants . Between October 2020 and March 2021  we monthly analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 variants in 113 wastewater samples collected in the main wastewater treatment plant and 20 neighborhoods. FINDINGS: We initially detected the lineages predominant in Europe at the end of 2020  B.1.160  B.1.177  B.1.367  B.1.474  and B.1.221 . In January  a localized emergence of a variant  Spike:A522S  of the B.1.1.7 lineage occurred in one neighborhood. It rapidly spread and became dominant all over the city. Other variants of concern  B.1.351  P.1  were also detected in some neighborhoods  but at low frequency. Comparison with individual clinical samples collected during the same week showed that wastewater sequencing correctly identified the same lineages as those found in COVID-19 patients. INTERPRETATION: Wastewater sequencing allowed to document the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the different neighborhoods of the city of Nice. Our results illustrate how sequencing of sewage samples can be used to track pathogen sequence diversity in the current pandemics and in future infectious disease outbreaks.

Here  we detected SARS-CoV-2 virus using rRT-PCR in 129 out of 360  35.8%  free-ranging white-tailed deer  Odocoileus virginianus  from northeast Ohio  USA  sampled between January-March 2021. Deer in 6 locations were infected with at least 3 lineages of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.2  B.1.596  B.1.582 . The B.1.2 viruses  dominant in Ohio at the time  spilled over multiple times into deer populations in different locations. Deer-to-deer transmission may have occurred in three locations. The establishment of a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer could facilitate divergent evolutionary trajectories and future spillback to humans  further complicating long-term COVID-19 control strategies.

The past year has been marked by the emergence of variants that have led to a succession of epidemic waves. It thus appears that monitoring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater alone is insufficient  and it may be important in the future to also monitor the evolution of these variants. We used a real-time RT-PCR screening test for variants in the wastewater of our city to assess the effectiveness of direct SARS-CoV-2 sequencing from the same wastewater. We compared the genome sequencing results obtained over the large RS network and the smaller B7 network with the different distributions of the variants observed by RT-PCR screening. The prevalence of the “UK variant” in the RS and B7 networks was estimated to be 70% and 8% using RT-PCR screening compared to 95% and 64% using genome sequencing  respectively. The latter values were close to the epidemiology observed in patients of the corresponding area  which were 91% and 58%  respectively. Genome sequencing in sewage identified SARS-CoV-2 of lineage B.1.525 in B7 at 27%  37% in patients   whereas it was completely missed by RT-PCR. We thus determined that direct sequencing makes it possible to observe  in wastewater  a distribution of the variants comparable to that revealed by genomic monitoring in patients and that this method is more accurate than RT-PCR. It also shows that  rather than a single large sample  it would be preferable to analyse several targeted samples if we want to more appropriately assess the geographical distribution of the different variants. In conclusion  this work supports the wider surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater by genome sequencing and targeting small areas on the condition of having a sequencing capacity and  when this is not the case  to developing more precise screening tests based on the multiplexed detection of the mutations of interest.

In this study  we compared the incidence curves of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in different countries and reported the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in our institute  as well as the kinetics and sources of the infections. We used mortality collected from a COVID-19 data repository for 221 countries. Viral variants were defined based on ≥5 hallmark mutations along the whole genome shared by ≥30 genomes. SARS-CoV-2 genotype was determined for 24 181 patients using next-generation genome and gene sequencing  in 47 and 11% of cases  respectively  or variant-specific qPCR  in 42% of cases . Sixteen variants were identified by analyzing viral genomes from 9 788 SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed patients. Our data show that since the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic episode in Marseille  importation through travel from abroad was documented for seven of the new variants. In addition  for the B.1.160 variant of Pangolin classification  a.k.a. Marseille-4   we suspect transmission from farm minks. In conclusion  we observed that the successive epidemic peaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not linked to rebounds of viral genotypes that are already present but to newly introduced variants. We thus suggest that border control is the best mean of combating this type of introduction  and that intensive control of mink farms is also necessary to prevent the emergence of new variants generated in this animal reservoir.

In this context  it urgently needs to develop new rapid tools for quickly predicting the affinity of ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein variants to be used with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities in the clinics  aiming to gain clues about the transmissibility and virulence of new variants  to prevent new outbreaks and to quickly estimate the severity of the disease in the context of the 3PM. METHODS: In our study  we used a computational pipeline for calculating the interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD ACE2 protein–protein interface for a selected group of characterized infectious variants of concern interest  VoC VoI . By using our pipeline  we built 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD ACE2 protein complexes for the VoC B.1.1.7-United Kingdom  carrying the mutations of concern interest N501Y  S494P  E484K at the RBD   P.1-Japan Brazil  RBD mutations: K417T  E484K  N501Y   B.1.351-South Africa  RBD mutations: K417N  E484K  N501Y   B.1.427 B.1.429-California  RBD mutations: L452R   the B.1.141  RBD mutations: N439K   and the recent B.1.617.1-India  RBD mutations: L452R; E484Q  and the B.1.620  RBD mutations: S477N; E484K . Then  we used the obtained 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD ACE2 protein complexes for predicting the interaction energies at the protein–protein interface. RESULTS: Along SARS-CoV-2 mutation database screening and mutation localization analysis  it was ascertained that the most dangerous mutations at VoC VoI spike proteins are located mainly at three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike “boat-shaped” receptor binding motif  on the RBD domain. Notably  the P.1 Japan Brazil variant present three mutations  K417T  E484K  N501Y  located along the entire receptor binding motif  which apparently determines the highest interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD ACE2 protein–protein interface  among those calculated. Conversely  it was also observed that the replacement of a single acidic hydrophilic residue with a basic residue  E484K or N439K  at the “stern” or “bow” regions  of the boat-shaped receptor binding motif on the RBD  appears to determine an interaction energy with ACE2 receptor higher than that observed with single mutations occurring at the “hull” region or with other multiple mutants. In addition  our pipeline allowed searching for ACE2 structurally related proteins  i.e.  THOP1 and NLN  which deserve to be investigated for their possible involvement in interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  in those tissues showing a low expression of ACE2  or as a novel receptor for future spike variants. A freely available web-tool for the in silico calculation of the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD ACE2 protein–protein interface  starting from the sequences of the investigated spike and or ACE2 variants  was made available for the scientific community at: https:  www.mitoairm.it covid19affinities. CONCLUSION: In the context of the PPPM 3PM  the employment of the described pipeline through the provided webservice  together with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing  would help to predict the transmissibility of new variants sequenced from future patients  depending on SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities and on the specific amino acid replacement and or on its location on the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD  to put in play all the possible counteractions for preventing the most deleterious scenarios of new outbreaks  taking into consideration that a greater transmissibility has not to be necessarily related to a more severe manifestation of the disease.

These mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has been investigated  sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen  HLA -restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored. Here  we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  L452R  in B.1.427 429 and B.1.617  and Y453F  in B.1.1.298   confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor ACE2. Notably  the L452R mutation increases spike stability  viral infectivity  viral fusogenicity  and thereby promotes viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.

We analyzed the mutational landscape of Omicron throughout the genome  focusing the S-glycoprotein. We also evaluated mutations in the antibody-binding regions and observed some important mutations overlapping those of previous variants including N501Y  D614G  H655Y  N679K  and P681H. Various new receptor-binding domain mutations were detected  including Q493K  G496S  Q498R  S477N  G466S  N440K  and Y505H. New mutations were found in the NTD  Δ143-145  A67V  T95I  L212I  and Δ211  including one new mutation in fusion peptide  D796Y . There are several mutations in the antibody-binding region including K417N  E484A  Q493K  Q498R  N501Y  and Y505H and several near the antibody-binding region  S477N  T478K  G496S  G446S  and N440K . The impact of mutations in regions important for the affinity between spike proteins and neutralizing antibodies was evaluated. Furthermore  we examined the effect of significant antibody-binding mutations  K417N  T478K  E484A  and N501Y  on antibody affinity  stability to ACE2 interaction  and possibility of amino acid substitution. All the four mutations destabilize the antibody-binding affinity. This study reveals future directions for developing neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 testing and sequencing combines TaqPath CE-IVD COVID-19 RT-PCR with Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Next Generation Sequencing Assay. Retrospective analysis of test trending data was performed from initiation of testing on the 11th March through to the 14th April 2021. FINDINGS: During this time interval  203 065 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed  with 3 855 samples testing positive  giving a prevalence of 1.9%. In total 1 913 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from positive cases with Ct values < 30 and 1 635  85.5%  sequences passed quality metrics for lineage analysis. A high diversity of 49 different SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified  including the VOCs B.1.1.7  Kent; 80.6%   B.1.351  South Africa; 4.2%   B.1.617.2  India; 1.7%   P.1  Brazil; 0.4%  and B.1.1.7 with E484K  Bristol; 0.2% . Vaccine effectiveness was age-related and dose-dependent  ranging from 5% in > 60 with a single dose to 83% in <60 with both doses of a vaccine. Viral load was variant dependent with the B.1.617.2 showing a 21 fold increase in viral copy number compared to the other variants. INTERPRETATION: The unexpectedly high prevalence of COVID-19 infection in UK arrivals is associated with a rich diversity of SARS-CoV-2 high risk variants entering the UK including the VOC B.1.617.2. Vaccination does not preclude infection and its effectiveness is significantly age-dependent and impacted by variant type. The rapid high-throughput test and sequence workflow we have adopted is particularly suited to the monitoring of cross border transmission and enables immediate public health interventions. FUNDING: Data analysis conducted in this study was limited to secondary use of information previously collected in the course of normal care.

The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterized 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID19+ subjects and identified 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targeted the NTD  one recognized an epitope in S2 and eleven bound the RBD. Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model  we demonstrate that the neutralization potency and antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralized the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus  our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.

Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity  we measured neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273  111 BNT162b  and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild type  Delta  and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that were vaccinated recently  <3 months   distantly  6-12 months   or recently boosted  and accounted for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably  neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinated individuals. However  individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type  suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition  we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested. Overall  this study highlights the importance of boosters to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Here  we describe the development of chimpanzee adenovirus serotypes 6 and 68  AdC6 and AdC68  vector-based vaccine candidates expressing the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein. We assessed the vaccine immunogenicity  protective efficacy  and immune cell profiles using single-cell RNA sequencing in mice. Mice were vaccinated via the intramuscular route with the two vaccine candidates using prime-only regimens or heterologous prime-boost regimens. Both chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines elicited strong and long-term antibody and T cell responses  balanced Th1 Th2 cell responses  robust germinal center responses  and provided effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse lungs. Strikingly  we found that heterologous prime-boost immunization induced higher titers of protective antibodies  and more spike-specific memory CD8 +  T cells in mice. Potent neutralizing antibodies produced against the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 lineage  also known as N501Y.V1  and B.1.351 lineage  also known as N501Y.V2  were detectable in mouse sera over 6 months after prime immunization. Our results demonstrate that the heterologous prime-boost strategy with chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines is promising for further development to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In December 2020  a new alpha strain of SARS-CoV2 was identified in the United Kingdom. It was referred to as VUI 202012 01  Alpha strain modelled under investigation  2020  month 12  number 01 . The interaction between spike protein and ACE2 receptor is a prerequisite for entering virion into the host cell. The present study is focussed on the spike protein of the SARS-COV 2  involving the comparison of binding affinity of new alpha strain modelled spike with previous strain spike  PDB ID:7DDN  using in silico molecular docking  dynamics and simulation studies. The molecular docking studies of the alpha strain modelled spike protein confirmed its higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor than the spike protein of the dominant strain. Similar computational approaches have also been used to investigate the potency of FDA approved drugs from the ZINC Database against the spike protein of new alpha strain modelled and old ones. The drug molecules which showed strong affinity for both the spike proteins are then subjected to ADME analysis. The low overall binding energy of Conivaptan  -107.503 kJ mol  and Trosec  -94.029 kJ mol  is indicative of their strong binding affinities  well supported by interactions with critical residues.

COVI-VAC™  a Live Attenuated COVID-19 Vaccine  Provides Single Dose Protection Against Heterologous Challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Beta  B.1.351  in the Syrian Golden Hamster Model,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.775,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.775,,pmc:PMC8644885,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,577. COVI-VAC™  a Live Attenuated COVID-19 Vaccine  Provides Single Dose Protection Against Heterologous Challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Beta  B.1.351  in the Syrian Golden Hamster Model,BACKGROUND: Although multiple COVID-19 vaccines are currently in use  emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced neutralization raises concern of future vaccine escape. COVI-VAC™ is a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 strain based on WA 1 being developed as an intranasal COVID-19 vaccine. COVI-VAC is attenuated through removal of the furin cleavage site and introduction of 283 silent  deoptimizing mutations that maintain viral amino acid sequence but slow viral replication in vivo by up to 5 logs. Notably  COVI-VAC presents all viral antigens in their native conformation and is not limited to spike. COVI-VAC demonstrated attenuation  immunogenicity and single dose protection in both the Syrian golden hamster and non-human primate models and currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. In this study  we evaluated efficacy of COVI-VAC against challenge with the Beta B.1.351 variant in Syrian golden hamsters. METHODS: Syrian golden hamsters  7-10 weeks of age were  vaccinated intranasally with 8.25x10 4  PFU COVI-VAC  n=28  or vehicle control  n=16 . Twenty seven days post-vaccination  animals were challenged intranasally with 3x10 4  PFU of wildtype  WT  SARS-CoV-2 Beta. Animals were weighed daily. Further analysis is being conducted with serum and key tissues from pre and post challenge timepoints to include neutralizing antibody  biodistribution  subgenomic qPCR  and histopathology. RESULTS: COVI-VAC prevented weight loss following challenge with the heterologous variant of SARS-CoV-2  B.1.351 Beta  Figure . Results of additional analyses will be available before the IDWeek meeting. Change in Weight following SARS-CoV-2 Beta Challenge [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVI-VAC is protective against heterologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Beta. By presenting all viral antigens  COVI-VAC may be less affected by viral evolution than spike-based vaccines.

A matched  1:2 ratio  parallel cohort study was performed. During the first three months of vaccination campaign  HCWs of the entire health district ASL Città di Torino  Turin  Italy  were classified according to SARS-CoV-2-positivity in respect of the vaccination schedule: post-first-dose  fHCWs  <12 days   partially  PHCWs  ≥12 from first dose to ≤7 days after the second   and totally vaccinated  THCWs  ≥8 days after the second dose . Age- sex-matched unvaccinated controls were randomly selected from all the SARS-CoV-2-positivity detected in the same district and period. Previous infections were excluded. Clinical and virologic data  ORF1ab gene cycle threshold values  Ct  were recorded. In total  6800 HCWs received at least one dose  and 55 tested positive subsequently: 20 fHCWs  25 PHCWs  10 THCWs. Furthermore  21.8% of breakthrough infections were in male  with a median age of 49 years  32–56   and 51.4% occurred while SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant was predominant. The incident relative risk was 0.13  0.12–0.15  for PHCWs and 0.06  0.05–0.07  for THCWs. Compared to controls  n = 110   no difference was observed in fHCWs  while PHCWs and THCWs showed higher prevalence of asymptomatic infections  fewer signs symptoms with a milder systemic involvement  and significantly higher Ct values  PHCWs 30.3  24.1–35.5  vs. 22.3  19.6–30.6   p = 0.023; THCWs 35.0  31.3–35.9  vs. 22.5  18.2–30.6   p = 0.024 . Duration of symptoms was also shorter in THCWs  5 days  3–6  vs. 9  7–14   p = 0.028 . A linear increase of 3.81 points in Ct values was observed across the groups by vaccination status  p = 0.001  after adjusting for age  sex  comorbidities  and time between COVID-19 onset and swab collection. BNT162b2 decreased the risk of PCR-confirmed infections and severe disease  and was associated with a virologic picture of lesser epidemiologic concern as soon as 12 days after the first vaccine dose.

After the virus sequence was published  we identified two potent antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain  RBD  from antibody libraries using a phage-to-yeast  PtY  display platform in only 10 days. Our lead antibody JMB2002  now in a Phase 1 clinical trial  ChiCTR2100042150   showed broad-spectrum in vitro blocking activity against hACE2 binding to the RBD of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants  including B.1.351 that was reportedly much more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma  vaccine sera and some clinical-stage neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore  JMB2002 has demonstrated complete prophylactic and potent therapeutic efficacy in a rhesus macaque disease model. Prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasure intervention of SARS-CoV-2 using JMB2002 would likely slow down the transmission of currently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants and result in more efficient control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission  there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation  smFISH  to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency  while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes  subgenomic RNAs  and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry  suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover  we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells  with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly  the B.1.1.7 variant  first identified in the UK  exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain  suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.

Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta  and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly  antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However  in lower airway organoids  Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1 S2 cleavage  the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus  PV  entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2  and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore  drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead  we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1 S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2  syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall  Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts  with implications for altered pathogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  a variant identified in the UK in late 2020  contains a higher than typical level of point mutants across its genome  including P681H in the spike S1 S2 cleavage site. Here  we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1 S2 sequence from Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 and observed no definitive difference in furin cleavage between Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 in vitro. We performed functional assays using pseudo-typed particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed no significant differences between Wuhan-Hu1  Wuhan-Hu1 P681H or B.1.1.7 spike-carrying pseudo-typed particles in VeroE6 or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells  despite the spikes containing P681H being more efficiently cleaved. Likewise  we or show no differences in cell-cell fusion assays using the spike P681H-expressing cells. Our findings suggest that while the introduction of P681H in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant may increase spike cleavage by furin-like proteases  this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread. We consider that other factors are at play to account for the increased in transmission and disease severity attributed to this variant of concern  VOC .

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  Alpha   a WHO variant of concern  VOC  first identified in the UK in late 2020  contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1 S2 cleavage site  which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin  potentially impacting the viral cell entry. Here  we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B.1.1.7 cell entry. We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 S1 S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage. Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1  B.1.1.7 or a P681H point mutant. Likewise  we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1 2020 and a B.1.1.7 isolate in cell culture. Our findings suggest that while the B.1.1.7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1 S2 cleavage this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.

While the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of concern  VoC  has been shown to be notably more transmissible amongst humans  its ability to cause infection and spillover to non-human animals remains a challenge of concern. We found that 19 of the 131  14.5%; 95% CI: 0.10–0.22  white-tailed deer opportunistically sampled on Staten Island  New York  between December 12  2021  and January 31  2022  were positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific serum antibodies using a surrogate virus neutralization assay  indicating prior exposure. The results also revealed strong evidence of age-dependence in antibody prevalence. A significantly  χ 2   p < 0.001  greater proportion of yearling deer possessed neutralizing antibodies as compared with fawns  OR=12.7; 95% CI 4–37.5 . Importantly  SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in nasal swabs from seven of 68  10.29%; 95% CI: 0.0–0.20  of the sampled deer  and whole-genome sequencing identified the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VoC  B.1.1.529  is circulating amongst the white-tailed deer on Staten Island. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the deer Omicron sequences clustered closely with other  recently reported Omicron sequences recovered from infected humans in New York City and elsewhere  consistent with human to deer spillover. Interestingly  one individual deer was positive for viral RNA and had a high level of neutralizing antibodies  suggesting either rapid serological conversion during an ongoing infection or a “breakthrough” infection in a previously exposed animal. Together  our findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron VoC can infect white-tailed deer and highlights an urgent need for comprehensive surveillance of susceptible animal species to identify ecological transmission networks and better assess the potential risks of spillback to humans.

Here  we analyzed whether ten naturally-occurring mutations found within the extended loop harboring the S1 S2 cleavage site of the S protein  a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism and pathogenicity  impact S protein processing and function. None of the mutations increased but several decreased S protein cleavage at the S1 S2 site  including S686G and P681H  the latter of which is found in variants of concern B.1.1.7  Alpha variant  and B.1.1.529  Omicron variant . None of the mutations reduced ACE2 binding and cell-cell fusion although several modulated the efficiency of host cell entry. The effects of mutation S686G on viral entry were cell-type dependent and could be linked to the availability of cathepsin L for S protein activation. These results show that polymorphisms at the S1 S2 site can modulate S protein processing and host cell entry.

In this report  we exploit the immunostimulatory properties of bacille Calmette-Guérin  BCG   the existing tuberculosis vaccine  to deliver a vaccination regimen with potent SARS-CoV-2-specific protective immunity. Combination of BCG with a stabilised  trimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen promoted rapid development of virus-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of vaccinated mice  that was further augmented by the addition of alum. This vaccine formulation  BCG:CoVac  induced high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies  NAbs  and Th1-biased cytokine release by vaccine-specific T cells  which correlated with the early emergence of T follicular helper cells in local lymph nodes and heightened levels of antigen-specific plasma B cells after vaccination. Vaccination of K18-hACE2 mice with a single dose of BCG:CoVac almost completely abrogated disease after SARS-CoV-2 challenge  with minimal inflammation and no detectable virus in the lungs of infected animals. Boosting BCG:CoVac-primed mice with a heterologous vaccine further increased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses  which effectively neutralised B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These findings demonstrate the potential for BCG-based vaccination to protect against major SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating globally.

Here we compare SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain  S1-RBD -specific primary MBCs that form in response to infection or a single mRNA vaccination. Both primary MBC populations have similar frequencies in the blood  and respond to a second S1-RBD exposure by rapidly producing plasmablasts with an abundant IgA+ subset  and secondary MBCs that are mostly IgG+ and cross-react on the B.1.351 variant. However  infection-induced primary MBCs have better antigen-binding capacity and generate more plasmablasts and secondary MBCs of the classical and atypical subsets than vaccine-induced primary MBCs. Our results suggest that infection-induced primary MBCs have undergone more affinity maturation than vaccine-induced primary MBCs and produce more robust secondary responses.

This variant is characterized by 17 mutations and 3 deletions. The deletion 69–70 in the spike protein can be detected by commercial platforms  allowing its real-time spread to be known. From the last days of December 2020 and over 4 months  all respiratory samples with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 from patients treated in primary care and the emergency department were screened to detect this variant based on the strategy S gene target failure  SGTF . The first cases were detected during week 53  2020  and reached >90% of all cases during weeks 15–16  2021 . During this period  the B.1.1.7 SGTF variant spread at a rapid and constant replacement rate of around 30–36%. The probability of intensive care unit admission was twice higher among patients infected by the B.1.1.7 SGTF variant  but there were no differences in death rate. During the peak of the third pandemic wave  this variant was not the most prevalent  and it became dominant when this wave was declining. Our results confirm that the B.1.1.7 SGTF variant displaced other SARS-CoV-2 variants in our healthcare area in 4 months. This displacement has led to an increase in the burden of disease.

The Delta  B.1.617.2  variant was first reported in India in October 2020 and was classified as a “variant of concern  VOC ” by the WHO on 11 May  2021. Compared to the wild-type strain  several studies have shown that the Delta variant is more transmissible and has higher viral loads in infected samples. COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta variant have a higher risk of hospitalization  intensive care unit  ICU  admission  and mortality. The Delta variant is becoming the dominant strain in many countries around the world. This review summarizes and analyses the biological characteristics of key amino acid mutations  the epidemic characteristics  and the immune escape of the Delta variant. We hope to provide scientific reference for the monitoring and prevention measures of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and the development strategy of a second-generation vaccine.

We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the VE of various vaccine regimens for preventing COVID-19 during the period when the delta variant was the dominant causative virus  ≥ 95%  in Thailand  25 July 2021–23 Oct 2021 . All individuals  age ≥18 years  at-risk for COVID-19  presented for nasopharyngeal real-time polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  testing  were prospectively enrolled and followed up for disease development. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics. Of 3353 included individuals  there were 1118 cases and 2235 controls. The adjusted VE among persons receiving two-dose CoronaVac plus one BNT162b2 booster was highest  98%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 87–100   followed by those receiving two-dose CoronaVac plus one ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 booster  86%; 95% CI 74–93   two-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  83%; 95% CI 70–90   one CoronaVac dose and one ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose  74%; 95% CI 43–88  and two-dose CoronaVac  60%; 95% CI 49–69 . One dose of CoronaVac or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had a VE of less than 50%. Our study demonstrated the incremental VE with the increase in the number of vaccine doses received. The two-dose CoronaVac plus one BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 booster regimens was highly effective in preventing COVID-19 during the rise of delta variant.

In this study we described which lineages were circulating in the first quarter of 2021 in Southern Brazil to better understand the viral factors involved in the health crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the region  searching also for possible additional SARS-CoV-2 sequence mutations. A total of 70 positive SARS-CoV-2 samples collected between January 28th  2021 until April 23rd  2021  were selected to sequencing. Whole genome sequencing of 70 SARS-CoV-2 samples showed a predominance of Gamma lineage  67%  47 70   followed by P.2 lineage  27%  19 70  and B.1.1.28  6%  4 70 . Two Gamma lineage consensus sequences presented a new S:D614A mutation. Newly mutations could be emerging due the quick SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Thus  the greater understanding about immune protection and variants vigilance is essential to the better management of the health SARS-CoV-2 crisis.

The receptor binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike  S  protein binds to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme type-II  ACE2  to initiate viral attachment and ultimately viral pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  that block RBD - ACE2 interactions. In this report  NAb-RBD binding epitopes in the protein databank were classified as C1  C1D  C2  C3  or C4  using a RBD binding profile  BP   based on NAb-specific RBD buried surface area and used to predict the binding epitopes of a series of uncharacterized NAbs. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence variation was also quantified to predict NAb binding sensitivities to the RBD-variants. NAb and ACE2 binding studies confirmed the NAb classifications and determined whether the RBD variants enhanced ACE2 binding to promote viral infectivity  and or disrupted NAb binding to evade the host immune response. Of 9 single RBD mutants evaluated  K417T  E484K  and N501Y disrupted binding of 65% of the NAbs evaluated  consistent with the assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 Japan Brazil strain as a variant of concern  VoC . RBD variants E484K and N501Y exhibited ACE2 binding equivalent to a Wuhan-1 reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD. While slightly less disruptive to NAb binding  L452R enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. Thus  the L452R mutant  associated with the SARS-CoV-2 California VoC  B.1.427 B.1.429-California   has evolved to enhance ACE2 binding  while simultaneously disrupting C1 and C2 NAb classes. The analysis also identified a non-overlapping antibody pair  1213H7 and 1215D1  that bound to all SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants evaluated  representing an excellent therapeutic option for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 WT and VoC strains.

The rapid deployment of antibody-based countermeasures has provided hope for curtailing disease and ending the pandemic  1  . However  the emergence of rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7   South Africa  B.1.351   and elsewhere with mutations in the spike protein has raised concern for escape from neutralizing antibody responses and loss of vaccine efficacy based on preliminary data with pseudoviruses  2-4  . Here  using monoclonal antibodies  mAbs   animal immune sera  human convalescent sera  and human sera from recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech  BNT162b2  mRNA vaccine  we report the impact on antibody neutralization of a panel of authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including a B.1.1.7 isolate  a chimeric Washington strain with a South African spike gene  Wash SA-B.1.351   and isogenic recombinant variants with designed mutations or deletions at positions 69-70  417  484  501  and or 614 of the spike protein. Several highly neutralizing mAbs engaging the receptor binding domain  RBD  or N-terminal domain  NTD  lost inhibitory activity against Wash SA-B.1.351 or recombinant variants with an E484K spike mutation. Most convalescent sera and virtually all mRNA vaccine-induced immune sera tested showed markedly diminished neutralizing activity against the Wash SA-B.1.351 strain or recombinant viruses containing mutations at position 484 and 501. We also noted that cell line selection used for growth of virus stocks or neutralization assays can impact the potency of antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 variants  which has implications for assay standardization and congruence of results across laboratories. As several antibodies binding specific regions of the RBD and NTD show loss-of-neutralization potency in vitro against emerging variants  updated mAb cocktails  targeting of highly conserved regions  enhancement of mAb potency  or adjustments to the spike sequences of vaccines may be needed to prevent loss of protection in vivo .

In Cyprus  the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9  2020 and since then 33 567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study  viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring  summer and autumn winter wave of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Cyprus  respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant  VOC-202012 01  was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall  we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures.

It is especially interesting in metropolitan areas where spread can be very fast  and proper sewage systems are available for sampling with short flow times and thus little decay of the virus. We started in March 2020 to set up a once-a-week qualified spot sampling protocol in six different locations in Munich carefully chosen to contain primarily wastewater of permanent residential areas  rather than industry or hospitals. We used RT-PCR and sequencing to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Munich population with temporo-spatial resolution. The study became fully operational in mid-April 2020 and has been tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA load weekly for one year. Sequencing of the isolated viral RNA was performed to obtain information about the presence and abundance of variants of concern in the Munich area over time. We demonstrate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads  between <7.5 and 3874 mL  in these different areas within Munich correlates well with official seven day incidence notification data  between 0.0 and 327 per 100 000  obtained from the authorities within the respective region. Wastewater viral loads predicted the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 local incidence about 3 weeks in advance of data based on respiratory swab analyses. Aligning with multiple different point-mutations characteristic for certain variants of concern  we could demonstrate the gradual increase of variant of concern B.1.1.7 in the Munich population beginning in January 2021  weeks before it became apparent in sequencing results of swabs samples taken from patients living in Munich. Overall  the study highlights the potential of WBE to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  including the introduction of variants of concern in a local population.

Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have shown worrisome effects on vaccine and treatment efficacy  but no current point-of-care  POC  testing modality allows their specific identification. We have developed miSHERLOCK  a low-cost  CRISPR-based POC diagnostic platform that takes unprocessed patient saliva; extracts  purifies  and concentrates viral RNA; performs amplification and detection reactions; and provides fluorescent visual output with only three user actions and 1 hour from sample input to answer out. miSHERLOCK achieves highly sensitive multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations associated with variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. Our modular system enables easy exchange of assays to address diverse user needs and can be rapidly reconfigured to detect different viruses and variants of concern. An adjunctive smartphone application enables output quantification  automated interpretation  and the possibility of remote  distributed result reporting.

METHODS: : We initiated SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in 18 secondary schools across six regions in September 2020. Participants provided nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning  September 2020  and end  December 2020  of the autumn term and at the start of the spring term  March 2021 . FINDINGS: : In March 2021  1895 participants  1100 students:795 staff  were tested; 5.6%  61 1094  students and 4.4%  35 792  staff had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from December 2020-March 2021. Nucleoprotein-antibody seroprevalence was 36.3%  370 1018  in students and 31.9%  245 769  in staff  while spike-antibody prevalence was 39.5%  402 1018  and 59.8%  459 769   respectively  similar to regional community seroprevalence. Between December 2020 and March 2021  14.8%  97 656; 95%CI: 12.2-17.7  students and 10.0%  59 590; 95%CI: 7.7-12.7  staff seroconverted.

We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]   the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of [Formula: see text] relates to a herd immunity threshold  HIT   which is given by [Formula: see text]. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold  sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely  barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity . Here  we report state-level [Formula: see text] estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming  indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. [Formula: see text] estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21 January 2020 to 21 June 2020. Our [Formula: see text] estimates characterize the infectiousness of ancestral strains  but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct  currently dominant circulating strain  such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta  lineage B.1.617.2   if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs  vaccination data  and seroprevalence survey data  we found that no state had achieved herd immunity as of 20 September 2021.

OBJECTIVE: In this study  we evaluated the analytical performance of the Allplex™SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV assay for the additional presumptive identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a real-life setting. RESULTS: We observed gene-specific changes in the cycle threshold  Ct  of the N and RdRp genes compared with the Ct yielded for the S gene when the SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed Allplex™SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV assay. Seventeen samples showed Ct variations in the N and or RdRp. In 10 cases  the N gene was affected  delayed or negative and in 14 cases  the RdRp gene showed a delay or negative concerning the S gene. A delay in the Ct of both genes  RdRp and N  was observed in six cases. Sequencing determined that all samples identified as B.1.1.7 showed changes in the PCR curves of the N and RdRp. However  samples identified as B.1.177 only showed variations for the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS: Allplex™SARS-CoV-2 FluA FluB RSV assay  the diagnosis could presumably allow the rapid assignment of lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.177  and emphasizes the importance of exhaustive surveillance for circulating variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to reduce community transmission.

METHODS: Using the single B cell cloning technology  we isolated and characterized 93 RBD-specific antibodies from the memory B cells of four COVID-19 convalescent individuals in the early stage of the pandemic. Then  global RBD alanine scanning with a panel of 19 selected neutralizing antibodies  NAbs   including several broadly reactive NAbs  was performed. Furthermore  we assessed the impact of single natural mutation or co-mutations of concern at key positions of RBD on the neutralization escape and ACE2 binding function by recombinant proteins and pseudoviruses. RESULTS: Thirty-three amino acid positions within four independent antigenic sites  1 to 4  of RBD were identified as valuable indicators of antigenic changes in the RBD. The comprehensive escape mutation map not only confirms the widely circulating strains carrying important immune escape RBD mutations such as K417N  E484K  and L452R  but also facilitates the discovery of new immune escape-enabling mutations such as F486L  N450K  F490S  and R346S. Of note  these escape mutations could not affect the ACE2 binding affinity of RBD  among which L452R even enhanced binding. Furthermore  we showed that RBD co-mutations K417N  E484K  and N501Y present in B.1.351 appear more resistant to NAbs and human convalescent plasma from the early stage of the pandemic  possibly due to an additive effect. Conversely  double mutations E484Q and L452R present in B.1.617.1 variant show partial antibody evasion with no evidence for an additive effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a global view of the determinants for neutralizing antibody recognition  antigenic conservation  and RBD conformation. The in-depth escape maps may have value for prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants. Special attention should be paid to the accumulation of co-mutations at distinct major antigenic sites. Finally  the new broadly reactive NAbs described here represent new potential opportunities for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

The further development remains to be determined. METHODS: We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases  mean age 44 ± 13.2 years. Except for one participant in whom rheumatoid arthritis existed  all other cases were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2–10 weeks  3 months  6 months  and 12 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies  NAb  against wild type at 6 and 12 months and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants at month 12. Three binding antibody assays were used  targeting the nucleocapsid protein  NCP   the S1 subunit of the spike protein  and the receptor binding domain  RBD . RESULTS: Antibodies to the RBD persisted for 12 months in all cases with increasing concentrations  whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below cut-off point in 7 participants and NCP antibodies were above cut-off point in only 5 subjects at month 12. The NAb against wild type were detected in all but 2 samples at 12 months of follow-up but clearly less frequently when targeting the variants. In 5 participants who were vaccinated against COVID-19 there was a strong increase of antibodies against S1 and RBD as well as an increase of NAb titres against wild type and the variants. CONCLUSION: There was a persisting antibody response against SARS-CoV‑2 up to 12 months after COVID-19 with declining concentrations except for RBD and a strong increase of all antibody concentrations after vaccination.

Compared with D614G  the emerging variants exhibited increased affinity for the receptor  ACE2  and increased ability to infect cells with low ACE2 levels. All variants lost infectivity similarly at room temperature and 37°C; however  in the cold  B.1.1.7 was more stable  and P.1 and B.1.1.248 were less stable. Shedding of the S1 glycoprotein from the spike contributed to virus inactivation in the cold. B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.1.248 were neutralized by convalescent and vaccinee sera less efficiently than the other variants. Spike glycoprotein properties such as requirements for ACE2 levels on the target cell  functional stability in the cold and resistance to host neutralizing antibodies potentially contribute to the outgrowth of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The role of pets  especially domestic dogs  in the COVID‐19 epidemiology is highly questionable and needs further investigation. In this study  we report a case of COVID‐19 in a French dog living in close contact with its owners who were COVID‐19 patients. The dog presented rhinitis and was sampled 1 week after its owners  a man and a woman  were tested positive for COVID‐19. The nasal swabs for the dog tested remained positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by reverse transcription quantitative real‐time PCR  RT‐qPCR  1 month following the first diagnosis. Specific anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were detectable 12 days after the first diagnosis and persisted for at least 5 months as tested using enzyme‐linked immunoassay  ELISA  and automated western blotting. The whole‐genome sequences from the dog and its owners were 99%–100% identical  with the man and the woman's sequences  respectively  and matched the B.1.160 variant of concern  Marseille‐4 variant   the most widespread in France at the time the dog was infected. This study documents the first detection of B.1.160 in pets  a dog  in France  and the first canine genome recovery of the B.1.160 variant of global concern. Moreover  given the enhanced infectivity and transmissibility of the Marseille‐4 variant for humans  this case also highlights the risk that pets may potentially play a significant role in SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreaks and may transmit the infection to humans. We have evidence of human‐to‐dog transmission of the Marseille‐4 variant since the owners were first to be infected. Finally  owners and veterinarians must be vigilent for canine COVID‐19 when dogs are presented with respiratory clinical signs.

METHODS: 396 residents from seven NHs suffering a SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7  VOC‐α  outbreak at least 14 days after a vaccine campaign were repeatedly tested using SARS‐CoV‐2 real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab test  RT‐qPCR . SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of the S1 subunit  RBD‐IgG  was measured in all residents. Nucleocapsid antigenemia  N‐Ag  was measured in RT‐qPCR‐positive residents and serum neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated residents from one NH. RESULTS: The incidence of positive RT‐qPCR was lower in residents vaccinated by two doses  72 317; 22.7%  vs one dose  10 31; 32.3%  or non‐vaccinated residents  21 48; 43.7%; p < .01 . COVID‐19–induced deaths were observed in 5 of the 48 non‐vaccinated residents  10.4%   in 2 of the 31 who had received one dose  6.4%   and in 3 of the 317  0.9%  who had received two doses  p = .0007 . Severe symptoms were more common in infected non‐vaccinated residents  10 21; 47.6%  than in infected vaccinated residents  15 72; 21.0%; p = .002 . Higher levels of RBD‐IgG  n = 325  were associated with a lower SARS‐CoV‐2 incidence. No in vitro serum neutralization activity was found for RBD‐IgG levels below 1050 AU ml. RBD‐IgG levels were inversely associated with N‐Ag levels  found as a risk factor of severe COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Two BNT162b2 doses are associated with a 48% reduction of SARS‐CoV‐2 incidence and a 91.3% reduction of death risk in residents from NHs facing a VOC‐α outbreak. Post‐vaccine RBD‐IgG levels correlate with BNT162b2 protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7.

It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2. We measured neutralising antibody responses following a single immunization using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain  9 out of 10   the Receptor Binding Motif  RBM   5 out of 31   but not in neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect newly emerging viruses in the UK led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs  19 out of 31  over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. E484K emergence on a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the vaccine BNT162b.

Neurological symptoms associated with COVID‐19 include anosmia  ageusia  headaches  confusion  delirium  and strokes. These may manifest due to viral entry into the central nervous system  CNS  through the blood–brain barrier  BBB  by means of ill‐defined mechanisms. Here  we summarize the abilities of SARS‐CoV‐2 and other neurotropic RNA viruses  including Zika virus and Nipah virus  to cross the BBB into the CNS  highlighting the role of magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  in assessing presence and severity of brain structural changes in COVID‐19 patients. We present new insight into key mutations in SARS‐CoV‐2 variants B.1.1.7  P681H  and B.1.617.2  P681R   which may impact on neuropilin 1  NRP1  binding and CNS invasion. We postulate that SARS‐CoV‐2 may infect both peripheral cells capable of crossing the BBB and brain endothelial cells to traverse the BBB and spread into the brain. COVID‐19 patients can be followed up with MRI modalities to better understand the long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on the brain.

To investigate the potential protective effect of the recombinant protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine targeting receptor-binding domain  RBD   PS-RBD  and whole inactivated virus particle vaccine  IV  against the variant strains  in this study  rhesus macaques were immunized with PS-RBD or IV vaccine  followed by a Beta variant  B.1.351  challenge. Although neutralizing activity against the Beta variant was reduced compared with that against the prototype  the decreased viral load in both upper and lower respiratory tracts  milder pathological changes  and downregulated inflammatory cytokine levels in lung tissues after challenge demonstrated that PS-RBD and IV still provided effective protection against the Beta variant in the macaque model. Furthermore  PS-RBD-induced macaque sera possessed general binding and neutralizing activity to Alpha  Beta  Delta  and Omicron variants in our study  though the neutralizing antibody  NAb  titers declined by varying degrees  demonstrating potential protection of PS-RBD against current circulating variants of concern  VOCs . Interestingly  although the IV vaccine-induced extremely low neutralizing antibody titers against the Beta variant  it still showed reduction for viral load and significantly alleviated pathological change. Other correlates of vaccine-induced protection  CoP  like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity  ADCC  and immune memory were both confirmed to be existing in IV vaccinated group and possibly be involved in the protective mechanism.

Due to the paucity of SARS‐CoV‐2 complete genome sequencing  we established a Network for Pandemic Alert of Emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 Variants to rapidly understand and monitor the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants into the state. Through analysis of 210 SARS‐CoV‐2 complete genomes obtained from the largest regional health departments we identified cocirculation of multiple SARS‐CoV‐2 lineages such as B.1.1  0.5%   B.1.1.28  23.2%   B.1.1.7  alpha variant  6.2%   B.1.566  1.4%   B.1.544  0.5%   C.37  0.5%  P.1  gamma variant  66.2%   and P.2  zeta variant  1.0% .

Using molecular modeling tools to search for a good binding drugs we identified SANC00944  SANC01032  SANC00992  and SANC00317 from South African natural compounds database as potential inhibitor of the Spike-ACE2 complex. In sum  this study will help in the design and discovery of novel drug therapeutics  which may be used against the emerging Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  virus continues to inflict chaos globally. The emergence of a novel Omicron variant  B.1.1.529  in South Africa harbors 30 mutations in the spike protein. The variant is distinguished from other variants of concern  VOCs  with an increased  15  number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and suggests higher chances of causing reinfections. Initial reports also claimed that this variant escapes all the neutralizing antibodies  thus demanding a novel strategy against it. Thus  in this study  we performed a computational molecular screening against the RBD of the Omicron  B.1.1.529  variant and assessed the binding affinity of potent drugs against the RBD. The multi-steps screening of the South African Natural Compounds Database  SANCDB  revealed four medicinal compounds as excellent  potential  anti-viral agents against the Omicron variant  namely SANC00944  SANC01032  SANC00992  and SANC00317. The simulation analysis of these compounds in complex with the RBD demonstrated stable dynamics and structural compactness. Moreover  the residual flexibility analysis revealed that the flexibility of three loops required for interaction with hACE2 has been reduced by the binding of these drugs. The post-simulation validation of these compounds such as binding free energy  in silico bioactivity  and dissociation constant prediction validated the anti-viral potency of these compounds. The total binding free energy  TBFE  for the SANC01032–RBD complex was reported to be −46.54 kcal mol; for the SANC01032–RBD complex  the TBFE was −41.88 kcal mol; for the SANC00992–RBD complex the TBFE was −29.05 kcal mol  while for the SANC00317–RBD complex the TBFE was −31.03 kcal mol. The results showed the inhibition potential of these compounds by targeting the RBD. In conclusion  this study will help in the design and discovery of novel drug therapeutics  which may be used against the emerging Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Recently  several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Several antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2 TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line  Calu-1  against the first wave  B.1  lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.617.2. Several clinically used antidepressants  including fluoxetine  citalopram  reboxetine  imipramine  as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine  flupenthixol  and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast  the anticonvulsant carbamazepine  and novel antidepressants ketamine  known as anesthetic at high doses  and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram  respectively  showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore  fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations  N501Y  K417N  and E484K  as well as B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   and B.1.617.2  delta  variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern  however  extensive clinical studies must be performed to confirm our in vitro findings.

Plasma samples collected in 2020 before emergence of variants showed reduced titers against the Alpha variants  and both sets of samples demonstrated significantly reduced titers against Beta. Comparison of microneutralization titers with those obtained with pseudotype and hemagglutination tests showed a good correlation between their titers and effects of strain variation  supporting the use of these simpler assays for assessing the potency of convalescent plasma against currently circulating and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2.

There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays  we screened 146 COVID-19 patients’ plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution. RESULTS: We identified linear epitopes from the spike  S  and nucleocapsid  N  proteins and showed that the epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than the S or N protein antigen. Specifically  we found that antibody responses to the S-811–825  S-881–895  and N-156–170 epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover  we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant of concern B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes. CONCLUSION: Epitope-resolved antibody testing not only affords a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies  but it also may potentially be used to predict clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants of concern in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

Herein  we utilized an established nationwide system of wastewater sampling and viral concentration approaches to perform large-scale surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in nine different locations across Israel that were sampled from August 2020 to February 2021 and sequenced  n=58 . Viral sequences obtained from the wastewater samples had high coverages of the genome  and mutation analyses successfully identified the penetration of the B.1.1.7 variant into Israel in December 2020 in the central and north regions  and its spread into additional regions in January and February 2021  corresponding with clinical sampling results. Moreover  the wastewater analysis identified the B.1.1.7 variant in December 2020 in regions in which non-sufficient clinical sampling was available. Other variants of concern examined  including P.1  Brazil Manaus   B.1.429  USA California   B.1.526  USA New York   A.23.1  Uganda  and B.1.525  Unknown origin   did not show consistently elevated frequencies. This study exemplifies that surveillance by sewage is a robust approach which allows to monitor the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the community. Most importantly  this approach can pre-identify the emergence of epidemiologically or clinically relevant mutations variants  aiding in public health decision making.

The World Health Organization has listed three variants  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1  as variants of concern. To understand the epidemiology and thereby plan appropriate safety measures  differential identification of the variants is indeed critical. Objectives: Although whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for variant identification  it is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Therefore  a rapid  easy  and cost-effective platform targeting multiple regions of the genome is required. Here  we assessed the usefulness of the Novaplex TM  SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay kit in identifying mutations in the variants. Study design: We retrospectively examined 30 stored nasal swabs from COVID-19-positive patients tested between November 2020 and March 2021. RNA extracted from these swabs was subjected to the commercial kit and real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed. To determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the collected samples and deduce the consensus sequences among the identified variants  genome sequencing libraries were prepared and mapped to the reference genome. Results: Four of the tested samples were determined as variants. Of them  two harbored both H69 V70 deletion and N501Y substitution  whereas two harbored E484K substitution alone. Conclusions: The variant with E484K substitution alone  “R.1”  has been now categorized as a variant of interest in Japan. Additionally  the kit-based assay was found to be feasible  convenient  and user-friendly in identifying the abovementioned mutations with a turnaround time of only 2 hours.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has improved diagnosis in detection the viral lineages especially involving sporadic infection. The combination of short- and long-reads greatly improved the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and marked as a new approach to correct erroneous frame-shifts from single sequencing effort. Methods & Materials The samples were recovered from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens of symptomatic health-care worker. The viral RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR and constructed for genomic library according to the ARTIC nCoV-2019 protocol. We performed whole-genome sequencing using hybrid approach combining both short and long-read sequencing approaches  respectively. The raw reads were reconstructed using a combination of bioinformatic tools for trimming  assembly and annotation. Finally  the consensus sequence was mapped with Geneious mapper using default parameters. Results The hybrid approach resulted in a 29 782bp complete whole-genome with GC content of 38%. The product was deposited to GISAID as hCov-19 Malaysia IIUM316 2020  and was identified to be originated from B.6 lineage of clade O. Besides  we observed several mutational points such as M153I  spike   P13L  N   T1198K  NSP3   L37F  NSP6   and A97V  NSP12   which may representing the major contributor to early pandemic transmission in Malaysia. Conclusion The present study highlights the utility of whole-genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool of evaluating sporadic pattern of infection that can help to provide information regarding viruses relatedness  mutational rate  geographical spread and host adaptation. High-quality genome data can be used to assist in epidemiological investigation particularly when combined with other types of data.

She initially was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in September 2020 during an outbreak in her nursing home. On this occasion  she again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our case report describes the resident’s poor immune response indicated by a low IgG level after her initial COVID infection as well as reinfection with a ‘non-variant’ SARS-CoV-2 lineage  B.1.177 . The case describes the importance of integration of community and secondary care. The nursing home received close monitoring and nurse supervision for the detection of potential deterioration of the patient. Exit-seeking behaviour by nursing home residents was limited effectively. The issues of low immune response to COVID-19 in older people and the emergence of variants of concern will continue to pose a threat to this susceptible group.

Methods: We analyzed 348 Swedish SARS-CoV-2 sequences freely available from GISAID obtained from 7 February 2020 until 14 May 2020. Results: We identified 14 variant sites ≥5% frequency in the population. Among those sites  the D936Y substitution in the viral Spike protein was under positive selection. The variant sites can distinguish 11 mutational profiles in Sweden. Nine of the profiles appeared in Stockholm in March 2020. Mutational profiles 3  B.1.1  and 6  B.1   which contain the D936Y mutation  became the predominant profiles over time  spreading from Stockholm to other Swedish regions during April and the beginning of May. Furthermore  Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could have emerged in Sweden on 27 December 2019  and community transmission started on February 1st with an evolutionary rate of 1.5425 × 10 −3  substitutions per year. Conclusions: Our study provides novel knowledge on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Swedish SARS-CoV-2 variants during the early pandemic. Characterization of these viral variants can provide precious insights on viral pathogenesis and can be valuable for diagnostic and drug development approaches.

Initial reports suggest that the Omicron variant is more transmissible and resistant to vaccine neutralization but causes less severe illness compared with previous variants  1-3 . To describe characteristics of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods of Delta and Omicron predominance  clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively ed from the electronic health records  EHRs  of adults aged >=18 years with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  SARS-CoV-2 test results admitted to one academic hospital in Los Angeles  California  during July 15-September 23  2021  Delta predominant period  339 patients  and December 21  2021-January 27  2022  Omicron predominant period  737 patients . Compared with patients during the period of Delta predominance  a higher proportion of adults admitted during Omicron predominance had received the final dose in a primary COVID-19 vaccination series  were fully vaccinated   39.6% versus 25.1%   and fewer received COVID-19-directed therapies. Although fewer required intensive care unit  ICU  admission and invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   and fewer died while hospitalized during Omicron predominance  there were no significant differences in ICU admission or IMV when stratified by vaccination status. Fewer fully vaccinated Omicron-period patients died while hospitalized  3.4%   compared with Delta-period patients  10.6% . Among Omicron-period patients  vaccination was associated with lower likelihood of ICU admission  and among adults aged >=65 years  lower likelihood of death while hospitalized. Likelihood of ICU admission and death were lowest among adults who had received a booster dose. Among the first 131 Omicron-period hospitalizations  19.8% of patients were clinically assessed as admitted for non-COVID-19 conditions. Compared with adults considered likely to have been admitted because of COVID-19  these patients were younger  median age = 38 versus 67 years  and more likely to have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine  84.6% versus 61.0% . Although 20% of SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalizations during the period of Omicron predominance might be driven by non-COVID-19 conditions  large numbers of hospitalizations place a strain on health systems. Vaccination  including a booster dose for those who are fully vaccinated  remains critical to minimizing risk for severe health outcomes among adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We used 187 B.1.429 variant sequences from Hawai’i deposited in the GenBank and GISAID as of March 20  2021  as an example to develop the methodology. Briefly  i  acquire sequences  ii  perform multiple sequence alignment  iii  trim the alignment  iv  remove incomplete sequences  v  remove duplicates  and vi  generate a phylogenetic tree. The tree defined the most recent common ancestor as the origin. Further  the multiple sequence alignment used to generate the phylogenetic tree identified 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the B.1.429 variant genome. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines B.1.429 as a variant initially found in California. This variant was introduced in Hawai’i multiple times in early 2021. Based on the phylogenetic tree  we conclude that the B.1.429 variant has entered Hawai’i at different timepoints from at least seven different states in the continental United States. This information provides a tool for policy makers and public health officials in applying precision public health genomics.

Despite its outbreak in December 2019–January 2020  a few continents and countries such as India started to experience a significant number of COVID-19-positive cases from March 2020. GISAID clade variation analysis in the period March 2020–February 2021  period I  and March 2021–first week of April 2021  period II  showed a rapid variation of SARS-CoV-2 in all continents and India over time. Studying the relationship of patient age or gender with viral clades in these two periods revealed that the population under 10 years of age was the least affected  whereas the 11–60-year-old population was the most affected  irrespective of patient gender and ethnicity. In the first wave  India registered quite a low number of COVID-19-positive cases million people  but the scenario unexpectedly changed in the second wave  when even over 400 000 confirmed cases day were reported. Lineage analysis in India showed the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants  i.e.  B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2  during April–May 2021  which might be one of the key reasons for the sudden upsurge of confirmed cases day. Furthermore  the emergence of the new variants contributed to the shift in infection spread by the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 from 46% in period II to 82.34% by the end of May 2021. Along with the management of the emergence of new variants  few factors viz.  lockdown and vaccination were also accountable for controlling the upsurge of new COVID-19 cases throughout the country. Collectively  a comparative analysis of the scenario of the first wave with that of the second wave would suggest policymakers the way to prepare for better management of COVID-19 recurrence or its severity in India and other countries.

Recently  viral mutants termed variants of concern  VOC  which may escape host immunity have emerged. The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines  CVnCoV and CV2CoV  against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable  but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs  lung  or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1  CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.

METHODS: Functional characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune immunoglobulin  hIG  from human convalescent plasma was performed by different virus neutralization methodologies  plaque reduction  virus induced cytotoxicity  TCID 50  reduction and immunofluorimetry  at different laboratories using geographically different SARS-CoV-2 isolates  USA  1   Italy  1   Spain  2 : 2 containing the D614G mutation . Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants  D614G mutant  B.1.1.7  P.1 and B.1.351  was evaluated using a pseudovirus expressing the corresponding spike  S  protein. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity  ADCC  and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  ADCP  was also evaluated. RESULTS: All SARS-CoV-2 isolates were potently neutralized by hIG as shown by all four methodologies. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively neutralized using the pseudovirus. hIG induced ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins but not E protein. Very low concentrations  25-100 µg IgG mL  were required. A potent effect was triggered by antibodies in hIG solutions against the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond neutralization  IgG Fc-dependent pathways may play a role in combatting SARS-CoV-2 infections using COVID-19 hIG. This could be especially relevant for the treatment of more neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Tracing genomic variations and understanding their impact on the viral properties are the foundations for the vaccine and drug development and for the mitigation measures to be taken or lifted. In this study  1 051 near-complete genomes and 1 559 spike  S  sequences belonging to the B.1.617 were analyzed. A genome-wide spread of single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  was identified. Of the high frequency mutations identified  61%  11 18  involved structural proteins  despite two third of the viral genome encoding nonstructural proteins. There were 22 positive selection sites  mostly distributed across the S protein  of which 16 were led by non-C to U transition and should be of a special attention. Haplotype network revealed that a large number of daughter haplotypes were continually derived throughout the pandemic  of which H177  H181 H219 and H286 from the ancestor haplotype H176 of B.1.617.2 were widely prevalent. Besides the well known substitutions of L452R  P681R and deletions of E156 and F157  as well as the potential biological significance  structural analysis in this study still indicated that new amino acid changes in B.1.617  such as E484Q and N501Y  had reshaped the viral bonding network  and increasingly sequenced N501Y mutant with a potential enhanced binding ability was detected in many other countries in the follow-up monitoring. Although we can’t conclude the properties of all the mutants including N501Y thoroughly  it merits focusing on their spread epidemically and biologically.

STUDY DESIGN: Time series analysis. METHODS: Time series analysis of the daily number of COVID-19 deaths was performed using non-linear Poisson mixed regression models. Variables such as variants’ frequency  demographics  climate  health  and mobility characteristics of thirty-two countries between January 2020 and April 2021 were considered as potentially relevant adjustment factors. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that vaccination efficacy in terms of protection against deaths was 72%  with a lower reduction of the number of deaths for B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7 variants  70% and 78%  respectively . Other factors significantly related to mortality were arrivals at airports  mobility change from the prepandemic level  and temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a strong effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination based on real-life public data  although lower than expected from clinical trials. This suggests the absence of indirect protection for non-vaccinated individuals. Results also show that vaccination effectiveness against mortality associated with the B.1.1.7 variant is slightly lower than that with other variants. Lastly  this analysis confirms the role of mobility reduction  within and between countries  as an effective way to reduce COVID-19 mortality and suggests the possibility of seasonal variations in COVID-19 incidence.

METHODS: The study is a descriptive type and VOC PCR from all samples  from a total of 1300 samples  which detected positive by conventional PCR in a training and research hospital COVID test center between February 2 and 9  2021. The United Kingdom mutation  VOC 202012 01  B.1.1.7  has been studied. Clinics parameters of the patients were evaluated from Public Health Management System  HSYS  records. The statistical significance was taken as p<0.05 in the analysis. RESULTS: Within the scope of the research  1300 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients were evaluated. VOC mutation was positive in 26.1% of all patients  339 persons   and 5.8% of patients  75 persons  were hospitalized. While 3.2%  11 persons  of those with VOC positivity were hospitalized  6.7%  64 persons  of VOC negatives were hospitalized  p=0.020 . About 18.2% of hospitalized VOC positives  two persons  and 23.4% of VOC negatives  15 persons  are in intensive care. CONCLUSION: When VOC mutation was examined in all admitted and hospitalized patients  it was detected that VOC mutation was less frequent in hospitalized patients. No relationship between hospitalization and intensive care stay and VOC mutation was detected. It is recommended to determine with studies the contagiousness of patients with VOC mutations.

Apart from clinical relevance and containment  for specific questions  it might be of interest to  re investigate cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load  where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results  even though these cases might neither be clinically relevant nor significant for containment measures  because they might probably not be infectious. In order to expand the diagnostic bandwidth for non-routine questions  particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens associated with high C T  values  we combined the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This expansion can help to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections without the demand of confirmative antibody testing  which requires to summon patients again for blood sampling few to several weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics. This allows a reliable interpretation of RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR. After laboratory implementation  we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers  n=769 . Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 5 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases  mainly exhibiting mild and heterogeneous presentation—apart from a single case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  MIS-C  associated with SARS-CoV-2  who was hospitalized in the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. The tested biotinylated primers do not negatively affect the RT-qPCR pipeline and thus can be optionally applied to enable deeper inspection of RT-qPCR results by subsequent pyrosequencing. Moreover  due to the incremental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  we note that the used strategy can uncover  Spike  P681H allowing the pre-selection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 candidate specimens for deep sequencing.

Determining what factors shape fitness at the host population-level is especially challenging because both intrinsic factors like pathogen genetics and extrinsic factors such as host behavior influence between-host transmission potential. This challenge has been highlighted by controversy surrounding the population-level fitness effects of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their relative importance when compared against non-genetic factors shaping transmission dynamics. Building upon phylodynamic birth–death models  we develop a new framework to learn how hundreds of genetic and non-genetic factors have shaped the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate the fitness effects of all amino acid variants and several structural variants that have circulated in the United States between February 2020 and March 2021 from viral phylogenies. We also estimate how much fitness variation among pathogen lineages is attributable to genetic versus non-genetic factors such as spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. Before September 2020  most fitness variation between lineages can be explained by background spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates across geographic regions. Starting in late 2020  genetic variation in fitness increased dramatically with the emergence of several new lineages including B.1.1.7  B.1.427  B.1.429 and B.1.526. Our analysis also indicates that genetic variants in less well-explored genomic regions outside of Spike may be contributing significantly to overall fitness variation in the viral population.

The two variants  namely the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  Alpha  and P.1  Gamma   were formed by the mutations in the receptor binding domain of spike glycoprotein  SGP . These two variants are known to possess a high binding affinity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Amidst the rapid spread of these mutant strains  research and development of novel molecules become tedious and labour-intensive. Imidazole and benzimidazole scaffolds were selected in this study based on their unique structural features and electron-rich environment  resulting in increased affinity against a variety of therapeutic targets. In the current study  imidazole- and benzimidazole-based anti-parasitic drugs are repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Gamma variant spike glycoproteins using computational strategies. Out of the screened 15 molecules  flubendazole and mebendazole have exhibited promising binding features to the two receptors  PDB ID: 7NEH and 7NXC   as evidenced by their glide score and binding free energy. The results are compared with that of the two standard drugs  remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Flubendazole and mebendazole have become convenient treatment options against mutant lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The edge of the flubendazole was further established by its stability in MD simulation conducted for 100 ns employing GROMACS software. Further  in vitro and in vivo studies are essential to understand  if flubendazole and mebendazole indeed hold the promise to manage SARS-CoV-2 mutant stains.

The N501Y mutation within the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein of these SARS‐CoV‐2 variants may enhance binding to the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2  hACE2 . However  no molecular explanation for such an enhanced affinity has so far been provided. Here  using all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations  we show that Y501 in the mutated RBD can be well‐coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions  which may increase the overall binding affinity of the RBD for hACE2 by approximately 0.81 kcal·mol −1 . The binding dynamics revealed in our study may provide a working model to facilitate the design of more effective antibodies.

Some of these new variants  such as B.1.351 and B.1.1.17  manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants  with potential dramatic effects on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. So far  analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on point nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast  insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the spike protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence and other inserts might have contributed to coronavirus pathogenicity as well. Here  we investigate insertions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identify 141 unique inserts of different lengths. We present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing errors. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes  polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. We show that inserts in the Spike glycoprotein can affect its antigenic properties and thus have to be monitored. At least  two inserts in the N-terminal domain of the Spike  ins246DSWG and ins15ATLRI  that were first detected in January 2021 are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity.

Neutralizing antibodies  nAbs  have great potential for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study  ten nAbs were isolated from two phage-display immune libraries constructed from the pooled PBMCs of eight COVID-19 convalescent patients. Eight of them  consisting of heavy chains encoded by the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene-variable region  IGHV 3-66 or IGHV3-53 genes  recognized the same epitope on the receptor-binding domain  RBD   while the remaining two bound to different epitopes. Among the ten antibodies  2B11 exhibited the highest affinity and neutralization potency against the original wild-type  WT  SARS-CoV-2 virus  K D  = 4.76 nM for the S1 protein  IC 50  = 6 ng mL for pseudoviruses  and IC 50  = 1 ng mL for authentic viruses   and potent neutralizing ability against B.1.1.7 pseudoviruses. Furthermore  1E10  targeting a distinct epitope on RBD  exhibited different neutralization efficiency against WT SARS-CoV-2 and its variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1. The crystal structure of the 2B11–RBD complexes revealed that the epitope of 2B11 highly overlaps with the ACE2-binding site. The in vivo experiment of 2B11 using AdV5-hACE2-transduced mice showed encouraging therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together  our results suggest that the highly potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody  2B11  could be used against the WT SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 variant  or in combination with a different epitope-targeted neutralizing antibody  such as 1E10  against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In addition  ACE2-Fc-TD displays greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype viruses compared to a dimeric ACE2-Fc  with enhanced activity on variant B.1.351. This tetrameric decoy protein would be a valuable addition to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic approaches  especially where vaccination cannot be used but also should there be any future coronavirus pandemics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this issue  we conducted a prospective  multi-center study of 58 adult KTRs receiving mRNA-BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. We used multiple complementary non-invasive biomarkers for rejection monitoring including serum creatinine  proteinuria  donor-derived cell-free DNA  peripheral blood gene expression profile  PBGEP   urinary CXCL9 mRNA and de novo donor-specific antibodies  DSA . Secondary outcomes included development of anti-viral immune responses against the wild-type and Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: At a median of 85 days  no KTRs developed de novo DSAs and only one patient developed acute rejection following recent conversion to belatacept  which was associated with increased creatinine and urinary CXCL9 levels. During follow-up  there were no significant changes in proteinuria  donor-derived cell-free DNA levels or PBGEP. 36% of KTRs in our cohort developed anti-wild-type spike antibodies  75% and 55% of whom had neutralizing responses against wild-type and Delta variants respectively. A cellular response against wild-type S1  measured by interferon-γ-ELISpot assay  developed in 38% of KTRs. Cellular responses did not differ in KTRs with or without antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in KTRs did not elicit a significant alloimmune response. About half of KTRs who develop anti-wild-type spike antibodies after two mRNA vaccine doses have neutralizing responses against the Delta variant. There was no association between anti-viral humoral and cellular responses.

Here  we have devised a bioinformatic pipeline that inputs SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in FASTA FASTQ format and outputs a single Variant Calling Format file that can be processed to obtain variant annotations and perform downstream population genetic testing. As proof of concept  we have analyzed over 229 000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences up until November 30  2020. We have identified over 39 000 variants worldwide with increased polymorphisms  spanning the ORF3a gene as well as the 3′ untranslated  UTR  regions  specifically in the conserved stem loop region of SARS-CoV-2 which is accumulating greater observed viral diversity relative to chance variation. Our analysis pipeline has also discovered the existence of SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation with low frequency  less than in 2% of genomes  likely arising through host immune responses and not due to sequencing errors. Among annotated non-sense variants with a population frequency over 1%  recurrent inactivation of the ORF8 gene was found. This was found to be present in the newly identified B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage that originated in the United Kingdom. Almost all VOC-containing genomes possess one stop codon in ORF8 gene  Q27 ∗    however  13% of these genomes also contains another stop codon  K68 ∗    suggesting that ORF8 loss does not interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spread and may play a role in its increased virulence. We have developed this computational pipeline to assist researchers in the rapid analysis and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variation.

We found that the four infected staff members accounted for 5.3% of all 75 infected persons  approximately one of 10 the percentage of other Japanese hospitals that experienced disease clusters caused by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 until January 2021. Furthermore  none of the infected staff developed COVID-19. Nationwide vaccination began in February 2021  when wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection remained prevalent in Japan. During March-May  Sapporo had already experienced an explosive increase in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 cases. JCHO Sapporo Hokushin Hospital started optional vaccination for staff members using BNT162b2. The first inoculations occurred between February 22  2021  and April 28  2021  and the second between March 15  2021  and May 7  2021. This is the first report that BNT162b2 might reduce B.1.1.7 variant transmission in Japanese population.

In early January 2021  a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages  B.1.427 and B.1.429  was originally detected in California  CA  and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence  transmissibility  and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1  614G   with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1.  614G  and B.1.427 infections. In addition  subgenomic viral RNA  sgRNA  levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429  however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1  614G  or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments  we found that B.1.  614G   epsilon  B.1.427 B.1.429  and gamma  P.1  dramatically outcompete alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351  and zeta  P.2  in the lungs. In the nasal cavity  B.1.  614G   gamma  and epsilon dominate  but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427  B.1.429 and ancestral B.1  614G  and WA-1 variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative oropharyngeal replication of the epsilon  B.1.427 B.1.429  variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1  614G  variant.

Wastewater-based epidemiology  WBE   which uses nucleic acid amplification tests to detect viral fragments  is a reliable proxy of COVID-19 incidence and prevalence  and thus offers the potential to monitor VOC viral load in a given population. Here  we describe and validate a primer extension PCR strategy targeting a signature mutation in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2. This allows quantification of B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7 allele frequency in wastewater without the need to employ quantitative RT-PCR standard curves. We show that the wastewater B.1.1.7 profile correlates with its clinical counterpart and benefits from a near real-time and facile data collection and reporting pipeline. This assay can be quickly implemented within a current SARS-CoV-2 WBE framework with minimal cost; allowing early and contemporaneous estimates of B.1.1.7 community transmission prior to  or in lieu of  clinical screening and identification. Our study demonstrates that this strategy can provide public health units with an additional and much needed tool to rapidly triangulate VOC incidence prevalence with high sensitivity and lineage specificity.

Here  we test whether intra-host virus evolution during persistent infections could be a contributing factor by characterizing the long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in an immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipient. Applying RT-qPCR and next-generation sequencing  NGS  of sequential respiratory specimens  we identify several mutations in the viral genome late in infection. We demonstrate that a late viral isolate exhibiting genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK  South Africa  and Brazil  can escape neutralization by COVID-19 antisera. Moreover  infection of susceptible mice with this patient’s escape variant elicits protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus and the escape variant  as well as high neutralization titers against the alpha and beta SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  demonstrating a considerable immune control against such variants of concern. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment  the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection. Our results suggest that immunocompromised patients could be a source for the emergence of potentially harmful SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Recent history involving SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks have demonstrated the significant role of intermediate hosts in viral maintenance and transmission. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species has been demonstrated  and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer  WTD  are amongst the most abundant and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the US. Recently  WTD fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study  we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult WTD. In addition  we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates  representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the alpha variant of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7 through co-infection of WTD. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult WTD are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally  we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in WTD  as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals  and from the genome of virus present in tissues of principal infected deer  fetuses and contact animals.

The mutations in the spike protein on the surface of the virion membrane not only allow for greater transmission but also raise concerns about vaccine effectiveness. Preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2  its variants  and other viruses from person to person via airborne or surface transmission requires effective inactivation of the virus. Here  we report a water-borne spray-on coating for the complete inactivation of viral particles and degradation of their RNA. Our nanoworms efficiently bind and  through subsequent large nanoscale conformational changes  rupture the viral membrane and subsequently bind and degrade its RNA. Our coating completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2  VIC01  and an evolved SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern  B.1.1.7  alpha    influenza A  and a surrogate capsid pseudovirus expressing the influenza A virus attachment glycoprotein  hemagglutinin. The polygalactose functionality on the nanoworms targets the conserved S2 subunit on the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface spike glycoprotein for stronger binding  and the additional attachment of guanidine groups catalyze the degradation of its RNA genome. Coating surgical masks with our nanoworms resulted in complete inactivation of VIC01 and B.1.1.7  providing a powerful control measure for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Inactivation was further observed for the influenza A and an AAV-HA capsid pseudovirus  providing broad viral inactivation when using the nanoworm system. The technology described here represents an environmentally friendly coating with a proposed nanomechanical mechanism for inactivation of both enveloped and capsid viruses. The functional nanoworms can be easily modified to target viruses in future pandemics  and is compatible with large scale manufacturing processes.

Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome  which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal  GI  and hepatic symptoms. However  the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation  infection in various organs  and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes  hypertension  obesity  cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders  and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population  which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review  we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants  mechanisms of infection and host immune response  GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19  and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern  VOC  have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha  B.1.1.7  UK   beta  B.1.351  South Africa   gamma  B.1.1.28.1  Brazil   and delta  B1.1.617  India  variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding  N501Y  P681R  and immune escape  L452R  E484K Q  T478K R  to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2  which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe  the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism  replication  and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury  acute hepatic decompensation  and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants  immunomodulation by viral proteins  and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.

Four variants of concern  VOCs  have been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   namely  B.1.617.2  delta   B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   and P.1  gamma   although the last three have been downgraded to variants being monitored  VBMs . VOCs and VBMs have shown increased transmissibility and or disease severity  resistance to convalescent SARS-CoV-2 immunity and antibody therapeutics  and the potential to evade diagnostic detection. Methods are needed for point-of-care  POC  testing to rapidly identify these variants  protect vulnerable populations  and improve surveillance. Antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests  Ag-RDTs  are ideal for POC use  but Ag-RDTs that recognize specific variants have not yet been implemented. Here  we describe a mAb  2E8  that is specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N501 residue. The 2E8 mAb can distinguish the delta VOC from variants with the N501Y meta-signature  which is characterized by convergent mutations that contribute to increased virulence and evasion of host immunity. Among the N501Y-containing mutants formerly designated as VOCs  alpha  beta  and gamma   a previously described mAb  CB6  can distinguish beta from alpha and gamma. When used in a sandwich ELISA  these mAbs sort these important SARS-CoV-2 variants into three diagnostic categories  namely   1  delta   2  alpha or gamma  and  3  beta. As delta is currently the predominant variant globally  they will be useful for POC testing to identify N501Y meta-signature variants  protect individuals in high-risk settings  and help detect epidemiological shifts among SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Analyses of convalescent sera provide unique insights into antibody longevity and cross-neutralizing activity induced by variant spike proteins  which are putative vaccine candidates. Using sera from 38 individuals infected in wave 1  we show that cross-neutralizing activity can be detected up to 305 days pos onset of symptoms  although sera were less potent against B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B1.351  Beta . Over time  despite a reduction in overall neutralization activity  differences in sera neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Beta variants decreased  which suggests that continued antibody maturation improves tolerance to spike mutations. We also compared the cross-neutralizing activity of wave 1 sera with sera from individuals infected with the Alpha  the Beta or the B.1.617.2  Delta  variants up to 79 days post onset of symptoms. While these sera neutralize the infecting VOC and parental virus to similar levels  cross-neutralization of different SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages is reduced. These findings will inform the optimization of vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

A triple mutant with an increase in thermal melting temperature of ~7°C with respect to the wild-type B.1 RBD and was expressed in high yield in both mammalian cells and the microbial host  Pichia pastoris  was downselected for immunogenicity studies. An additional derivative with three additional mutations from the B.1.351  beta  isolate was also introduced into this background. Lyophilized proteins were resistant to high-temperature exposure and could be stored for over a month at 37°C. In mice and hamsters  squalene-in-water emulsion  SWE  adjuvanted formulations of the B.1-stabilized RBD were considerably more immunogenic than RBD lacking the stabilizing mutations and elicited antibodies that neutralized all four current variants of concern with similar neutralization titers. However  sera from mice immunized with the stabilized B.1.351 derivative showed significantly decreased neutralization titers exclusively against the B.1.617.2  delta  VOC. A cocktail comprising stabilized B.1 and B.1.351 RBDs elicited antibodies with qualitatively improved neutralization titers and breadth relative to those immunized solely with either immunogen. Immunized hamsters were protected from high-dose viral challenge. Such vaccine formulations can be rapidly and cheaply produced  lack extraneous tags or additional components  and can be stored at room temperature. They are a useful modality to combat COVID-19  especially in remote and low-resource settings.

Importantly  several currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are associated with loss of efficacy for both vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: We analyzed the binding activity of six highly potent antibodies to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants  assessed their neutralizing abilities with pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluate efficacy of antibody cocktail in Delta SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster models as prophylactic and post-infection treatments. RESULTS: The tested RBD-chAbs  except RBD-chAb-25  maintained binding ability to spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants. However  only RBD-chAb-45 and -51 retained neutralizing activities; RBD-chAb-1  -15  -25 and -28 exhibited diminished neutralization for all SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably  several cocktails of our antibodies showed low IC 50  values  3.35–27.06 ng ml  against the SARS-CoV-2 variant pseudoviruses including United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7  Alpha   South Africa variant B.1.351  Beta   Brazil variant P1  Gamma   California variant B.1.429  Epsilon   New York variant B.1.526  Iota   and India variants  B.1.617.1  Kappa  and B.1.617.2  Delta . RBD-chAb-45  and -51 showed PRNT 50  values 4.93–37.54 ng ml when used as single treatments or in combination with RBD-chAb-15 or -28  according to plaque assays with authentic Alpha  Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore  the antibody cocktail of RBD-chAb-15 and -45 exhibited potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects in Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant-infected hamsters. CONCLUSIONS: The cocktail of RBD-chAbs exhibited potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These antibody cocktails are highly promising candidate tools for controlling new SARS-CoV-2 variants  including Delta.

We aimed to assess safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  AZD1222  vaccine in people with HIV and HIV-negative individuals in South Africa. METHODS: In this ongoing  double-blind  placebo-controlled  phase 1B 2A trial  COV005   people with HIV and HIV-negative participants aged 18–65 years were enrolled at seven South African locations and were randomly allocated  1:1  with full allocation concealment to receive a prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  with two doses given 28 days apart. Eligibility criteria for people with HIV included being on antiretroviral therapy for at least 3 months  with a plasma HIV viral load of less than 1000 copies per mL. In this interim analysis  safety and reactogenicity was assessed in all individuals who received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCov 19 between enrolment and Jan 15  2021. Primary immunogenicity analyses included participants who received two doses of trial intervention and were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04444674  and the Pan African Clinicals Trials Registry  PACTR202006922165132. FINDINGS: Between June 24 and Nov 12  2020  104 people with HIV and 70 HIV-negative individuals were enrolled. 102 people with HIV  52 vaccine; 50 placebo  and 56 HIV-negative participants  28 vaccine; 28 placebo  received the priming dose  100 people with HIV  51 vaccine; 49 placebo  and 46 HIV-negative participants  24 vaccine; 22 placebo  received two doses  priming and booster . In participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline  there were 164 adverse events in those with HIV  86 vaccine; 78 placebo  and 237 in HIV-negative participants  95 vaccine; 142 placebo . Of seven serious adverse events  one severe fever in a HIV-negative participant was definitely related to trial intervention and one severely elevated alanine aminotranferase in a participant with HIV was unlikely related; five others were deemed unrelated. One person with HIV died  unlikely related . People with HIV and HIV-negative participants showed vaccine-induced serum IgG responses against wild-type Wuhan-1 Asp614Gly  also known as D614G . For participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antigens at baseline  full-length spike geometric mean concentration  GMC  at day 28 was 163·7 binding antibody units  BAU  mL  95% CI 89·9–298·1  for people with HIV  n=36  and 112·3 BAU mL  61·7–204·4  for HIV-negative participants  n=23   with a rising day 42 GMC booster response in both groups. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive people with HIV demonstrated higher antibody responses after each vaccine dose than did people with HIV who were seronegative at baseline. High-level binding antibody cross-reactivity for the full-length spike and receptor-binding domain of the beta variant  B.1.351  was seen regardless of HIV status. In people with HIV who developed high titre responses  predominantly those who were receptor-binding domain seropositive at enrolment  neutralising activity against beta was retained. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was well tolerated  showing favourable safety and immunogenicity in people with HIV  including heightened immunogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 baseline-seropositive participants. People with HIV showed cross-reactive binding antibodies to the beta variant and Asp614Gly wild-type  and high responders retained neutralisation against beta.

METHODS: Sixty-six pediatric patients with B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of COVID-19 admitted to the hospital from July to August 2021 were classified into mild  n = 41  and moderate groups  n = 25 . Clinical characteristics  laboratory data and dynamic trends in different time periods were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in age  gender ratios and clinical symptoms between the mild group and the moderate group. All the patients in the moderate group had clusters of onsets  and the incubation period was shorter than that of the mild group. Within 24 hours of admission  the levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate  cardiac troponin I  D-dimer in the moderate group were higher than that in the mild group  P < 0.05 . The titers of immunoglobulin  Ig  G and IgM antibodies gradually increased after disease onset. Thirty-five  53.03%  children were tested positive for antibodies in 4–12 days. IgG increased gradually  while IgM decreased obviously in about 15 days after disease onset. The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid protein gene in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genomes increased gradually on the 3rd  6th  9th  and 12th days after disease onset  compared with those in day 0. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of children with B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of COVID-19 were mild. The description and analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory data can help medical staff to evaluate the condition of children with COVID-19 and to accumulate more clinical experience.

For this purpose  we designed an in vitro study following the evolution of MN and MDM infection at different time points in order to confirm whether these cells were permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally  we investigated whether  regardless of viral replication  the persistent virus can be transferred to non-infected cells permissive for viral replication. Thus  we co-cultured the infected MN MDM with permissive VERO E6 cells verifying the viral transmission. This is a further in vitro demonstration of the important role of MN and MDM in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and evolution of the COVID-19 disease.

Data are needed to characterize these infections and define correlates of breakthrough and infectivity. METHODS: At the largest medical center in Israel  we identified breakthrough infections by performing extensive evaluations of health care workers who were symptomatic  including mild symptoms  or had known infection exposure. These evaluations included epidemiologic investigations  repeat reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction  RT-PCR  assays  antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing  Ag-RDT   serologic assays  and genomic sequencing. Correlates of breakthrough infection were assessed in a case–control analysis. We matched patients with breakthrough infection who had antibody titers obtained within a week before SARS-CoV-2 detection  peri-infection period  with four to five uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict the geometric mean titers among cases and controls and the ratio between the titers in the two groups. We also assessed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and N gene cycle threshold  Ct  values with respect to infectivity. RESULTS: Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers for whom RT-PCR data were available  39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were documented. Neutralizing antibody titers in case patients during the peri-infection period were lower than those in matched uninfected controls  case-to-control ratio  0.361; 95% confidence interval  0.165 to 0.787 . Higher peri-infection neutralizing antibody titers were associated with lower infectivity  higher Ct values . Most breakthrough cases were mild or asymptomatic  although 19% had persistent symptoms  >6 weeks . The B.1.1.7  alpha  variant was found in 85% of samples tested. A total of 74% of case patients had a high viral load  Ct value  <30  at some point during their infection; however  of these patients  only 17  59%  had a positive result on concurrent Ag-RDT. No secondary infections were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Among fully vaccinated health care workers  the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period. Most breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic  although persistent symptoms did occur.

This study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity in Rio Grande do Sul  RS   Brazil  including the first reported case in each Regional Health Coordination and cases from three epidemic peaks. Ninety SARS-CoV-2 genomes from RS were sequenced and analyzed through comparison with SARS-CoV-2 datasets available in GISAID for phylogenetic inference and mutation analysis. Among the first reported cases  we found the following lineages: B.1  33.3%   B.1.1.28  26.7%   B.1.1  13.3%   B.1.1.33  10.0%   and A  6.7%   evidencing SARS-CoV-2 introduction by both international origin and community-driven transmission. We found predominance of B.1.1.33  50.0%  and B.1.1.28  35.0%  during the first epidemic peak  July–August 2020   emergence of P.2  55.6%  in the second peak  November–December 2020   and massive spread of P.1 and related sequences  78.4%   such as P.1-like-II  P.1.1 and P.1.2 in the third peak  February–April  2021 . Eighteen novel mutation combinations were found among P.1 genomes  and 22 different spike mutations and or deletions among P.1 and related sequences. This study shows the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Southern Brazil and describes SARS-CoV-2 diversity during three epidemic peaks  highlighting the spread of P.1 and the high genetic diversity of currently circulating lineages. Genomic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide health authorities' decisions to control COVID-19 in Brazil.

However  variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved  with early studies showing that some mAbs may not sustain their efficacy in the face of escape mutants. Also  from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  concern has been raised about the potential for Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement  ADE  of infection. In this study  plaque reduction neutralization assays demonstrated that mAb 1741-LALA neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.351  D614 and D614G. MAbs S1D2-hIgG1 and S1D2-LALA mutant  STI-1499-LALA  did not neutralize B.1.351  but did neutralize SARS-CoV-2 strains D614 and D614G. LALA mutations did not result in substantial differences in neutralizing abilities between clones S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA. S1D2-hIgG1  STI-1499-LALA  and convalescent plasma showed minimal ability to induce ADE in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Further  no differences in pharmacokinetic clearance of S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA were observed in mice expressing human FcRn. These findings confirm that SARS-CoV-2 has already escaped some mAbs  and identify a mAb candidate that may neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. They also suggest that risk of ADE in macrophages may be low with SARS-CoV-2 D614  and LALA Fc change impacts neither viral neutralization nor Ab clearance.

Immune serum from vaccinated subjects seems to  largely  retain titres of neutralizing antibodies  even against SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012 01-lineage B.1.1.7. Here  we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 infection in three HCWs in a hospital setting; two of the HCWs were fully vaccinated  i.e.  had received two doses . METHODS: Two physicians and one nurse working on the same shift on February 20  2021  were involved in the outbreak. Real-time PCR  antigen tests  and serological tests for the IgG anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were performed  along with whole-genome sequencing  WGS . RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all three HCWs; all presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19. The two physicians were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine  with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012 01-lineage B.1.1.7  suggesting a common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment  PPE . CONCLUSIONS: This mini-outbreak highlights some important issues about the efficacy of vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants  the high risk of exposure among HCWs  and the need for optimized implementation of PPE in hospitals. The wide circulation of VOC 202012 01 in Europe and Italy highlights the need to improve surveillance and genetic sequencing.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped  positive-sense  single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanism that corrects copying mistakes and thus SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is extremely low. Despite lower mutation rate of the virus  researchers have detected a total of 12 706 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome  the majority of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms. Sequencing data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 accumulates two-single nucleotide mutations per month in its genome. Recently  an amino acid aspartate  D  to glycine  G   D614G  mutation due to an adenine to guanine nucleotide change at position 23 403 at the 614th amino-acid position of the spike protein in the original reference genotype has been identified. The SARS-CoV-2 viruses that carry the spike protein D614G mutation have become dominant variant around the world. The D614G mutation has been found to be associated with 3 other mutations in the spike protein. Clinical and pseudovirus experimental studies have demonstrated that the spike protein D614G mutation alters the virus phenotype. However  the impact of the mutation on the rate of transmission between people  disease severity and the vaccine and therapeutic development remains unclear. Three variants of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been identified. They are B.1.1.7  UK  variant  B.1.351  N501Y.V2  South African  variant and B.1.1.28  Brazilian  variant. Epidemiological data suggest that they have a higher transmissibility than the original variant. There are reports that some vaccines are less efficacious against the B.1.351 variant. This review article discusses the effects of novel mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on transmission  clinical outcomes and vaccine development.

However  genetic differences have emerged among SARS-CoV-2 lineages  and it is possible that these differences may affect environmental stability and the potential for aerosol transmission. METHODS: The influence of temperature  relative humidity  and simulated sunlight on the decay of four SARS-CoV-2 isolates in aerosols  including one belonging to the recently emerged B.1.1.7 lineage  were compared in a rotating drum chamber. Aerosols were generated from simulated respiratory tract lining fluid to represent aerosols originating from the deep lung. RESULTS: No differences in the stability of the isolates were observed in the absence of simulated sunlight at either 20°C or 40°C. However  a small but statistically significant difference in the stability was observed between some isolates in simulated sunlight at 20°C and 20% relative humidity. . CONCLUSIONS: The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols does not vary greatly among currently circulating lineages  including B.1.1.7  suggesting that the increased transmissibility associated with recent SARS-CoV-2 lineages is not due to enhanced survival in the environment.

We sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that occurred in a highly dense population area in Colombo  Sri Lanka from April to May 2020. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2  assessed the SARS-CoV-2 specific total and neutralizing antibodies  Nabs  in a densely packed  underserved settlement  n = 2722  after identification of the index case on 15 th  April 2020. 89 2722 individuals were detected as infected by RT-qPCR with a secondary attack rate among close contacts being 0.077  95% CI 0.063–0.095 . Another 30 asymptomatic individuals were found to have had COVID-19 based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However  only 61.5% of those who were initially seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 had detectable total antibodies at 120 to 160 days  while only 40.6% had detectable Nabs. 74 89  83.1%  of RT-qPCR positive individuals were completely asymptomatic and all 15  16.9%  who experienced symptoms were classified as having a mild illness. 18  20.2%  were between the ages of 61 to 80. 11 89  12.4%  had diabetes  8 89  9%  had cardiovascular disease and 4  4.5%  had asthma. Of the two viruses that were sequenced and were of the B.1 and B.4 lineages with one carrying the D614G mutation. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: Almost all infected individuals developed mild or asymptomatic illness despite the presence of comorbid illnesses. Since the majority of those who were in this underserved settlement were not infected despite circulation of the D614G variant  it would be important to further study environmental and host factors that lead to disease severity and transmission.

METHODS: A retrospective  comparative analysis of initial chest CT manifestations between 63 pediatric patients infected with Delta variant in 2021 and 23 pediatric patients with COVID-19 in 2020 was conducted. Corresponding imaging features were analyzed. In addition  the changing trend in imaging features of COVID-19 Delta-variant cases were explored by evaluating the initial and follow-up CT scans. RESULTS: Among 63 children with Delta-variant COVID-19 in 2021  34  53.9%  showed positive chest CT presentation; and their CT score  1.10 ± 1.41  was significantly lower than that in 2020  2.56 ± 3.5   P = 0.0073 . Lesion distribution: lung lesions of Delta cases appear mainly in the lower lungs on both sides. Most children had single lobe involvement  18 cases  52.9%   14  41.2%  in the right lung alone  and 14  41.2%  in both lungs. A majority of Delta cases displayed initially ground glass  23 cases  67.6%  and nodular shadows  13 cases  38.2%  in the first CT scan  with few extrapulmonary manifestations. The 34 children with abnormal chest CT for the first time have a total of 92 chest CT examinations. These children showed a statistically significant difference between the 0–3 day group and the 4–7 day group  P = 0.0392  and a significant difference between the 4–7 day group and the more than 8 days group  P = 0.0003 . CONCLUSIONS: The early manifestations of COVID-19 in children with abnormal imaging are mostly small subpleural nodular ground glass opacity. The changes on the Delta-variant COVID-19 chest CT were milder than the original strain. The lesions reached a peak on CT in 4–7 days and quickly improved and absorbed after a week. Dynamic CT re-examination can achieve a good prognosis.

Therefore  we began testing all patients with COVID‐19 for the N501Y and E484K mutations by using polymerase chain reaction  PCR ‐based methods. Nasopharyngeal swab samples from 108 patients who visited our hospital between February and April 2021 were analyzed. The samples were analyzed using reverse transcription‐PCR with melting curve analysis to detect the N501Y and E484K mutations. A part of the samples was also subjected to whole‐genome sequencing  WGS . Clinical parameters such as mortality and admission to the intensive care unit were analyzed to examine the association between increased disease severity and the E484K mutation. The ratio of cases showing the 501N + 484K mutation rapidly increased from 8% in February to 46% in March. WGS revealed that the viruses with 501N + 484K mutation are R.1 lineage variants. Evidence of increased disease severity related to the R.1 variants was not found. We found that the R.1 lineage variants rapidly prevailed in Tokyo in March 2021  which suggests the increased transmissibility of R.1 variants  while they showed no increased severity.

Here  we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccine candidate adjuvanted by PIKA  which can induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses. The results showed a high level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine was maintained for at least 400 days. In the study of non-human primates  PIKA adjuvanted S-trimer induced high SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers and protected from virus replication in the lung following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In addition  the long-term neutralizing antibody response induced by S-trimer vaccine adjuvanted by PIKA could neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and there is no obvious different among the SARS- CoV-2 variants of interest or concern  including B.1.351  B.1.1.7  P.1  B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants. These data support the utility of S-trimer protein adjuvanted by PIKA as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the early stages of the pandemic  countries with universal BCG vaccination programs registered a low number of new cases of COVID-19  with the situation now reversed  as exemplified by India. The high genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2  a known characteristic of RNA viruses  causing the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have led to the virus adapting to overcome the initial immune protection. The strains from the United Kingdom  B1.1.7   Brazil  B1.1.28 and B1.1.33   South Africa  B.1.351   and India  B.1.617  are characterized by a greater ability to spread in the environment  in comparison with the original infectious agent of SARS-CoV-2. It should be remembered that the large variation in the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 may result in future changes in its pathogenicity  immunogenicity and antigenicity  and therefore it is necessary to carefully study the mutations occurring within the virus to determine whether the current vaccines will remain effective. However  most studies show that monoclonal antibodies produced after vaccination against COVID-19 are effective against the newly developed variants.

Here  we present a comprehensive assessment of the impact of variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.429  and B.1.526 on binding  neutralizing  and ACE2-blocking antibodies elicited by the vaccine mRNA-1273 over seven months. Cross-reactive neutralizing responses were rare after a single dose of mRNA-1273. At the peak of response to the second dose  all subjects had robust responses to all variants. Binding and functional antibodies against variants persisted in most subjects  albeit at low levels  for 6 months after the primary series of mRNA-1273. Across all assays  B.1.351 had the greatest impact on antibody recognition  and B.1.1.7 the least. These data complement ongoing studies of clinical protection to inform the potential need for additional boost vaccinations.

Since the recent emergence of new variants  associated with increased transmissibility and or antibody escape  variants of concern   there is an urgent need for methods that enable specific and timely detection and quantification of the occurrence of these variants in the community. In this study  we demonstrate the use of RT-ddPCR on wastewater samples for specific detection of mutation N501Y. This assay enabled simultaneous enumeration of lineage B.1.351  containing the 501Y mutation  and Wild Type  WT  containing 501N  SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detection of N501Y was possible in samples with mixtures of WT with low proportions of B.1.351  0.5%  and could accurately determine the proportion of N501Y and WT in mixtures of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The application to raw sewage samples from the cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht demonstrated that this method can be applied to wastewater samples. The emergence of N501Y in Amsterdam and Utrecht wastewater aligned with the emergence of B.1.1.7 as causative agent of COVID-19 in the Netherlands  indicating that RT-ddPCR of wastewater samples can be used to monitor the emergence of the N501Y mutation in the community. It also indicates that RT-ddPCR could be used for sensitive and accurate monitoring of current  like K417N  K417T  E484K  L452R  or future mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Monitoring these mutations can be used to obtain insight in the introduction and spread of VOC and support public health decision-making regarding measures to limit viral spread or allocation of testing or vaccination.

The emergence of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants has raised concerns of reduced vaccine efficacy and increased re-infection rates. Here we show  that after the second dose  the sera of BNT162b2-vaccinated health care workers  n = 180  effectively neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 variant with the D614G substitution and the B.1.1.7 variant  whereas the neutralization of the B.1.351 variant is five-fold reduced. Despite the reduction  92% of the seronegative vaccinees have a neutralization titre of >20 for the B.1.351 variant indicating some protection. The vaccinees’ neutralization titres exceeded those of recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our work provides evidence that the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine induces cross-neutralization of at least some of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

As of Mid-June 2021  over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomesequences have been deposited in the GISAID database from Bangladesh which were extracted and categorized into two waves. By analyzing these genome sequences  it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of mutation sample  30.79%  than the wave-1 samples  12.32% . Wave-2 samples also had a higher frequency of deletion  and transversion events. During the first wave  the GR clade was the most predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave. The B.1.1.25 variant showed the highest frequency in wave-1 while in case of wave-2  the B.1.351.3 variant  was the most common one. A notable presence of the delta variant  which is currently at the center of concern  was also observed. Comparison of the Spike protein found in the reference and the 3 most common lineages found in Bangladesh namely  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617 in terms of their ability to form stable complexes with ACE2 receptor revealed that B.1.617 had the potential to be more transmissible than others. Importantly  no indigenous variants have been detected so far which implies that the successful prevention of import of foreign variants can diminish the outbreak in the country.

The antibodies were obtained from a phage display library built with the VH repertoire of a convalescent COVID-19 patient who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta . The patient received a single dose of Ad5-nCoV vaccine  Convidecia™  CanSino Biologics Inc.  one month before developing COVID-19 symptoms. Four synthetic VL libraries were used as counterparts of the immune VH repertoire. After three rounds of panning with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain wildtype  RBD-WT  34 unique scFvs  were identified  with 27 cross-reactive for the RBD-WT and RBD Delta  RBD-DT   and seven specifics for the RBD-WT. The cross-reactive scFvs were more diverse than the RBD-WT specific ones  being encoded by several IGHV genes from the IGHV1 and IGHV3 families combined with short HCDR3s. Six cross-reactive scFvs and one RBD-WT specific scFv were converted to human IgG1  hIgG1 . Out of the seven antibodies  six blocked the RBD-WT binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2   suggesting these antibodies may neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly  one of the antibodies also recognized the RBD from the B.1.1.529  Omicron  isolate  implying that the VH repertoire of the convalescent patient would protect against SARS-CoV-2 Wildtype  Delta  and Omicron. From a practical viewpoint  the triple cross-reactive antibody provides the substrate for developing therapeutic antibodies with a broad SARS-CoV-2 neutralization profile.

SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 3.5 million deaths since late 2019. Mutations in the spike  S  glycoprotein are of particular concern because it harbours the domain which recognises the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor and is the target for neutralising antibodies. Mutations in the S protein may induce alterations in the surface spike structures  changing the conformational B-cell epitopes and leading to a potential reduction in vaccine efficacy. Here  we summarise how the more important variants of SARS-CoV-2  which include cluster 5  lineages B.1.1.7  Alpha variant   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  B.1.1.28 Gamma   B.1.427 B.1.429  Epsilon   B.1.526  Iota  and B.1.617.2  Delta  confer mutations in their respective spike proteins which enhance viral fitness by improving binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and lead to an increase in infectivity and transmission. We further discuss how these spike protein mutations provide resistance against immune responses  either acquired naturally or induced by vaccination. This information will be valuable in guiding the development of vaccines and other therapeutics for protection against the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic.

Applying this system to study three variants of concern  we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6%  95% CI: 32.3–54.6%  transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4%  95% CI: 14.6–48.0%  transmissibility increase and 61.3%  95% CI: 42.6–85.8%  immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3%  95% CI: 30.3–65.3%  transmissibility increase and 52.5%  95% CI: 0–75.8%  immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of variants of concern  via continued preventive measures  prompt mass-vaccination  continued vaccine efficacy monitoring  and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy.

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply and a SARS-CoV-2 variant  B.1.617  is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain  which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore  we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two out of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast  B.1.617 is resistant against Bamlanivimab  an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. B.1.617 evades antibodies induced by infection or vaccination  although less so than the B.1.351 variant. Collectively  our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

In this study  the efficacy of control strategies in South Korea was evaluated using genomic epidemiology based on viral genome sequences of 2 065 SARS-CoV-2 cases identified in South Korea from January 2020 to December 2020. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of viruses introduced from inbound travelers did not further spread throughout South Korea; however  four distinct subgroups  KR.1–4  belonging to B.1.497  B.1  K.1 and B.41  of viruses caused local epidemics. After the introduction of enhanced social distancing  the viral population size and daily case numbers decreased  and KR.2–4 subgroups were extinguished from South Korea. Nevertheless  there was a subsequent increase in KR.1 subgroups after the downgrading of social distancing level. These results indicate that the international traveler quarantine system implemented in South Korea along with social distancing measures efficiently reduced the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2  but it was not completely controlled. An improvement of control strategies will be required to better control SARS-CoV-2  its variants  and future pandemic viruses.

Here  we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs  mAbs  derived from memory B cells  which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain  NTD  and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite  designated site i  recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion  activate effector functions  and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge  albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed  several SARS-CoV-2 variants  including the B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P1 lineages  harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design.

We assessed the recognition of three VOCs  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1  in cohorts of COVID-19 convalescent patients  n = 69  and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients  n = 50 . Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOCs were substantially reduced in most individuals  with the largest four- to sevenfold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351. While hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all three VOCs  39% of nonhospitalized patients exhibited no detectable neutralization against B.1.351. Moreover  monoclonal neutralizing antibodies show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and P.1 but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOCs and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative  case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences  a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi  India   who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15  2021. Cases  test-positives  and controls  test-negatives  were matched  1:1  on the basis of age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure  to COVID-19   previous SARS-CoV-2 infection  and calendar time  using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152  with the second dose received at least 14 days before testing  in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  expressed as  1 – odds ratio  × 100%. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15  2021  3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these  2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination status  and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50%  95% CI 33–62; p<0·0001 . The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46%  95% CI 22–62  and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57%  21–76 . After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections  the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47%  95% CI 29–61 . INTERPRETATION: This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases  presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta  B.1.617.2  variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this vaccine to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2  while continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological measures. FUNDING: None.

The study included 8 deceased patients with COVID-19. Tissue samples from the middle ear were subjected to virology  histopathology  scanning  SEM  and transmission  TEM  electron microscopy investigation. Ethmoidal mucosa samples were processed for virology analyses. qPCR resulted positive for 75% of nasal mucosa samples and 50% of middle ear samples. Ct values showed lower viral loads in middle ear samples. A proportion of 66.6% patients with positive results in the nasal mucosa showed positive results in the middle ear  and the subtype analysis of the complete genome sequences indicated B.1.1.7 lineage for all samples. In histopathological and SEM samples  no pathological aspects were identified. TEM revealed on the background of death critical alteration of cellular morphology  suggestive structures resembling SARS-CoV-2  goblet cells and immune cells. SARS-CoV-2 can be present in the middle ear of COVID-19 patients even if there is not clinical evidence of acute otitis media. Otolaryngologists could be particularly exposed to COVID-19 infection.

Therefore  rapid identification of viral variants circulating in the population is crucial for epidemiological assessment and efforts to contain the resurgence of the pandemic. Between January and November 2021  we performed a large variant RT-qPCR-based screening of mutations in the spike protein of 1851 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples derived from outpatients from the UC-Christus Health Network in Chile. In a portion of samples  n = 636   we validated our RT-qPCR-pipeline by WGS  obtaining a 99.2% concordance. Our results indicate that from January to March 2021 there was a dominance of non-identifiable variants by the RT-qPCR-based screening; however  throughout WGS we were able to identify the Lambda  C.37  variant of interest  VOI . From March to July  we observed the rapid emergence of mutations associated with the Gamma variant  P.1   which was quickly replaced by the appearance of a combination of samples harboring mutations associated with the Delta variant  B.1.617.2   which predominated until the end of the study. Our results highlight the applicability of cost-effective RT-qPCR-based screening of mutations associated with known variants of concern  VOC   VOI and variants under monitoring  VUM  of SARS-CoV-2  being a rapid and reliable tool that complements WGS-based surveillance.

Here  we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA-seq and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies  nAbs  localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding domain  RBD  epitopes. One of these mAbs  BG10-19  locks the spike trimer in a closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2  the recently arising mutants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together  our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and therapeutic design against coronaviruses.

METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A  20B  and 20C  first phase  February–May 2020   Pangolin lineages B.1.177  we named Marseille-2  and B.1.160  Marseille-4  variants  second phase  June–December 2020   and B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma  and A.27  Marseille-501  variants  third phase  January 2021-today . Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures  including hospitalisation  transfer to the intensive-care unit  and death. RESULTS: During each phase  no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution  the prevalence of chronic diseases  and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others. CONCLUSION: A large cohort study is recommended to evaluate the transmissibility and to better characterise the clinical severity of emerging variants.

We report a single-nucleotide variant  SNV  in the nucleocapsid  N  gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   i.e.  G29179T  which impairs the diagnostic sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay  Cepheid  Sunnyvale  CA  USA . We observed significant differences between the threshold cycle  Ct  values for envelope  E  and N genes and confirmed the SNV as the cause of the differences using Sanger sequencing. This SNV  G29179T  is the most prevalent in Korea and is associated with the B.1.497 virus lineage  which is dominant in Korea. Clinical laboratories should be aware of the various SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and consider their potential effects on the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.

However  the robustness and functionality of the humoral and T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown 12 months after initial infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of the humoral and T-cell response to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants in recovered patients 12 months after infection. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study  we recruited participants who had recovered from COVID-19 and who were discharged from the Wuhan Research Center for Communicable Disease Diagnosis and Treatment at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences  Wuhan  China  between Jan 7 and May 29  2020. Patients received a follow-up visit between Dec 16  2020  and Jan 27  2021. We evaluated the presence of IgM  IgA  and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein  Spike protein  and the receptor-binding domain 12 months after initial infection  using ELISA. Neutralising antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain  and the D614G  beta  B.1.351   and delta  B.1.617.2  variants were analysed using a microneutralisation assay in a subset of plasma samples. We analysed the magnitude and breadth of the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-cell responses using the interferon γ  IFNγ  enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot  ELISpot  assay and intracellular cytokine staining  ICS  assay. The antibody response and T-cell response  ie  IFN-γ  interleukin-2 [IL-2]  and tumour necrosis factor α [TNFα]  were analysed by age and disease severity. Antibody titres were also analysed according to sequelae symptoms. FINDINGS: We enrolled 1096 patients  including 289  26·4%  patients with moderate initial disease  734  67·0%  with severe initial disease  and 73  6·7%  with critical initial disease. Paired plasma samples were collected from 141 patients during the follow-up visits for the microneutralisation assay. PBMCs were collected from 92 of 141 individuals at the 12-month follow-up visit  of which 80 were analysed by ELISpot and 92 by ICS assay to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-cell responses. N-IgG  899 [82·0%]   S-IgG  1043 [95·2%]   RBD-IgG  1032 [94·2%]   and neutralising  115 [81·6%] of 141  antibodies were detectable 12 months after initial infection in most individuals. Neutralising antibodies remained stable 6 and 12 months after initial infection in most individuals younger than 60 years. Multifunctional T-cell responses were detected for all SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins tested. There was no difference in the magnitude of T-cell responses or cytokine profiles in individuals with different symptom severity. Moreover  we evaluated both antibody and T-cell responses to the D614G  beta  and delta viral strains. The degree of reduced in-vitro neutralising antibody responses to the D614G and delta variants  but not to the beta variant  was associated with the neutralising antibody titres after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also found poor neutralising antibody responses to the beta variant; 83  72·2%  of 115 patients showed no response at all. Moreover  the neutralising antibody titre reduction of the recovered patient plasma against the delta variant was similar to that of the D614G variant and lower than that of the beta variant. By contrast  T-cell responses were cross-reactive to the beta variant in most individuals. Importantly  T-cell responses could be detected in all individuals who had lost the neutralising antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 12 months after the initial infection. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses were retained 12 months after initial infection. Neutralising antibodies to the D614G  beta  and delta viral strains were reduced compared with those for the original strain  and were diminished in general. Memory T-cell responses to the original strain were not disrupted by new variants. This study suggests that cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses could be particularly important in the protection against severe disease caused by variants of concern whereas neutralising antibody responses seem to reduce over time.

A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions  which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation  while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Here  we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis  and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA  or AUP  to its overall hydrolysis rate. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design  we compare AUP optimization by conventional mRNA design methods to results from more computationally sophisticated algorithms and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. We find that rational design on Eterna and the more sophisticated algorithms lead to constructs with low AUP  which we term ‘superfolder’ mRNAs. These designs exhibit a wide diversity of sequence and structure features that may be desirable for translation  biophysical size  and immunogenicity. Furthermore  their folding is robust to temperature  computer modeling method  choice of flanking untranslated regions  and changes in target protein sequence  as illustrated by rapid redesign of superfolder mRNAs for B.1.351  P.1 and B.1.1.7 variants of the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increases in in vitro mRNA half-life by at least two-fold appear immediately achievable.

Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave. Here  we build a phylogeographic model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages  as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages  contributed to the COVID-19 resurgence in Europe. We inform this model using genomic  mobility and epidemiological data from 10 West European countries and estimate that in many countries more than 50% of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since June 15th. The success in onwards transmission of these lineages is predicted by SARS-CoV-2 incidence during this period. Relatively early introductions from Spain into the United Kingdom contributed to the successful spread of the 20A.EU1 B.1.177 variant. The pervasive spread of variants that have not been associated with an advantage in transmissibility highlights the threat of novel variants of concern that emerged more recently and have been disseminated by holiday travel. Our findings indicate that more effective and coordinated measures are required to contain spread through cross-border travel.

With evolution of the virus updated methods for the evaluation of the immune response in infected and vaccinated individuals are required to determine the durability of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. METHODS: We developed a multiplexed surrogate virus neutralization test  plex-sVNT  that simultaneously measures the ability of antibodies in serum to inhibit binding between angiotensin converting enzyme-2  ACE2  and 7 SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein variants  including wild type  B.1.1.7 α   B.1.351 β   P.1 γ   B.1.617.2 δ   B.1.617.1 κ   and B.1.429 ε . The assay was validated against a plaque reduction neutralization test  PRNT . We evaluated 170 samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 281 samples from 188 individuals that received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines. RESULTS: The plex-sVNT demonstrated >96% concordance with PRNT. Antibody neutralization activity was significantly reduced for all SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to wild type in both the infected and vaccinated cohorts. There was a decline in overall antibody neutralization activity  within both cohorts  out to 5 months post infection or vaccination  with the rate of decline being more significant for the vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The plex-sVNT provides a correlative measure to PRNT and a convenient approach for evaluating antibody neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants is reduced compared to wild type and declines over the ensuing months after exposure or vaccination within each cohort  however it is still unknown what degree of neutralizing capacity is protective.

METHODS: We examined the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7  Alpha  that arose in the United Kingdom and spread globally. We determined titres of spike glycoprotein-binding antibodies and authentic virus neutralising antibodies induced by B.1.1.7 infection to infer homotypic and heterotypic immunity. RESULTS: Antibodies elicited by B.1.1.7 infection exhibited significantly reduced recognition and neutralisation of parental strains or of the South Africa variant B.1.351  Beta  than of the infecting variant. The drop in cross-reactivity was significantly more pronounced following B.1.1.7 than parental strain infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that heterotypic immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 variants is asymmetric.

A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS CoV-2  using a nasopharyngeal swab sample. After he returned home and a telephone follow-up  he was found deceased 9 days after first showing symptoms. Whole-body  non-enhanced  post-mortem computed tomography  PMCT  and a forensic autopsy were performed approximately 48 h after death  with sanitary precautions. The PMCT showed bilateral and diffuse crazy-paving lung opacities  with bilateral pleural effusions. Post-mortem virology studies detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2  B.1 lineage  in the nasopharynx  plasma  lung biopsies  pleural effusion and faeces confirming the persistence of viral ribonucleic acid 48 h after death. Microscopic examination showed that severe lung damage was responsible for his death. The main abnormality was diffuse alveolar damage  associated with different stages of inflammation and fibrosis. This case is one of the first to describe complete post-mortem data for a COVID-19 death and highlights the ability of PMCT to detect severe involvement of the lungs before autopsy in an apparently natural death. The present pathology results are concordant with previously reported findings and reinforce the disease pathogenesis hypothesis of combined viral replication with an inappropriate immune response.

The genome of the Omicron VOC contains more than 50 mutations  many of which have been associated with increased transmissibility  differing disease severity  and potential to evade immune responses developed for previous VOCs such as Alpha and Delta. In the days since the designation of B.1.1.529 as a VOC  infections with the lineage have been reported in countries around the globe and many countries have implemented travel restrictions and increased border controls in response. We putatively detected the Omicron variant in an aircraft wastewater sample from a flight arriving to Darwin  Australia from Johannesburg  South Africa on the 25th of November 2021 via positive results on the CDC N1  CDC N2  and del 69–70  RT-qPCR assays per guidance from the WHO. The Australian Northern Territory Health Department detected one passenger onboard the flight who was infected with SARS-CoV-2  which was determined to be the Omicron VOC by sequencing of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Subsequent sequencing of the aircraft wastewater sample using the ARTIC V3 protocol with Nanopore and ATOPlex confirmed the presence of the Omicron variant with a consensus genome that clustered with the B.1.1.529 BA.1 sub-lineage. Our detection and confirmation of a single onboard Omicron infection via aircraft wastewater further bolsters the important role that aircraft wastewater can play as an independent and unintrusive surveillance point for infectious diseases  particularly coronavirus disease 2019.

Although vaccines based on the original Wuhan sequence have been shown to be effective at preventing COVID-19  their efficacy is likely to be decreased against more neutralization-resistant variants-of-concern  VOC   in particular  the Beta variant originating in South Africa. We assessed  in mice  rabbits  and non-human primates  whether a third vaccination with experimental Wuhan-based Spike vaccines could alleviate this problem. Our data show that a third immunization improves neutralizing antibody titers against the variants-of-concern  Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   and Delta  B.1.617.2 . After three vaccinations  the level of neutralization against Beta was similar to the level of neutralization against the original strain after two vaccinations  suggesting that simply providing a third immunization could nullify the reduced activity of current vaccines against VOC.

Its mutation rate is high  involving the spike  S  gene and thus there has been a rapid spread of new variants. Herein  we describe a rapid  easy  adaptable  and affordable workflow to uniquely identify all currently known variants through as few analyses. Our method only requires two conventional PCRs of the S gene and two Sanger sequencing reactions  and possibly another PCR sequencing assay on a N gene portion to identify the B.1.160 lineage. Methods: We selected an S gene 1312 bp portion containing a set of SNPs useful for discriminating all variants. Mathematical  statistical  and bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that our choice allowed us to identify all variants even without looking for all related mutations  as some of them are shared by different variants  e.g.  N501Y is found in the Alpha  Beta  and Gamma variants  whereas others  that are more informative  are unique  e.g.  A57 distinctive to the Alpha variant . Results: A “weight” could be assigned to each mutation that may be present in the selected portion of the S gene. The method’s robustness was confirmed by analyzing 80 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. Conclusions: Our workflow identified the variants without the need for whole-genome sequencing and with greater reliability than with commercial kits.

In the present investigation m-RNA and vector based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analysed with respect to postvaccination infections in vaccinated hospital employees. METHODS: 8 553 staff members were vaccinated with BNT162b2  47%  or ChAdOx1-S  53%  between January and May 2021. In a retrospective observational cohort study  incidence of SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections was analysed in relation to demographic data  viral load  virus variants  vaccine brand and vaccination status at time of positive PCR test  “fully vaccinated”  ≥14 days since second dose   “partially vaccinated”  >21 days since first  but < 14 days after second dose   “insufficiently vaccinated”  <22 days since first dose  . RESULTS: Within the follow-up period  ending on July 31 st   2021  person-time at risk adjusted monthly rates for SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections were 0·18%  BNT162b2  and 0·57%  ChAdOx1-S  for insufficiently  0·34%  BNT162b2  and 0·32%  ChAdOx1-S  for partially and 0·06%  BNT162b2  and 0·04%  ChAdOx1-S  for fully vaccinated participants. The two vaccine types did not differ with respect to hazard ratios for none of the respective postvaccination infection types. No cases of COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths were reported. Genotyping of positive PCR specimens revealed 42 variant of concerns: B.1.1.7  Alpha variant; n=34 ; B.1.351  Beta variant; n=2   B.1.617.2  Delta variant; n=6 . CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-S are both effective in preventing breakthrough infections  however  it seems important  that all recommended vaccine doses are administered.

We further compared transmission between the Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant and non-Variant of Concern  non-VOC  viruses. From May 2020 throughout April 2021  we recruited 70 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 146 household contacts. Participants donated biological samples eight times over 6 weeks and answered questionnaires. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected by real-time RT-PCR. Whole genome sequencing and droplet digital PCR were used to establish virus variant and viral load. SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in 60% of the households  and the overall SAR for household contacts was 50%. The SAR was significantly higher for the Alpha variant  78%  compared with non-VOC viruses  43%  and was associated with a higher viral load. SAR was higher in household contacts aged ≥40 years  69%  than in younger contacts  40–47%   and for contacts of primary cases with loss of taste smell. Children had lower viral loads and were more often asymptomatic than adults. Sleeping separately from the primary case reduced the risk of transmission. In conclusion  we found substantial household transmission  particularly for the Alpha variant. Precautionary practices seem to reduce SAR  but preventing household transmission may become difficult with more contagious variants  depending on vaccine use and effectiveness.

We have used a modified susceptible  infected  recovered  SIR  epidemiological model to predict how the spread of the virus in regions of France will vary depending on the proportions of variants and on the public health strategies adopted  including anti-COVID-19 vaccination. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7  which was not detected in early January  increased to become 60% of the forms of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the Toulouse urban area at the beginning of February 2021  but there was no increase in positive nucleic acid tests. Our prediction model indicates that maintaining public health measures and accelerating vaccination are efficient strategies for the sustained control of SARS-CoV-2.

On December 24  he returned from Muscat to Guangzhou by airplane and was transferred to a centralized isolation hotel in Foshan. He was sampled on the third day of the quarantine  and the result returned to be COVID-19 positive on December 27  2021. He was transported to the Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital for isolated treatment by negative pressure ambulance on the same day. The case had two lungs focal inflamed according to the chest CT examination. On December 28  2021  the nasal swab of the imported case was sequenced using Illumina MiniSeq by Guangdong CDC. The viral RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using ULSEN®2019-nCoV Whole Genome Capture Kit  Beijing MicroFuture Technology Co.  Ltd  Beijing  China  V-090418   then the sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit  Illumina  Inc.  San Diego  USA  FC-131-1001  and conducted Illumina sequencing. On December 29  2021  the sequencing analysis concluded that the virus genome belonged to lineage BA.2  VOC Omicron  EPI_ISL_8207301 . Compared with the Wuhan reference sequence  EPI_ISL_402119   1   the strain from the case displayed 67 nucleotide variation sites. The sequence reported on the evolutionary branch is most similar to those reported in Singapore on December 20  2021 and Australia on December 1  2021  Figure 1 . In protein level  a total of 49 amino acid mutation sites and 9 amino acid deletions were observed  including 27 mutations and 3 deletions in the spike protein. On November 26  2021  Omicron was listed by the World Health Organization  WHO  as the fifth “Variant of Concern  VOC ”  2 . Studies showed that the VOC Omicron strains have evolved into 3 lineages  namely as BA.1  BA.2 and BA.3  the most popular lineage is the lineage of BA.1. The BA.2 lineage has been nicknamed as ‘Stealth Omicron’ because it differs from the ‘standard’ variety by not having the characteristic SGTF-causing deletion  H69del and V70del   3-6 . A total of 89 sequences of BA.2 have been uploaded in GISAID  mostly comprised of sequences from South Africa  Denmark  Canada  the United Kingdom  the United States  India  and other countries. The earliest BA.2 sequence was uploaded from South Africa on November 27  2021  7 . The case in this study was the first BA.2 lineage discovered in China. The biological characteristics and transmissibility may be different because of the difference of the genomes of the BA.2 lineage  so further study and long-term surveillance are urgently needed.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is associated with inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets and could causes severe complications. Until today several “waves” of infections have been observed despite implementation of strict health policies. Decisions for such sanitary measures are based on population health monitoring. Unfortunately  for COVID-19  a significant proportion of individuals are asymptomatic but play a role in the virus transmission. To overcome these limitations  several strategies were developed including genome quantification in wastewater that could allow monitoring of the health status of population  since shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stool is frequent. Wastewater-based epidemiology  WBE  was established and several countries implemented this approach to allow COVID-19 outbreak monitoring. In France  the OBEPINE project performed a quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater samples collected from major wastewater treatment plants  WWTP  since March 2020. In the greater Paris area 1101 samples  507 for five WWTP and 594 for sewer  were collected. This 16 months monitoring allows us to observe the outbreak dynamics. Comparison of WBE indicators with health data lead to several important observation; the good level of correlation with incidence rates  the average 3 days lead time  and the sensitivity  WBE change when incidence is > to 7 100000 inhabitants . We also compared the local monitoring  city level  with the regional monitoring  to help cluster identification. Moreover  variants of concern  VOC  emerged due to the selection pressure. We developed a specific RT-qPCR method targeting the deletion H69-V70 in the spike protein  using this deletion as a proxy of the B.1.1.7 presence in the wastewater. With this data we demonstrate the predominant role played by this strain in the third wave. All these results allow a better description and understanding of the pandemic and highlight the role of such WBE indicators.

To mitigate the B.1.617.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2  deciphering the protein structure and immunological responses by employing bioinformatics tools for data mining and analysis is pivotal. OBJECTIVES: Here  an in silico approach was employed for deciphering the structure and immune function of the subunit of spike  S  protein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant. METHODS: The partial amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant S protein was analyzed  and its putative secondary and tertiary structure was predicted. Immunogenic analyses including B- and T-cell epitopes  interferon-gamma  IFN-γ  response  chemokine  and protective antigens for SARS-CoV 2 S proteins were predicted using appropriate tools. RESULTS: B.1.617.1 variant S protein sequence was found to be highly stable and amphipathic. ABCpred and CTLpred analyses led to the identification of two potential antigenic B cell and T cell epitopes with starting amino acid positions at 60 and 82  for B cell epitopes  and 54 and 98  for T cell epitopes  having prediction scores > 0.8. Further  RAMPAGE tool was used for determining the allowed and disallowed regions of the three-dimensional predicted structure of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant S protein. CONCLUSION: Together  the in silico analysis revealed the predicted structure of partial S protein  immunogenic properties  and possible regions for S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and provides a valuable prelude for engineering the targeted vaccine or drug against B.1.617.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

These variants of concern  VOC  are known for increased transmissibility and can also be responsible for avoiding immune responses. The gold standard to detect VOC is sequencing  however routine genomic surveillance in resource-limited countries like Pakistan is not always readily available. The inadvertent detection of the B.1.1.7  United Kingdom  VOC by a target failure due to the key deletion in spike Δ69-70 by commercially available PCR assay helps to understand target failures as an alternative approach to detect variants. In pursuit of VOC it was further discovered that a deletion in the ORF1a gene  ORF1a Δ3675-3677  is common in B.1.1.7  B.1.351  South African   and P.1  Brazilian  VOC. The Real-Time Quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  assay can distinguish target failures and can discriminate SARS-CoV-2 VOC. The study uses positive samples archived in respective labs. Samples were divided into two groups. Group I constitutes 261 positive samples out of total of 16 964  1.53%  performed from August till September 2020  while group II consists of 3501 positive samples out of a total of 46 041  7.60%  performed  from November 2020 till January 2021. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that no VOC was present in positive samples of group I. However  a staggering difference in results was noted in group II where the positivity ratio increased exponentially and the VOC started appearing in significant numbers  53.64% . This concludes that the third wave in Pakistan is due to the importation of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We investigated if single dose vaccination  with or without prior infection  confers cross protective immunity to variants. We analyzed T and B cell responses after first dose vaccination with the Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in healthcare workers  HCW  followed longitudinally  with or without prior Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. After one dose  individuals with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity  antibody secreting memory B cell response to spike and neutralizing antibodies effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. By comparison  HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior infection showed reduced immunity against variants. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike mutations resulted in increased  abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte antigen  HLA  polymorphisms. Single dose vaccination with BNT162b2 in the context of prior infection with a heterologous variant substantially enhances neutralizing antibody responses against variants.

Here  we developed an mRNA vaccine based on the trimeric receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein fused to ferritin-formed nanoparticles  TF-RBD . Compared to the trimeric form of the RBD mRNA vaccine  T-RBD   TF-RBD delivered intramuscularly elicited robust and durable humoral immunity as well as a Th1-biased cellular response. After further challenge with live SARS-CoV-2  immunization with a two-shot low-dose regimen of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in hACE2-transduced mice. In addition  the mRNA template of TF-RBD was easily and quickly engineered into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The TF-RBD multivalent vaccine produced broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Beta  B.1.351  variants. This mRNA vaccine based on the encoded self-assembled nanoparticle-based trimer RBD provides a reference for the design of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.

These N-glycans are predicted to modulate spike binding to the host receptor by stabilizing its open conformation and host immunity evasion. Here  we investigated the essentiality of both the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection. Ablation of host N-glycosylation using RNA interference or inhibitors  including FDA-approved drugs  reduced the spread of the infection  including that of variants B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta . Under these conditions  cells produced fewer virions and some completely lost their infectivity. Furthermore  partial enzymatic deglycosylation of intact virions showed that surface-exposed N-glycans are critical for cell invasion. Altogether  we propose protein N-glycosylation as a targetable pathway with clinical potential for treatment of COVID-19.

The continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants present a major challenge to the development of antiviral agents and vaccines. In this study  we identified that EK1 and cholesterol-coupled derivative of EK1  EK1C4  as pan-CoV fusion inhibitors  exhibit potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both lung- and intestine-derived cell lines  Calu-3 and Caco2  respectively . They are also effective against infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.1.248  Gamma  as well as those with mutations in S protein  including N417T  E484K  N501Y  and D614G  which are common in South African and Brazilian variants. Crystal structure revealed that EK1 targets the HR1 domain in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to block virus-cell fusion and provide mechanistic insights into its broad and effective antiviral activity. Nasal administration of EK1 peptides to hACE2 transgenic mice significantly reduced viral titers in lung and intestinal tissues. EK1 showed good safety profiles in various animal models  supporting further clinical development of EK1-based pan-CoV fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Here we investigated Omicron escape from neutralization by antibodies from South African individuals vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We used blood samples taken soon after vaccination from individuals who were vaccinated and previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with no evidence of previous infection. We isolated and sequence-confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person and observed that Omicron requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor to infect cells. We compared plasma neutralization of Omicron relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and found that neutralization of ancestral virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated individuals compared with the vaccinated-only participants. However  both groups showed a 22-fold reduction in vaccine-elicited neutralization by the Omicron variant. Participants who were vaccinated and had previously been infected exhibited residual neutralization of Omicron similar to the level of neutralization of the ancestral virus observed in the vaccination-only group. These data support the notion that reasonable protection against Omicron may be maintained using vaccination approaches.

Marine resources are not explored much and to be taken into consideration for exploring antiviral potential. Chitosan  carbohydrate polymer  is one such bioactive glycan found ubiquitously in marine organisms. The presence of reactive amine hydroxyl groups  with low toxicity allergenicity  compels us to explore it against SARS-CoV-2. We have screened a library of chitosan derivatives by site-specific docking at not only spike protein Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  of wild type SARS-CoV-2 but also on RBD of B.1.1.7  UK  and P.1  Brazil  SARS-CoV-2 variants. The obtained result was very interesting and ranks N-benzyl-O-acetyl-chitosan  Imino-chitosan  Sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharides derivatives as a potent antiviral candidate due to its high binding affinity of the ligands  -6.0 to -6.6 kcal mol  with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and they critically interacting with amino acid residues Tyr 449  Asn 501  Tyr 501  Gln 493  Gln 498 and some other site-specific residues associated with higher transmissibility and severe infection. Further ADMET analysis was done and found significant for exploration of the future therapeutic potential of these three ligands. The obtained results are highly encouraging in support for consideration and exploration in further clinical studies of these chitosan derivatives as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

In response  these countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Using data from Clalit Health Services  which provides mandatory health-care coverage for over half of the Israeli population  individuals receiving a third vaccine dose between July 30  2020  and Sept 23  2021  were matched  1:1  to demographically and clinically similar controls who did not receive a third dose. Eligible participants had received the second vaccine dose at least 5 months before the recruitment date  had no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection  and had no contact with the health-care system in the 3 days before recruitment. Individuals who are health-care workers  live in long-term care facilities  or are medically confined to their homes were excluded. Primary outcomes were COVID-19-related admission to hospital  severe disease  and COVID-19-related death. The third dose effectiveness for each outcome was estimated as 1 – risk ratio using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. FINDINGS: 1 158 269 individuals were eligible to be included in the third dose group. Following matching  the third dose and control groups each included 728 321 individuals. Participants had a median age of 52 years  IQR 37–68  and 51% were female. The median follow-up time was 13 days  IQR 6–21  in both groups. Vaccine effectiveness evaluated at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose  compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago  was estimated to be 93%  231 events for two doses vs 29 events for three doses; 95% CI 88–97  for admission to hospital  92%  157 vs 17 events; 82–97  for severe disease  and 81%  44 vs seven events; 59–97  for COVID-19-related death. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective in protecting individuals against severe COVID-19-related outcomes  compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago.

We also tested the utility of next-generation sequencing  NGS  for diagnosis of COVID-19. Saliva  NP and SN swabs were collected from subjects who presented with acute respiratory infection  their asymptomatic roommates  and prior confirmed cases who were undergoing isolation at a community care facility in June 2020. All samples were tested using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based NGS with phylogenetic analysis was done for 30 samples. We recruited 200 subjects  of which 91 and 46 were tested twice and thrice respectively. In total  62.0%  44.5%  and 37.7% of saliva  NP and SN samples were positive. Cycle threshold  Ct  values were lower during the earlier period of infection across all sample types. The percentage of test-positive saliva was higher than NP and SN swabs. We found a strong correlation between viral genome coverage by NGS and Ct values for SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analyses revealed Clade O and lineage B.6 known to be circulating in Singapore. We found saliva to be a sensitive and viable sample for COVID-19 diagnosis.

The average US veteran is a male older than the general US population. SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to cause poorer outcomes among men and older adults  making the veteran population an especially vulnerable group for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate clinical and virologic factors impacting COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective chart review included 476 veterans in six New England states with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between April and September 2020. Whole genome sequencing was performed on SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from these veterans  and the correlation of genomic data to clinical outcomes was evaluated. Clinical and demographic variables were collected by manual chart review and were correlated to the end points of peak disease severity  based on oxygenation requirements   hospitalization  and mortality using multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 476 veterans  274 had complete and accessible charts. Of the 274 veterans  92.7%  n=254  were men and 83.2%  n=228  were White  and the mean age was 63 years. In the multivariate regression  significant predictors of hospitalization  C statistic 0.75  were age  odds ratio [OR] 1.05  95% CI 1.03-1.08  and non-White race  OR 2.39  95% CI 1.13-5.01 . Peak severity  C statistic 0.70  also varied by age  OR 1.07  95% CI 1.03-1.11  and O2 requirement on admission  OR 45.7  95% CI 18.79-111 . Mortality  C statistic 0.87  was predicted by age  OR 1.06  95% CI 1.01-1.11   dementia  OR 3.44  95% CI 1.07-11.1   and O2 requirement on admission  OR 6.74  95% CI 1.74-26.1 . Most  291 299  97.3%  of our samples were dominated by the spike protein D614G substitution and were from SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage or one of 37 different B.1 sublineages  with none representing more than 8.7%  26 299  of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of veterans from the six New England states with a mean age of 63 years and a high comorbidity burden  age was the largest predictor of hospitalization  peak disease severity  and mortality. Non-White veterans were more likely to be hospitalized  and patients who required oxygen on admission were more likely to have severe disease and higher rates of mortality. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages were distributed in patients in New England early in the COVID-19 era  mostly related to viruses from New York State with D614G mutation.

However  Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system  and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border  and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela  and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. METHODS: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal  NP  clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages ‘Pangolin’ tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally  the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. RESULTS: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage  and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene  D614G substitution   previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity  in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations  R203K G204R substitution  were present in the nucleocapsid  N  gene of one Venezuelan genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil  consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.

Two cohorts of positive patients were compared. The Alpha group consisted of 11 135 subjects diagnosed between 21 March and 21 April 2021  and the Delta group consisted of 499 positive subjects diagnosed between 21 July and 21 August 2021. A descriptive and statistical analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups was performed. The proportion of patients with mild and moderate infections was significantly higher in the Delta than in the Alpha group  p < 0.001 . In fully vaccinated patients  the proportion of symptomatic individuals was significantly higher in the Delta than in the Alpha group. The Delta group showed odds ratios of 3.08  95% CI  2.55–3.72  for symptomatic infection and 2.66  95% CI  1.76–3.94  for hospitalization. Improving COVID-19 vaccination rates is a priority  since infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has a significant impact on patient outcomes. Additional targeted prevention strategies such as social distancing  the use of masks in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status  and the use of a sanitary passport could be crucial to contain further spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: the affinity scores of the spike receptor-binding domain  S-RBD  of B.1.1.7  B. 1.351  B.1.617  and P.1 variants in interaction with the neutralizing antibody  CV30 isolated from a patient   and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  receptor were predicted using the template-based computational modeling. From the Nextstrain global database  we identified prevalent mutations of S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 to April 2021. Pre- and post-vaccination time series forecasting models were developed based on the prediction of neutralizing antibody affinity scores for S-RBD of the variants. Results: the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant in North America is growing rapidly  but the rate will reduce due to high affinity  ~90%  to the neutralizing antibody once herd immunity is reached. Currently  the rates of isolation of B. 1.351  B.1.617  and P.1 variants are slowly increasing in North America. Herd immunity is able to relatively control these variants due to their low affinity  ~70%  to the neutralizing antibody. The S-RBD of B.1.617 has a 110% increased affinity score to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  in comparison to the wild-type structure  making it highly infectious. Conclusion: The newly emerged B.1.351  B.1.617  and P.1 variants escape from vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and continue circulating in North America in post- herd immunity era. Our study strongly suggests that a third dose of vaccine is urgently needed to cover novel variants with affinity scores  equal or less than 70%  to eliminate developing viral mutations and reduce transmission rates.

This is unexpected for a virus with a low mutation rate due to an inherent proof-reading system. Could such a variant arise under very special conditions occurring in a host where the virus replicates and mutates in a rather unlimited fashion  such as in immune compromised patients? The virus was shown to replicate in an immunosuppressed cancer patient for more than 105 days and might be a source of new variants. These patients are asymptomatic and the virus may therefore escape detection and attention and be high-risk. Similarly  HIV-infected individuals may be immunocompromised and support coronavirus replication with increased mutation rates. The patients may promote “within-host evolution”. Some of the viruses present in such a highly mutagenic swarm or quasispecies within one patient may become founders and cause a pandemic by further “between-host evolution”. B.1.1.7 with 23 mutations may be such a case. Immunosuppressed patients can be identified and treated by the synthetic antibody cocktails as passive immunization and kept under control. Immunosuppressed patients can be easily identified and supervised by healthcare workers—once they become aware of the risk—to avoid new variants with pandemic potential.

The animal was SARS-CoV-2 positive on serology. The other cat living in the same household  Cat-2  never showed any clinical sign but was also confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive on serology. Both cats were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative. Cat-1 had closer contact than Cat-2 with their owner  who had been in close contact with a coworker tested PCR positive for COVID-19  Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant  4 weeks before Cat-1's first episode of congestive heart failure. A focused point-of-care echocardiography at presentation revealed for Cat-1 numerous B-lines  pleural effusion  severe left atrial dilation and dysfunction  and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype associated with focal pulmonary consolidations. Both myocarditis and pneumonia were suspected  leading to the prescription of cardiac medications and antibiotics. One month later  Cat-1 recovered  with normalization of left atrial size and function  and radiographic and echocardiography disappearance of heart failure signs and pulmonary lesions. An extensive literature review of SARS-CoV-2-related cardiac injury in pets in comparison with human pathology is discussed.

We show that convalescent-phase sera neutralize pseudotyped viruses with the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.1.248  COH.20G 677H  20A.EU2  and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor loss in titer. Similarly  antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer  an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses  and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by natural infection and by the Pfizer vaccine will maintain protection against the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.1.248 variants but that monoclonal antibody therapy may be less effective for patients infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2.

Despite the unprecedented pace of vaccine development  with six vaccines already in use worldwide  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 ‘variants of concern’  VOC  across diverse geographic locales suggests herd immunity may fail to eliminate the virus. All three officially designated VOC carry Spike  S  polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited during initial waves of the pandemic. Here  we characterize the biological consequences of the ensemble of S mutations present in VOC lineages B.1.1.7  501Y.V1  and B.1.351  501Y.V2 . Using a replication-competent EGFP-reporter vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  system  rcVSV-CoV2-S  which encodes S from SARS coronavirus 2 in place of VSV-G  and coupled with a clonal HEK-293T ACE2 TMPRSS2 cell line optimized for highly efficient S-mediated infection  we determined that 8 out of 12  67%  serum samples from a cohort of recipients of the Gamaleya Sputnik V Ad26   Ad5 vaccine showed dose response curve slopes indicative of failure to neutralize rcVSV-CoV2-S: B.1.351. The same set of sera efficiently neutralized S from B.1.1.7 and showed only moderately reduced activity against S carrying the E484K substitution alone. Taken together  our data suggest that control of emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may benefit from updated vaccines.

The key to understanding the global success of SARS-CoV-2 is hidden in its genome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved data for 329 942 SARS-CoV-2 records uploaded to the GISAID database from the beginning of the pandemic until the January 8  2021. A Python variant detection script was developed to process the data using pairwise2 from the BioPython library. Sequence alignments were performed for every gene separately  except ORF1ab  which was not studied . Genomes less than 26 000 nucleotides long were excluded from the research. Clustering was performed using HDBScan. RESULTS: Here  we addressed the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 using 329 942 samples. The analysis yielded 155 SNPs and deletions in more than 0.3% of the sequences. Clustering results suggested that a proportion of people  2.46%  was infected with a distinct subtype of the B.1.1.7 variant  which contained four to six additional mutations  G28881A  G28882A  G28883С  A23403G  A28095T  G25437T . Two clusters were formed by mutations in the samples uploaded predominantly by Denmark and Australia  1.48% and 2.51%  respectively . A correlation coefficient matrix detected 160 pairs of mutations  correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 . We also addressed the completeness of the GISAID database  patient gender  and age. Finally  we found ORF6 and E to be the most conserved genes  96.15% and 94.66% of the sequences totally match the reference  respectively . Our results indicate multiple areas for further research in both SARS-CoV-2 studies and health science.

Mutant lineages of the virus have concerned scientists because of convergent amino acid alterations  mainly on the viral spike protein. Studies have shown that mutants have diminished activity of neutralizing antibodies and enhanced affinity with its human cell receptor  the ACE2 protein. METHODS: Hence  for real-time measuring of the impacts caused by variant strains in such complexes  we implemented E-Volve  a tool designed to model a structure with a list of mutations requested by users and return analyses of the variant protein. As a proof of concept  we scrutinized the spike-antibody and spike-ACE2 complexes formed in the variants of concern  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   and P.1  Gamma   by using contact maps depicting the interactions made amid them  along with heat maps to quantify these major interactions. RESULTS: The results found in this study depict the highly frequent interface changes made by the entire set of mutations  mainly conducted by N501Y and E484K. In the spike-Antibody complex  we have noticed alterations concerning electrostatic surface complementarity  breaching essential sites in the P17 and BD-368-2 antibodies. Alongside  the spike-ACE2 complex has presented new hydrophobic bonds. DISCUSSION: Molecular dynamics simulations followed by Poisson-Boltzmann calculations corroborate the higher complementarity to the receptor and lower to the antibodies for the K417T E484K N501Y  Gamma  mutant compared to the wild-type strain  as pointed by E-Volve  as well as an intensification of this effect by changes at the protein conformational equilibrium in solution. A local disorder of the loop α1′ β1′  as well its possible effects on the affinity to the BD-368-2 antibody were also incorporated to the final conclusions after this analysis. Moreover  E-Volve can depict the main alterations in important biological structures  as shown in the SARS-CoV-2 complexes  marking a major step in the real-time tracking of the virus mutant lineages.

At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences  n = 1756  of Delta  B.1.617.2  and Delta Plus  AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1  variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations  ≥20 %  in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome  their co-existence  and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations  ≥20 %  than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike  G142D  A222V  and T95I  existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike  K417N  V70F  and W258L  were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a  A1146T   which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore  five key mutations  T95I  A222V  G142D  R158G  and K417N  were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus  which first emerged in India  reached the United States through England and Japan  followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here  it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles  and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.

Here  the antibody response to the 501Y.V2 variant was examined in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in early 2021 - when over 90% of infections in South Africa were attributed to 501Y.V2. Robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers to the 501Y.V2 variant were detected and these binding antibodies showed high levels of cross-reactivity for the original variant  from the first wave. In contrast to an earlier study where sera from individuals infected with the original variant showed dramatically reduced potency against 501Y.V2  sera from 501Y.V2-infected patients maintained good cross-reactivity against viruses from the first wave. Furthermore  sera from 501Y.V2-infected patients also neutralized the 501Y.V3  P.1  variant first described in Brazil  and now circulating globally. Collectively these data suggest that the antibody response in patients infected with 501Y.V2 has a broad specificity and that vaccines designed with the 501Y.V2 sequence may elicit more cross-reactive responses.

These phytochemicals were docked with the spike protein of the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  and Delta-Plus  AY.1  variant of SARS-CoV-2 using Autodock Vina and MOE 09. The target proteins were constructed by homology modeling using Swiss-Model. Hydroxychloroquine  taken as a standard in docking analysis  exhibited a binding energy of −6.5 kcal mol and −6.1 kcal mol with respect to the Delta variant and Delta-Plus variant respectively. Among the 50 docked results most flavones showed very good docking scores. 3 5 8-Trimethoxy-6 7 4 5-bis methylenedioxy flavone  a Poly-Methoxyflavone  produced a highest docking score of −8.7 kcal mol with respect to both the spike protein targets. Poly-Methoxyflavones and Poly-Ethoxyflavones exhibited good binding affinity for the target spike protein of SARS-CoV-2  and can be potential anti-viral drug candidates against the existing Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2.

This highlights a critical need to discover new therapeutic agents to overcome the variants mutations. Despite the availability of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies has been considered as an alternative way for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 variants infection. Here  we show that the nasal delivery of two previously characterized broadly neutralizing antibodies  F61 and H121  protected K18-hACE2 mice against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 variants. The broadly protective efficacy of the F61 or F61 F121 cocktail antibodies was evaluated by lethal challenge with the wild strain  WIV04  and multiple variants  including beta  B.1.351   delta  B.1.617.2   and omicron  B.1.1.529  at 200 or 1000 TCID 50   and the minimum antibody administration doses  5–1.25 mg kg body weight  were also evaluated with delta and omicron challenge. Fully prophylactic protections were found in all challenged groups with both F61 and F61 H121 combination at the administration dose of 20 mg kg body weight  and corresponding mice lung viral RNA showed negative  with almost all alveolar septa and cavities remaining normal. Furthermore  low-dose antibody treatment induced significant prophylactic protection against lethal challenge with delta and omicron variants  whereas the F61 H121 combination showed excellent results against omicron infection. Our findings indicated the potential use of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies as prophylactic and therapeutic agent for protection of current emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants infection.

Here  we assessed the coronavirus disease  COVID-19 -related diagnostic workload during the onset of the pandemic in the central laboratory of Benin  Western Africa; characterized 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from returning travelers; and validated the Da An RT-PCR-based diagnostic kit that is widely used across Africa. We found a 15-fold increase in the monthly laboratory workload due to COVID-19  dealt with at the cost of routine activities. Genomic surveillance showed near-simultaneous introduction of distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages termed A.4 and B.1  including the D614G spike protein variant potentially associated with higher transmissibility from travelers from six different European and African countries during March-April 2020. We decoded the target regions within the ORF1ab and N genes of the Da An dual-target kit by MinION-based amplicon sequencing. Despite relatively high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses  HCoVs  within the ORF1ab target domain  no cross-detection of high-titered cell culture supernatants of HCoVs was observed  suggesting high analytical specificity. The Da An kit was highly sensitive  detecting 3.2 to 9.0 copies of target-specific in vitro transcripts reaction. Although discrepant test results were observed in low-titered clinical samples  clinical sensitivity of the Da An kit was at least comparable to that of commercial kits from affluent settings. In sum  virologic diagnostics are achievable in a resource-limited setting  but unprecedented pressure resulting from COVID-19-related diagnostics requires rapid and sustainable support of national and supranational stakeholders addressing limited laboratory capacity. IMPORTANCE Months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  case numbers from Africa are surprisingly low  potentially because the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Africa is lower than in other regions. Here  we show an overload of COVID-19-related diagnostics in the central laboratory of Benin  Western Africa  with a stagnating average number of positive samples irrespective of daily sample counts. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance confirmed a high genomic diversity in Benin introduced by travelers returning from Europe and other African countries  including early circulation of the D614G spike mutation associated with potentially higher transmissibility. We validated a widely used RT-PCR kit donated by the Chinese Jack Ma Foundation and confirmed high analytical specificity and clinical sensitivity equivalent to tests used in affluent settings. Our assessment shows that although achievable in an African setting  the burden from COVID-19-related diagnostics on national reference laboratories is very high.

We analysed the first 2 623 BA.2 cases from 29 November 2021 to 2 January 2022. No epidemiological or clinical differences were found between individuals infected with BA.1 versus BA.2. Phylogenetic analyses showed a geographic east-to-west transmission of BA.2 from the Capital Region with clusters expanding after the Christmas holidays. Mutational analysis shows distinct differences between BA.1 and BA.2.

Whether natural immunity induced by the original SARS-CoV-2 WA1 2020 strain protects against rechallenge with these SARS-CoV-2 variants remains a critical unresolved question. In this study  we show that natural immunity induced by the WA1 2020 strain leads to partial but incomplete protection against the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.351  beta  in rhesus macaques. We challenged rhesus macaques with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and showed that infection with these variants resulted in high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract. We then infected rhesus macaques with the WA1 2020 strain and rechallenged them on day 35 with the WA1 2020  B.1.1.7  or B.1.351 variants. Natural immunity to WA1 2020 led to robust protection against rechallenge with WA1 2020 but only partial protection against rechallenge with B.1.351. An intermediate degree of protection was observed in rhesus macaques against rechallenge with B.1.1.7. These data demonstrate partial but incomplete protective efficacy of natural immunity induced by WA1 2020 against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Our findings have important implications for both vaccination and public health strategies in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined > 383 500 complete SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID  Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data  with sampling dates extending until April 05  2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom  South Africa  Brazil  United States  India  Russia  France  Spain  Germany  and China. Among the 77 to 100 novel mutations  some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time. VUI2012 01  B.1.1.7  and 501Y.V2  B.1.351   the so‐called UK and South Africa variants  respectively  and two variants from Brazil  484K.V2  now called P.1 and P.2  increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns  worldwide active replication in genetically and socio‐economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS‐CoV‐2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants  capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines  therapies  and diagnostic tests.

We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21  2020  1578 cases . We obtained 91 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into seven lineages  Pangolin lineages—A  B  B.1  B.1.80  B.1.1  B.4  and B.6 . The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China  Southeast Asia  Iran  Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 17 contact clusters and 24 cases with no known contacts. We found 14 of the 17 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus  consistent with multiple introductions and most  12 17  were contained within a single district  reflecting local spread. In most of the 17 clusters  the index case  12 17  and spreaders  11 17  were symptomatic. Of the 91 sequences  47 belonged to the B.6 lineage  including eleven of 24 cases with no known contact  indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka suggests multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution. This is the first study from India combining genomic data with epidemiological information emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to outbreak response.

During the quarantine  his 1st  4th  7th  and 14th days of specimens returned negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   which causes coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . On December 11  he completed 14 days of centralized isolation and returned to Guangzhou from Shanghai via airplane  then he was closed-loop transferred to Yuexiu District for a 7-day home isolation. On December 12  the local Community Health Service Center routinely collected his throat swab and the result returned to COVID-19 positive on December 13  2021. He was transported to the Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital for isolated treatment by negative pressure ambulance on the same day. The patient had two inflamed lungs according to the chest computed tomography  CT  examination  but his most recently updated condition was stable. An estimated 600 close contacts were identified and were placed in centralized isolation. On December 16  one of the close contacts  a 70-year-old female also tested positive for COVID-19. She lived on the lower floor of the same type of apartment as the imported case and spent 19 hours in the same building. On December 13  2021  the nasal swab was sequenced using both Nanopore GridION by Guangzhou CDC and Illumina MiniSeq by Guangdong CDC. The viral RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using ULSEN® 2019-nCoV Whole Genome Capture Kit  Beijing MicroFuture Technology Co.  Ltd  Beijing  China  V-090418 . Then  the sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit  Illumina  Inc.  San Diego  USA  FC-131-1001  and were conducted by Illumina sequencing. On December 14  2021  the sequencing analysis concluded that the virus genome belonged to lineage B.1.1.529  VOC Omicron. The Omicron  B.1.1.529  variant was reportedly first discovered on November 9  2021  in Botswana in southern Africa  1   and then gradually spread in South Africa  becoming the dominant strain in South Africa. On November 26  2021  it was listed by the World Health Organization  WHO  as a Variant of Concern  VOC   2 . The Omicron variant is a highly divergent variant with a high number of mutations  including position 26–32 in the spike protein  some of which are concerning and may be associated with immune escape potential and higher transmissibility. As of December 9  2021  human infections with this variant have been identified in 63 countries  3 . Compared with the Wuhan reference sequence  EPI_ISL_402119   4   the strain from the case displayed 59 nucleotide variation sites. The sequence reported on the evolutionary branch is most similar to those reported in England on December 4  2021  Figure 1 . Furthermore  48 amino acid mutation sites and 16 amino acid deletions were detected in the protein that corresponded to the features of the VOC Omicron variant  B.1.1.529.1 . Researchers have established the existence of 2 variants of Omicron. The ‘standard’ variant is now referred to as BA.1 B.1.1.529.1  and a second variant of Omicron known as BA.2 B.1.1.529.2. BA.2 has been nicknamed ‘Stealth Omicron’ because it differs from the ‘standard’ variety by not having the characteristic SGTF-causing deletion  Δ69–70   5 . In this study  the variant has deletion  Δ69–70  and belongs to sublineage BA.1 B.1.1.529.1.

However  the structure-function analysis of potent human anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies and its links to the formulation of antibody cocktails remains largely elusive. Methods: Previously  we isolated a panel of neutralizing anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients and showed their neutralization efficacy in vitro. Here  we elucidate the mechanism of action of antibodies and dissect antibodies at the epitope level  which leads to a formation of a potent antibody cocktail. Results: We found that representative antibodies which target non-overlapping epitopes are effective against wild type virus and recently emerging variants of concern  whilst being encoded by antibody genes with few somatic mutations. Neutralization is associated with the inhibition of binding of viral RBD to ACE2 and possibly of the subsequent fusion process. Structural analysis of representative antibodies  by cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography  reveals that they have some unique aspects that are of potential value while sharing some features in common with previously reported neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. For instance  one has a common VH 3-53 public variable region yet is unusually resilient to mutation at residue 501 of the RBD. We evaluate the in vivo efficacy of an antibody cocktail consisting of two potent non-competing anti-RBD antibodies in a Syrian hamster model. We demonstrate that the cocktail prevents weight loss  reduces lung viral load and attenuates pulmonary inflammation in hamsters in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Although neutralization of one of these antibodies is abrogated by the mutations of variant B.1.351  it is also possible to produce a bi-valent cocktail of antibodies both of which are resilient to variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. Conclusions: These findings support the up-to-date and rational design of an anti-RBD antibody cocktail as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19.

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain  NTD  of the S protein  HV69-70del and Y144del  also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions . We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns  characterized by Membrane  M  protein mutations  including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the US that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date  this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states  including Hawaii. As of April 2021  it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggest this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7  HV69-70del and Y144del. It is surface exposed and may alter NTD tertiary configuration or accessibility  and thus has the potential to affect neutralization by NTD directed antibodies.

We now report persistence of antibodies up to 6 months after vaccination  and cross-neutralization titers against 3 variants of concern  VoCs . METHODS: In a phase 1 study  adult  18–54 years of age  and elderly  55–75 years of age  volunteers received 2 vaccinations 21 days apart with placebo or 3-  9-  or 30-µg. We measured immunoglobulin G  IgG  antibodies against SCB-2019  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  competitive binding antibodies  and neutralizing antibodies against wild-type SARS-CoV-2  Wuhan-Hu-1  at days 101 and 184  and neutralizing antibodies against 3 VoCs  Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Gamma  P.1   in day 36 sera. RESULTS: Titers waned from their peak at days 36–50  but SCB-2019 IgG antibodies  ACE2 competitive binding antibodies  and neutralizing antibodies against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 persisted at 25%–35% of their observed peak levels at day 184. Day 36 sera also demonstrated dose-dependent increases in neutralizing titers against the 3 VoCs. CONCLUSIONS: SCB-2019 dose-dependently induced immune responses against wild-type SARS-CoV-2  which persisted up to day 184. Neutralizing antibodies were cross-reactive against 3 of the most prevalent VoCs.

Convalescent sera after infection with variants of concern  VOCs: B.1.1.7  n = 10; B.1.351  n = 1  and sera from 100 vaccinees  Pfizer BioNTech  BNT162b2  n = 33; Moderna  mRNA-1273  n = 11; AstraZeneca  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222  n = 56  were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G  IgG  directed against the viral spike  S -protein  its receptor-binding domain  RBD   the nucleoprotein  N  and for virus-neutralizing antibodies  VNA . For the latter  surrogate assays  sVNT  and a Vero-cell based neutralization test  cVNT  were used. Maturity of IgG was determined by measuring the avidity in an immunoblot  IB . Past VOC infection resulted in a broad reactivity of anti-S IgG  100%   anti-RBD IgG  100%   and anti-N IgG  91%   while latter were absent in 99% of vaccinees. Starting approximately two weeks after the first vaccine dose  anti-S IgG  75–100%  and particularly anti-RBD IgG  98–100%  were detectable. After the second dose  their titers increased and were higher than in the convalescents. The sVNT showed evidence of VNA in 91% of convalescents and in 80–100% 100% after first second vaccine dose  respectively. After the second dose  an increase in VNA titer and IgGs of high avidity were demonstrated by cVNT and IB  respectively. Re-vaccination contributes to a more robust immune response.

Therefore  we investigated the possibility of aerosol SARS-CoV-2 transmission within an apartment complex where residents reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite having no direct contact with other SARS-CoV-2–infected people. METHODS: Information on symptom onset and exposure history of the patients was collected by global positioning system  GPS  tracking to investigate possible points of contact or spread. Samples collected from patients and from various areas of the complex were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Of 19 people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  5 reported no direct contact with other residents and were from apartments in the same vertical line. Eight environmental samples tested positive for the virus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 3 of the positive cases and 1 environmental sample belonged to the B.1.497 lineage. Additionally  3 clinical specimens and 1 environmental sample from each floor of the complex had the same amino acid substitution in the ORF1ab region. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 transmission possibly occurs between different floors of an apartment building through aerosol transmission via nonfunctioning drain traps.

The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological links between the outbreaks using whole genome sequencing  WGS  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 . METHODS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study  including four non-outbreak  A1–A4  and three outbreak cases  A5–A7  in hospital A and eight cases  S1–S8  in hospital S. Patients' hospital stays  COVID-19 symptoms  and transfer history were reviewed. RNA samples were submitted for WGS and genome-wide single nucleotide variants and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. RESULTS: The index patient  A5  in hospital A was transferred from hospital S on 26 March. Patients A6 and A7 were the family caregiver and sister  respectively  of the patient who shared a room with A5 for 4 days. Prior to transfer  A5 was at the next bed to S8 in the emergency room on 25 March. Patient S6  a professional caregiver  took care of the patient in the room next to S8's room for 5 days until 22 March and then S5 for another 3 days. WGS revealed that SARS-CoV-2 in A2  A3  and A4 belong to clades V B.2  S A  and G B.1  respectively  whereas that of A5–A7 and S1-S5 are of the V B.2.1 clade and closely clustered. In particular  SARS-CoV-2 in patients A5 and S5 showed perfect identity. CONCLUSION: WGS is a useful tool to understand epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. It is the first study to elucidate the role of patient transfer and caregivers as links of nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 in multiple hospitals.

However  ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here we completely map all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain  RBD  that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody  LY-CoV555  and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages  E484K escapes LY-CoV555  K417N T escape LY-CoV016 . Additionally  the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore  we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts should diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

Studies of transmission of the virus carried out in animals have suggested that certain animals may be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in pets  18 cats and 20 dogs  from owners previously confirmed as COVID-19-positive. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were taken and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assays  while blood samples were taken for antibody detection. Of the total pets analyzed  one cat was found reactive to SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR of an oropharyngeal and a rectal swab. This cat presented only sneezing as a clinical sign. Serological analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies in the serum sample from this cat  as well as in the serum from another cat non-reactive to real-time RT-PCR. Complete sequence and phylogenetic analysis allowed determining that the SARS-CoV-2 genome belonged to the B.1.499 lineage. This lineage has been reported in different provinces of Argentina  mainly in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. This study notifies the first detection of the natural infection and molecular analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat from Argentina whose owner where COVID-19-positive. Although there is currently no evidence that cats can spread COVID-19  results suggest that health authorities should test pets with COVID-19-positive owners.

Methods In the single-arm  open-label  phase 3B implementation Sisonke study  health-care workers aged 18 years and older were invited for vaccination at one of 122 vaccination sites nationally. Participants received a single dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccinated participants were linked with their person-level data from one of two national medical insurance schemes  scheme A and scheme B  and matched for COVID-19 risk with an unvaccinated member of the general population. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19  defined as COVID-19-related admission to hospital  hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care  or death  in health-care workers compared with the general population  ascertained 28 days or more after vaccination or matching  up to data cutoff. This study is registered with the South African National Clinical Trial Registry  DOH-27-022021-6844  ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04838795  and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry  PACTR202102855526180  and is closed to accrual. Findings Between Feb 17 and May 17  2021  477 102 health-care workers were enrolled and vaccinated  of whom 357 401  74·9%  were female and 119 701  25·1%  were male  with a median age of 42·0 years  33·0–51·0 . 215 813 vaccinated individuals were matched with 215 813 unvaccinated individuals. As of data cutoff  July 17  2021   vaccine effectiveness derived from the total matched cohort was 83%  95% CI 75–89  to prevent COVID-19-related deaths  75%  69–82  to prevent COVID-19-related hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care  and 67%  62–71  to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations. The vaccine effectiveness for all three outcomes were consistent across scheme A and scheme B. The vaccine effectiveness was maintained in older health-care workers and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. During the course of the study  the beta  B.1.351  and then the delta  B.1.617.2  SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns were dominant  and vaccine effectiveness remained consistent  for scheme A plus B vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospital admission during beta wave was 62% [95% CI 42–76] and during delta wave was 67% [62–71]  and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related death during beta wave was 86% [57–100] and during delta wave was 82% [74–89] . Interpretation The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination  and against both beta and delta variants  providing real-world evidence for its use globally.

Here  we analyze deletions in the ORF7a of the N.7 lineage  a unique Uruguayan clade from the Brazilian B.1.1.33 lineage. Thirteen samples collected during the early SARS-CoV-2 wave in Uruguay had deletions in the ORF7a. Complete genomes were obtained by Illumina next-generation sequencing  and deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and capillary electrophoresis. The N.7 lineage includes several individuals with a 12-nucleotide deletion that removes four amino acids of the ORF7a. Notably  four individuals underwent an additional 68-nucleotide novel deletion that locates 44 nucleotides downstream in the terminal region of the same ORF7a. The simultaneous occurrence of the 12 and 68-nucleotide deletions fuses the ORF7a and ORF7b  two contiguous accessory genes that encode transmembrane proteins with immune-modulation activity. The fused ORF retains the signal peptide and the complete Ig-like fold of the 7a protein and the transmembrane domain of the 7b protein  suggesting that the fused protein plays similar functions to original proteins in a single format. Our findings evidence the remarkable dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility that single and consecutive deletions occur in accessory genes and promote changes in the genomic organization that help the virus explore genetic variations and select for new  higher fit changes.

A rapid screening tool using this mutation is important for surveillance during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic. We developed and validated a single nucleotide polymorphism real-time reverse transcription PCR assay using allelic discrimination of the spike gene N501Y mutation to screen for potential variants of concern and differentiate them from SARS-CoV-2 lineages without the N501Y mutation. A total of 160 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 were characterized as mutant  N501Y  or N501 wild type by Sanger sequencing and were subsequently tested with the N501Y single nucleotide polymorphism real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Our assay  compared to Sanger sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphism detection  demonstrated positive percent agreement of 100% for all 57 specimens displaying the N501Y mutation  which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be typed as A23063T  including one specimen with mixed signal for wild type and mutant. Negative percent agreement was 100% in all 103 specimens typed as N501 wild type  with A23063 identified as wild type by Sanger sequencing. The identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages carrying an N501Y mutation is critical for surveillance purposes. Current identification methods rely primarily on Sanger sequencing or whole-genome sequencing  which are time consuming  labor intensive  and costly. The assay described herein is an efficient tool for high-volume specimen screening for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and for selecting specimens for confirmatory Sanger or whole-genome sequencing. IMPORTANCE During the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  several variants of concern  VOCs  have been detected  for example  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617.2. The VOCs pose a threat to public health efforts to control the spread of the virus. As such  surveillance and monitoring of these VOCs is of the utmost importance. Our real-time RT-PCR assay helps with surveillance by providing an easy method to quickly survey SARS-CoV-2 specimens for VOCs carrying the N501Y single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP . Samples that test positive for the N501Y mutation in the spike gene with our assay can be sequenced to identify the lineage. Thus  our assay helps to focus surveillance efforts and decrease turnaround times.

Novel function for computing phylogenetic distance is proposed for that purpose. Proposed distance function resulted in better-fitted clusters than Jaccard and Sorensen-Dice and accurate evolutionary links were predicted for B.1.1.7 spike variants. Most B.1.1.7 spike variants were linked to their likely direct predecessors at single amino acid change  that in many cases resulted in loss of the key mutations that are associated to the higher B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. There were also cases where second mutation was introduced to compensate for the missing mutation. Unreported V90T SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein mutation was also identified  that contributes towards escaping 2–51 neutralizing antibody.

As of July 2021  the Delta variant was responsible for nearly all new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States.* The Delta variant is more transmissible than previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  1 ; however  whether it causes more severe disease in adults has been uncertain. Data from the CDC COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network  COVID-NET   a population-based surveillance system for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations  were used to examine trends in severe outcomes in adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during periods before  January-June 2021  and during  July-August 2021  Delta variant predominance. COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among all adults declined during January-June 2021  pre-Delta period   before increasing during July-August 2021  Delta period . Among sampled nonpregnant hospitalized COVID-19 patients with completed medical record abstraction and a discharge disposition during the pre-Delta period  the proportion of patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit  ICU   received invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   or died while hospitalized did not significantly change from the pre-Delta period to the Delta period. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were aged 18-49 years significantly increased  from 24.7%  95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.2%-26.3%  of all hospitalizations in the pre-Delta period  to 35.8%  95% CI = 32.1%-39.5%  p<0.01  during the Delta period. When examined by vaccination status  71.8% of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the Delta period were in unvaccinated adults. Adults aged 18-49 years accounted for 43.6%  95% CI = 39.1%-48.2%  of all hospitalizations among unvaccinated adults during the Delta period. No difference was observed in ICU admission  receipt of IMV  or in-hospital death among nonpregnant hospitalized adults between the pre-Delta and Delta periods. However  the proportion of unvaccinated adults aged 18-49 years hospitalized with COVID-19 has increased as the Delta variant has become more predominant. Lower vaccination coverage in this age group likely contributed to the increase in hospitalized patients during the Delta period. COVID-19 vaccination is critical for all eligible adults  including those aged <50 years who have relatively low vaccination rates compared with older adults.

The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates  transmissibility  and potentially mortality. To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape  we conducted infection and reinfection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters  >10 months old . Nasal wash samples from hamsters infected by a B.1.1.7 variant exhibited slightly higher viral RNA levels but lower infectious titers than those from B.1  G614  variant-infected hamsters  and the two variants induced comparable lung pathologies in hamsters. Despite a sporadic and transient low-level infection in the nasal cavity  convalescent hamsters that had recovered from a previous USA-WA1 isolate  D614  infection displayed no observable clinical signs or lung pathology following B.1.1.7 rechallenge. Altogether  our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in Syrian hamsters and that a heterologous natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 calls for evaluations of viral fitness and pathogenicity in animal models in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced transmission and the possible increases in morbidity and mortality rates. Here  we demonstrated that immunity naturally acquired through a prior infection with the first-wave variant does confer nearly complete protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in Syrian hamsters upon reexposure. Strikingly  although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to replicate to a higher level in the nose than the ancestral B.1 variant  it does not induce more severe lung pathology in hamsters.

We noticed six major differential features. First  household contacts were a large proportion of cases. Second  access to rapid antigen tests allowed prompt diagnosis and isolation. Third  clinically severe cases and mortality rates were lower than in prior waves. Fourth  the more transmissible B.1.1.7 strain was increasingly found. Fifth  vaccination benefits were seen in health care workers and nursing homes. Lastly  re-infections were more common. Before Easter  roughly 25% of the population in Madrid had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore  massive and accelerated vaccination campaigns are warranted to prevent new COVID-19 waves.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2genomicsequencesweregeneratedfrompositivesamplescollected alongwithepidemiologicalmetadata atawalk-up  rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco  California during November 22-December 1  2020 and January 10-29  2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS: A total of 12 124 tests were performed yielding 1 099 positives. From these  928 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations  defined in part by L452R  S13I  and W152C  comprised 54.4% of the total sequences from January  compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to the “California” or “West Coast” variants  B.1.427 and B.1.429  were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants  0.36 vs 0.29  RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64 . The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains  as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms  60.9% vs 64.3% . CONCLUSIONS: The increase in prevalence  relative household attack rates  and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants.

The Paediatric Asthma in Real Life  PeARL  Think Tank aspires to develop recommendations based on the best available evidence from studies in children. An overview of systematic reviews  SRs  on paediatric asthma maintenance management and an SR of treatments for acute asthma attacks in children  requiring an emergency presentation with without hospital admission will be conducted. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Standard methodology recommended by Cochrane will be followed. Maintenance pharmacotherapy of childhood asthma will be evaluated in an overview of SRs published after 2005 and including clinical trials or real-life studies. For evaluating pharmacotherapy of acute asthma attacks leading to an emergency presentation with without hospital admission  we opted to conduct de novo synthesis in the absence of adequate up-to-date published SRs. For the SR of acute asthma pharmacotherapy  we will consider eligible SRs  clinical trials or real-life studies without time restrictions. Our evidence updates will be based on broad searches of Pubmed Medline and the Cochrane Library. We will use A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews  V.2  Cochrane risk of bias 2 and REal Life EVidence AssessmeNt Tool to evaluate the methodological quality of SRs  controlled clinical trials and real-life studies  respectively. Next  we will further assess interventions for acute severe asthma attacks with positive clinical results in meta-analyses. We will include both controlled clinical trials and observational studies and will assess their quality using the previously mentioned tools. We will employ random effect models for conducting meta-analyses  and Grading of Recommendations Assessment  Development and Evaluation methodology to assess certainty in the body of evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for SRs. Our findings will be published in peer reviewed journals and will inform clinical recommendations being developed by the PeARL Think Tank.

Utilizing Oxford Nanopore technologies  we sequenced paired samples of three patients with positive RT-PCR results in a 1–2-month window period  and subsequent phylogenetics and genetic polymorphism analysis of these genomes was performed. Herein  we report  for the first time  genomic evidence of one case of reinfection in Colombia  exhibiting different SARS-CoV-2 lineage classifications between samples  B.1 and B.1.1.269 . Furthermore  we report two cases of possible viral persistence  highlighting the importance of deepening our understanding on the evolutionary intra-host traits of this virus throughout different timeframes of disease progression. These results emphasize the relevance of genomic surveillance as a tool for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics  and how this may translate effectively to future control and mitigations efforts  such as the national vaccination program.

The oropharyngeal swab from Case A tested preliminarily positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  virus using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  method after a hospital visit. In the early morning of May 21  2021  the re-collected specimens were confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 for this patient with RT-qPCR tests by Guangdong Provincial CDC and Guangzhou City CDC. Subsequently  Guangdong Province began immediately taking a series of rigorous intervention measures including social distancing  community management  and lockdown to contain this outbreak. A total of 4 cases were confirmed with COVID-19 infections between May 23 and May 26  Table 1 . These patients were transported immediately to the local designated treatment hospital for isolated treatment by ambulance after COVID-19 virus infection was confirmed. The viral ribonucleic acid  RNA  was extracted directly from 200-μL swab samples with Viral RAN DNA Mini Kit  Invitrogen  USA . High-throughput sequencing was performed for 5 COVID-19 virus samples using Illumina  USA  and MGI Tech Co.  Shenzhen  China. Nucleotide  nt  and amino acid  AA  differences between the 5 virus genome sequences from this study and the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 were analyzed using the programs BioEdit and online tool “Nextclade”  https:  clades.nextstrain.org    1 . The 5 specimens from Case A  Case B  Case C  Case D  and Case E were tentatively designated as XG5138-Case A-GZ-2021-05-21  XG5370-Case B-GZ-2021-05-23  XG5571-Case C-MM-2021-05-24  XG5647-Case D-GZ-2021-05-26  and XG5645-Case E-GZ-2021-05-26  respectively  in this study. Compared with the reference genome sequence Wuhan-Hu-1  2-3   the genome sequences coverage of these 5 strains were 99.89%  99.85%  99.86%  99.86%  and 99.87%  respectively. Based on the “Pango lineages” rule  the 5 virus strains from this study were assigned to delta  B.1.617.2   which was also known as variant of concern  VOC  Delta  Figure 1   4-6 . Compared with the reference genome sequence Wuhan-Hu-1  5 strains shared 35 nucleotide variation sites  G210T  C241T  C1191T  C1267T  C3037T  C5184T  T6023C  C9598T  C9891T  T11418C  T12946C  C14408T  G15451A  C16466T  C18176T  A20262G  A21137G  C21618G  G21987A  T22917G  C22995A  A23403G  C23604G  G24410A  G25088T  C25469T  A25562G  T26767C  T27638C  C27739T  C27752T  A28461G  G28881T  G29402T  and G29742T  and 7 deletion mutations  22029–22035  28248–28254  and 28274 . Except for the mutations above  another variation site  C27092T  was observed in genome of the strain XG5571-Case C-MM-2021-05-24  XG5647-Case D-GZ-2021-05-26  and XG5645-Case E-GZ-2021-05-26. XG5370-Case B-GZ-2021-05-23 had a unique variation site  T21673C   but not the C27092T variation. By comparing deduced amino acid sequences  the 5 strains displayed 29 AA variation sites  M:I82T;N:D63G  R203M  D377Y;ORF1a:P309L  P1640L  Y1920H  A3209V  V3718A;ORF1b:P314L  G662S  P1000L  P1570L  K2557R;ORF3a:S26L  Q57R;ORF7a:V82A  L116F  T120I;ORF9b:T60A;S:T19R  G142D  R158G  L452R  T478K  D614G  P681R  D950N  and V1176F  and 4 deletion mutations  ORF8:D119del  F120del;S:F156del  and R157del . The delta  B.1.617.2  was first identified in India in October 2020 and its spike protein had 9–10 characteristic mutations: T19R   G142D   156del  157del  R158G  L452R  T478K  D614G  P681R  and D950N  4-5 7 . According to the current data of the World Health Organization  WHO   the delta  B.1.617.2  spread rapidly to 74 countries  areas  or territories  December 2019–June 8  2021   5 . The epidemiological investigation showed that Case A was the index case and Case B  husband  was a close contact of Case A. Furthermore  Case C and Case E were at high risk of exposure due to Case A’ s activities  Case C as a waiter served Case A in a restaurant  and Case E went to same restaurant for dinner at the same time . Lastly  Case D was the grandson of Case E and was therefore a close contact. The whole gene sequencing results showed that Case C  Case D  and Case E added a common mutation site  C27092T  based on the sequence of Case A  and Case B possessed a new mutation site  T21673C  compared with Case A’s sequence. This Guangzhou outbreak is the first local transmission caused by delta  B.1.617.2  in China. The transmissibility and pathogenicity of these mutant variants urgently need more attention.

Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant on the Spectrum of Pediatric COVID-19 Disease in Arkansas,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.1641,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.1641,,pmc:PMC8644082,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,LB10. Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant on the Spectrum of Pediatric COVID-19 Disease in Arkansas,BACKGROUND: Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally thought to be asymptomatic or result in mild COVID-19 disease  with a paucity of severe outcomes. However  SARS-CoV-2 variants  notably B.1.617.2  WHO Delta   have changed the clinical landscape of COVID-19 in the United States. Delta became the dominant variant in Arkansas  AR  the 1 st  week of July 2021. Schools contributed to pediatric infections during the January 2021 surge in COVID-19 infections even with physical mitigation measures  PMM  that were removed in March 2021. We present preliminary data suggesting a shift in the clinical presentation of children with Delta variant infection. [Image: see text] METHODS: Pediatric  ages ≤ 18 years  case records for the 3 months representing key inflection points of the COVID-19 Pandemic in AR were reviewed. Outcomes  hospitalizations  ICU admission  mechanical ventilation  death  were recorded by the Arkansas Department of Health  ADH  in a statewide database. Fisher’s Exact Test was used with p-values < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. RESULTS: During July 2020  3 268 pediatric cases were reported to ADH with 55 hospitalizations  6 ICU admissions  2 mechanical ventilations  and no deaths. A second peak in January 2021 included 11 735 pediatric cases  a 259.1% increase. Increases were also seen in hospitalizations  n=74   ICU admissions  n= 11   and mechanical ventilations  n=2 . No deaths reported. The beginning of an exponential growth in cases during July 2021  before the opening of schools  included 8 031 pediatric cases. Despite 31.6% fewer cases than the previous peak  hospitalizations increased 41.9%  n=105   p < 0.0001  and included increases in ICU and ventilator use of 68.6%  n=18   p 0.0016  and 300%  n=8   p 0.0034   respectively. One pediatric death was reported.  Tbl 1  CONCLUSION: In the absence of PMM and despite the summer closure of schools  pediatric COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes increased significantly. Initial analysis of the AR July 2021 Delta variant surge indicates a statistically significant increase in pediatric COVID-19 disease and severity as indicated by a proportional increase in hospitalizations  ICU  and ventilator use. Further studies are warranted to better define Delta related childhood disease. Our findings also have implications for school PMM efforts. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures

An orally bioavailable remdesivir analog may boost therapeutic benefit by facilitating early administration to non-hospitalized patients. This study characterizes the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of GS-621763  an oral prodrug of remdesivir parent nucleoside GS-441524. Both GS-621763 and GS-441524 inhibit SARS-CoV-2  including variants of concern  VOC  in cell culture and human airway epithelium organoids. Oral GS-621763 is efficiently converted to plasma metabolite GS-441524  and in lungs to the triphosphate metabolite identical to that generated by remdesivir  demonstrating a consistent mechanism of activity. Twice-daily oral administration of 10 mg kg GS-621763 reduces SARS-CoV-2 burden to near-undetectable levels in ferrets. When dosed therapeutically against VOC P.1 gamma γ  oral GS-621763 blocks virus replication and prevents transmission to untreated contact animals. These results demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of a much-needed orally bioavailable analog of remdesivir in a relevant animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Elucidating the evolutionary and epidemiologic dynamics among novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is essential for understanding the trajectory of the coronavirus disease pandemic. We describe the interplay between B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.526  Iota  variants in New York State  USA  during December 2020–April 2021 through phylogeographic analyses  space-time scan statistics  and cartographic visualization. Our results indicate that B.1.526 probably evolved in New York City  where it was displaced as the dominant lineage by B.1.1.7 months after its initial appearance. In contrast  B.1.1.7 became dominant earlier in regions with fewer B.1.526 infections. These results suggest that B.1.526 might have delayed the initial spread of B.1.1.7 in New York City. Our combined spatiotemporal methodologies can help disentangle the complexities of shifting SARS-CoV-2 variant landscapes.

To identify protective immunity  optimization of the chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing test  CRNT  is critical. Whether commercial antibody tests have comparable accuracy is unknown. Serum samples were obtained from COVID-19 patients  n = 74   SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative  n = 179   and suspected healthy individuals  n = 229  before SARS-CoV-2 variants had been detected locally. The convalescent phase was defined as the period after day 10 from disease onset or the episode of close contact. The CRNT using pseudotyped viruses displaying the wild-type  WT  spike protein and a commercial anti-receptor-binding domain  RBD  antibody test were assayed. Serology for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants was also assayed. Both tests concurred for symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the convalescent phase. They clearly differentiated between patients and suspected healthy individuals  sensitivity: 95.8% and 100%  respectively; specificity: 99.1% and 100%  respectively . Anti-RBD antibody test results correlated with neutralizing titers  r = 0.31  95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22–0.38 . Compared with the WT  lower CRNT values were observed for the variants. Of the samples with ≥100 U mL by the anti-RBD antibody test  77.8% and 88.9% showed ≥50% neutralization against the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 variants  respectively. Exceeding 100 U mL in the anti-RBD antibody test was associated with neutralization of variants  P < 0.01 . The CRNT and commercial anti-RBD antibody test effectively classified convalescent COVID-19 patients. Strong positive results with the anti-RBD antibody test can reflect neutralizing activity against emerging variants. IMPORTANCE This study provides a diagnostic evidence of test validity  which can lead to vaccine efficacy and proof of recovery after COVID-19. It is not easy to know neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical laboratory because of technical and biohazard issues. The correlation of the quantitative anti-receptor-binding domain antibody test  which is widely available  with neutralizing test indicates that we can know indirectly the state of acquisition of functional immunity against wild and variant-type viruses in the clinical laboratory.

Syncytia form when SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein expressed on the surface of infected cells interacts with the ACE2 receptor on neighboring cells. The syncytia forming potential of spike variant proteins remain poorly characterized. Here  we first assessed Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Beta  B.1.351  spread and fusion in cell cultures  compared with the ancestral D614G strain. Alpha and Beta replicated similarly to D614G strain in Vero  Caco‐2  Calu‐3  and primary airway cells. However  Alpha and Beta formed larger and more numerous syncytia. Variant spike proteins displayed higher ACE2 affinity compared with D614G. Alpha  Beta  and D614G fusion was similarly inhibited by interferon‐induced transmembrane proteins  IFITMs . Individual mutations present in Alpha and Beta spikes modified fusogenicity  binding to ACE2 or recognition by monoclonal antibodies. We further show that Delta spike also triggers faster fusion relative to D614G. Thus  SARS‐CoV‐2 emerging variants display enhanced syncytia formation.

The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS CoV-2 is reported to cause higher transmission. The study investigates the replication cycle and transcriptional pattern of the B.1.1.7 to hypothesis the possible role of different genes in viral replication. It was observed that the B.1.1.7 variant required a longer maturation time. The transcriptional response demonstrated higher expression of ORF6 and ORF8 compared to nucleocapsid transcript till the eclipse period which might influence higher viral replication. The number of infectious viruses titer is higher in the B.1.1.7  despite a lesser copy number than B.1  indicating higher transmissibility. The experimental evidence published linked ORF6 and ORF8 to play important role in replication and we also observed their higher expression. This leads us to hypothesis the possible role of ORF6 and ORF8 in B.1.1.7 higher replication which causes higher transmission.

Although having submitted a large number of sequences since September 2020  however  these submitted data lack advanced analyses. Therefore  in this study  we analyze the variant distribution  hotspot mutation  and its impact on protein structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 from the collected samples from WJHL. As many as one hundred sixty-three SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted by West Java Health Laboratory  WJHL   with collection dates between September 2020 and June 2021  were retrieved from GISAID. Subsequently  the frequency and distribution of non-synonymous mutations across different cities and regencies from these samples were analyzed. The effect of the most prevalent mutations from dominant variants on the stability of their corresponding proteins was examined. The samples mostly consisted of people of working-age  and were distributed between female and male equally. All of the sample sequences showed varying levels of diversity  especially samples from West Bandung which carried the highest diversity. Dominant variants are the VOC B.1.617.2  Delta  variant  B.1.466.2 variant  and B.1.470 variant. The genomic regions with the highest number of mutations are the spike  NSP3  nucleocapsid  NSP12  and ORF3a protein. Mutation analysis showed that mutations in structural protein might increase the stability of the protein. Oppositely  mutations in non-structural protein might lead to a decrease in protein stability. However  further research to study the impact of mutations on the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are required.

Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK–B.1.1.7  South Africa–B.1.351 and Brazil–P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein which facilitates viral cell entry via the Angiotensin converting enzyme-2  ACE2  receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant.

We performed high-throughput sequencing on nine samples that were found to have a high concentration of viral RNA. We also assessed the potential impact that long-distance transport of samples to testing centres may have on sequencing results. Here  two samples that were similar in terms of viral RNA concentration but were transported from sites that are over 400 km apart were analyzed. All sequences were compared to previous sequences from Ghana and representative sequences from regions where our patients had previously travelled. Three complete genome sequences and another nearly complete genome sequence with 95.6% coverage were obtained. Sequences with coverage in excess of 80% were found to belong to three lineages  namely A  B.1 and B.2. Our sequences clustered in two different clades  with the majority falling within a clade composed of sequences from sub-Saharan Africa. Less RNA fragmentation was seen in sample KATH23  which was collected 9 km from the testing site  than in sample TTH6  which was collected and transported over a distance of 400 km to the testing site. The clustering of several sequences from sub-Saharan Africa suggests regional circulation of the viruses in the subregion. Importantly  there may be a need to decentralize testing sites and build more capacity across Africa to boost the sequencing output of the subregion.

This apparent paradox was particularly observed in the northern region of Brazil  in the state of Amazonas. We hypothesized that the emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  mutations  leading to more transmissible and pathogenic variants  could explain the lack of further reductions in COVID-19 new cases and related deaths in some regions. Our objective is to determine if social isolation is associated with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants  particularly the P.1 lineage and E484K mutants  in Brazil and in the state of Amazonas. Materials and methods We assessed the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in Brazil available on the GISAID  Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data  database collected between June 1  2020  and January 31  2021. Data regarding demographics  lineage  and prevalence of P.1 lineage and E484K mutations were obtained. Social isolation was measured using the Social Isolation Index  SII   which quantifies the percentage of individuals that stayed within a distance of 450 meters from their homes on a given day  between February 1  2020  and January 24  2021. The number of daily COVID-19 deaths was obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health  OpenDataSUS  2021  between March 12  2020  and January 10  2021. SII was correlated with the prevalence P.1 lineage and E484K mutations in the eight following weeks. All univariate associations were estimated using the Spearman Correlation Index. 3D surfaces were employed to reflect the relationship between time  social isolation  and prevalence of genomic variants simultaneously. Results A total of 773 and 77 samples were obtained in Brazil and in the Amazonas state  respectively. In the state of Amazonas  SII on a given week was positively  significantly  and moderately or strongly  r > 0.6  correlated with the prevalence of both P.1 lineage and other E484K variants in the six following weeks after the SII on a given week. Conversely  in overall Brazil  correlations between SII and P.1 lineage and E484K variants were weaker and shorter  or negative  respectively. When SII was below 40%  P.1 lineage or E484K variants were not detected in the following weeks. When SII was above 40%  apparently exponential positive correlations between SII and prevalence of both P.1 lineage and E484K variants were observed. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that SII above 40% is associated with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 E484K variants and P.1 lineage in the state of Amazonas  which was not observed in overall Brazil.

METHODS: We compare the immunogenicity and durability of these two vaccines among fully vaccinated Hong Kong people. FINDINGS: Standard BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccinations were tolerated and induced neutralizing antibody  NAb   100% and 85.7%  and spike-specific CD4 T cell responses  96.7% and 82.1%   respectively. The geometric mean NAb IC 50  and median frequencies of reactive CD4 subsets were consistently lower among CoronaVac-vaccinees than BNT162b2-vaccinees. CoronaVac did not induce measurable levels of nucleocapsid protein-specific IFN-γ +  CD4 +  T or IFN-γ +  CD8 +  T cells compared with unvaccinated. Against VOCs  NAb response rates and geometric mean IC 50  titers against B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.1.529  Omicron  were significantly lower for CoronaVac  50%  23.2 and 7.1%  <20  than BNT162b2  94.1%  131 and 58.8%  35.0   respectively. Three months after vaccinations  NAbs to VOCs dropped near to detection limit  along with waning memory T cell responses  mainly among CoronaVac-vaccinees. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that vaccinees especially CoronaVac-vaccinees with significantly reduced NAbs may probably face higher risk to pandemic VOCs breakthrough infection.

Here we analyzed a prospective cohort of 121 recovered COVID-19 patients from Xiangyang  China at 1-year after diagnosis. Among them  chemiluminescence immunoassay-based screening showed 99%  95% CI  98–100%  seroprevalence 10–12 months after infection  comparing to 0.8%  95% CI  0.7–0.9%  in the general population. Total anti-receptor-binding domain  RBD  antibodies remained stable since discharge  while anti-RBD IgG and neutralization levels decreased over time. A predictive model estimates 17%  95% CI  11–24%  and 87%  95% CI  80–92%  participants were still 50% protected against detectable and severe re-infection of WT SARS-CoV-2  respectively  while neutralization levels against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were significantly reduced. All non-severe patients showed normal chest CT and 21% reported COVID-19-related symptoms. In contrast  53% severe patients had abnormal chest CT  decreased pulmonary function or cardiac involvement and 79% were still symptomatic. Our findings suggest long-lasting immune protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection  while also highlight the risk of immune evasive variants and long-term consequences for COVID-19 survivors.

Over a period of 7 weeks from early February through late March 2021  wastewater originating from the residence hall was collected as grab samples 3 times per week. During this time  there was no detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  in the residence hall wastewater stream. Aiming to obtain a sample more representative of the residence hall community  a decision was made to use passive samplers beginning in late March onwards. Adopting a Moore swab approach  SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater samples just 2 days after passive samplers were deployed. These samples also tested positive for the B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant of concern  VOC  using RT-qPCR. The positive result triggered a public health case-finding response  including a mobile testing unit deployed to the residence hall the following day  with testing of nearly 200 students and staff  which identified two laboratory-confirmed cases of Alpha variant COVID-19. These individuals were relocated to a separate quarantine facility  averting an outbreak on campus. Aggregating wastewater and clinical data  the campus wastewater surveillance program has yielded the first estimates of fecal shedding rates of the Alpha VOC of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals from a nonclinical setting. IMPORTANCE Among early adopters of wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 have been colleges and universities throughout North America  many of whom are using this approach to monitor congregate living facilities for early evidence of COVID-19 infection as an integral component of campus screening programs. Yet  while there have been numerous examples where wastewater monitoring on a university campus has detected evidence for infection among community members  there are few examples where this monitoring triggered a public health response that may have averted an actual outbreak. This report details a wastewater-testing program targeting a residence hall on a university campus during spring 2021  when there was mounting concern globally over the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  reported to be more transmissible than the wild-type Wuhan strain. In this communication  we present a clear example of how wastewater monitoring resulted in actionable responses by university administration and public health  which averted an outbreak of COVID-19 on a university campus.

The N501Y  69-70del  K417N  and E484K SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented among the most relevant due to their potential pathogenic biological effects. This study aimed to design  validate  and propose a fast real-time RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 mutations with possible clinical and epidemiological relevance in the Mexican population. METHODS: Targeting spike  S  gene mutations of SARS-CoV-2  N501Y  69-70del  K417N  and E484K   specific primers  and probes for three specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR  RT-qPCR  assays were designed  and validated using Sanger sequencing. These assays were applied in clinical samples of 1060 COVID-19 patients from Jalisco Mexico. RESULTS: In silico analyzes showed high specificity of the three assays. Amplicons of samples were confirmed through sequencing. The screening of samples of COVID-19 patients allowed the identification of the E484K mutation in nine individuals and the identification of P.2 Brazilian variant in Mexico. CONCLUSION: This work provides low-cost RT-qPCR assays for rapid screening and molecular surveillance of mutations with potential clinical impact. This strategy allowed the detection of E484K mutation and P.2 variant for the first time in samples from the Mexican population.

SARS-CoV-2 is also called coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  since SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Several studies already suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant would be the fastest transmissible variant compared to the previous 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  interest  and alert. Few clinical studies reported the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant but there is insufficient time to perform actual experiments to prove it  since the spread is so fast. We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant  which revealed a very high rate of mutation at amino acid residues that interact with angiostatin-converting enzyme 2. The mutation rate of COVID-19 is faster than what we prepared vaccine program  antibody therapy  lockdown  and quarantine against COVID-19 so far. Thus  it is necessary to find better strategies to overcome the current crisis of COVID-19 pandemic.

The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented  but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains  as measured by risk of hospitalization  intensive care unit  ICU  admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs  with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27  2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization  ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age  sex  time  vaccination status  comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains  the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52%  95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%  for hospitalization  89%  95% CI 67%–117%  for ICU admission and 51%  95% CI 30%–78%  for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108%  95% CI 78%–140%  for hospitalization  235%  95% CI 160%–331%  for ICU admission and 133%  95% CI 54%–231%  for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger  and more deadly  pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.

Using the nucleic acid sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 nonvariant and a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 variant-carrying plasmid  a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry  MALDI-TOF MS  method based on the single-base mass probe extension of multiplex PCR amplification products was established to detect 9 mutation types in 7 mutated sites  HV6970del  N501Y  K417N  P681H  D614G  E484K  L452R  E484Q  and P681R  in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Twenty-one respiratory tract pathogens  9 bacteria and 12 respiratory viruses  and nucleic acid samples from non-COVID-19 patients were selected for specific validation. Twenty samples from COVID-19 patients were used to verify the accuracy of this method. The 9 mutation types could be detected simultaneously by triple PCR amplification coupled with MALDI-TOF MS. SARS-CoV-2 and six variants  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   B.1.429  Epsilon   B.1.526  Iota   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta   could be identified. The detection limit for all 9 sites was 1.5 × 10 3  copies. The specificity of this method was 100%  and the accuracy of real-time PCR cycle threshold  C T   values less than 27 among positive samples was 100%. This method is open and extensible  and can be used in a high-throughput manner  easily allowing the addition of new mutation sites as needed to identify and track new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge. mPCR-MS minisequencing provides a new detection option with practical application value for SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection. IMPORTANCE The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is the key factor in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. An all-in-one SARS-CoV-2 variant identification method based on a multiplex PCR-mass spectrometry minisequencing system was developed in this study. Six SARS-CoV-2 variants  Alpha  Beta  Epsilon  Iota  Gamma  and Delta  can be identified simultaneously. This method can not only achieve the multisite simultaneous detection that cannot be realized by PCR coupled with first-generation sequencing technology and quantitative PCR  qPCR  technology but also avoid the shortcomings of time-consuming  high-cost  and high technical requirements of whole-genome sequencing technology. As a simple screening assay for monitoring the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and variants  mPCR-MS minisequencing is expected to play an important role in the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a supplementary technology.

In the present study  spike  S  protein of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  circulating in Bangladesh was genetically investigated to elucidate diversity of mutations and their prevalence. Nucleotide sequence of S protein gene was determined for 15 SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from 8 divisions in Bangladesh  and analyzed for mutations comparing with that of reference strain  hCoV-19 Wuhan WIV04 2019 . All the SARS-CoV-2 S genes were assigned to B.1 lineage in G clade  and individual S proteins had 1-25 mutations causing amino acid substitution deletion. Total 133 mutations were detected in 15 samples  with G614D being present in all the samples  while 53 novel mutations as of Jan. 2021 were detected. On receptor-binding domain  21 substitutions including ten novel mutations were identified. Other novel mutations were located on N-terminal domain  S1 subunit  and dispersed sites in S2 subunit  including two substitutions that remove potential N-glycosylation sites. P681R substitution adjacent to furin cleavage site was detected in one sample. All the mutations detected were located on positions that are functionally linked to host transition  antigenic drift  host surface receptor binding or antibody recognition sites  and viral oligomerization interfaces  which presumably related to viral transmission and pathogenic capacity.

We develop the software tool  Variant Database  VDB   for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB  we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage  now designated as B.1.526  are L5F  T95I  D253G  E484K or S477N  D614G  and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants  like B.1.1.7  the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma  supporting the public health relevance of this lineage.

The two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike  S  protein  designated as lineages P.1 and P.2  evolved from lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern  VOC  because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein  including K417T  E484K  N501Y   while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest  VOI . On the other hand  epidemiologically relevant B.1.1.33 deriving lineages have not been described so far. Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed four non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations  NSP3:A1711V  NSP6:F36L  S:E484K  and NS7b:E33A  and was designated as lineage N.9. The VOI N.9 probably emerged in August 2020 and has spread across different Brazilian states from the Southeast  South  North  and Northeast regions.

The Abbott Global Surveillance program monitors severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  variants and their impact on diagnostic test performance. OBJECTIVES: : To evaluate the capacity of Abbott molecular  antigen  and serologic assays to detect circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  including all current variants of concern  VOC : B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma  and B.1.617.2  delta . STUDY DESIGN: : Dilutions of variant virus cultures  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.429  B.1.526.1  B.1.526.2  B.1.617.1  B.1.617.2  P.1  R.1 and control isolate WA1  and a panel of N = 248 clinical samples from patients with sequence confirmed variant infections  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.427  B.1.429  B.1.526  B.1.526.1  B.1.526.2  P.1  P.2  R.1  were evaluated on at least one assay: Abbott ID NOW COVID-19  m2000 RealTime SARS-CoV-2  Alinity m SARS-CoV-2  and Alinity m Resp-4-Plex molecular assays; the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device; and the ARCHITECT Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and AdviseDx IgM assays  Panbio COVID-19 IgG assay  and ARCHITECT Alinity i AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay. RESULTS: : Consistent with in silico predictions  each molecular and antigen assay detected VOC virus cultures with equivalent sensitivity to the WA1 control strain. Notably  100% of all tested variant patient specimens were detected by molecular assays  N = 197 m2000  N = 88 Alinity m  N = 99 ID NOW   and lateral flow assays had a sensitivity of >94% for specimens with genome equivalents  GE  per device above 4 log  85 88  Panbio; 54 57 Binax . Furthermore  Abbott antibody assays detected IgG and IgM in 94–100% of sera from immune competent B.1.1.7 patients 15–26 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: : These data confirm variant detection for 11 SARS-CoV-2 assays  which is consistent with each assay target region being highly conserved. Importantly  alpha  beta  gamma  and delta VOCs were detected by molecular and antigen assays  indicating that these tests may be suitable for widescale use where VOCs predominate.

Following this  the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  then became the predominant variant. The UK COVID-19 vaccination programme started on 8th December 2020. Prior to the Delta variant  most vaccine effectiveness studies focused on the alpha variant. We therefore aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  Oxford-AstraZeneca  vaccines in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic infection with respect to the Delta variant in a UK setting. METHODS: We used anonymised public health record data linked to infection data  PCR  using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. We then constructed an SIR epidemic model to explain SARS-CoV-2 infection data across the Cheshire and Merseyside region of the UK. Vaccines were assumed to be effective after 21 days for 1 dose and 14 days for 2 doses. RESULTS: We determined that the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in reducing susceptibility to infection is 39%  95% credible interval [34  43]  and 64%  95% credible interval [61  67]  for a single dose and a double dose respectively. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine  the effectiveness is 20%  95% credible interval [10  28]  and 84%  95% credible interval [82  86]  for a single-dose and a double dose respectively. CONCLUSION: Vaccine effectiveness for reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection shows noticeable improvement after receiving two doses of either vaccine. Findings also suggest that a full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech provides the optimal protection against infection with the Delta variant. This reinforces the need to complete the full course programme to maximise individual protection and reduce transmission.

They all contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein  compared to the original Wuhan sequence  which is of great concern  because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion  Taraxacum officinale  to block protein–protein interaction of SARS-COV-2 spike to the human ACE2 receptor. This could be shown for the wild type and mutant forms  D614G  N501Y  and a mix of K417N  E484K  and N501Y  in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High-molecular-weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike D614 and spike Delta  B.1.617.2  variant pseudotyped lentivirus particles was efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus  the in vitro results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of a non-invasive  oral post-exposure prophylaxis.

Here  we evaluated in mice the protective activity of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine against B.1.1.529 before or after boosting with preclinical mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529  an Omicron-matched vaccine. Whereas two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine induced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies against historical WA1 2020 strains  levels were lower against B.1.1.529 and associated with infection and inflammation in the lung. A primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273.529 potently neutralized B.1.1.529 but showed limited inhibition of historical or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. However  boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 vaccines increased serum neutralizing titers and protection against B.1.1.529 infection. Nonetheless  the levels of inhibitory antibodies were higher  and viral burden and cytokines in the lung were slightly lower in mice given the Omicron-matched mRNA booster. Thus  in mice  boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 enhances protection against B.1.1.529 infection with limited differences in efficacy measured.

First  most of the predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes showed proper binding with HLA-A2  while epitopes from B.1.1.7 had lower binding capability than those from the ancestral strain. In addition  these peptides could effectively induced the activation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. Our results further showed that at least two site mutations in B.1.1.7 resulted in a decrease in CD8+ T cell activation and a possible immune evasion  namely A1708D mutation in ORF1ab1707-1716 and I2230T mutation in ORF1ab2230-2238. Our current analysis provides information that contributes to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by infection of mutated strains or vaccination.

Here  3 receptor binding domain  RBD  specific monoclonal antibodies  mAbs   58G6  510A5 and 13G9  with high neutralizing potency blocking authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus display remarkable efficacy against authentic B.1.351 virus. Surprisingly  structural analysis has revealed that 58G6 and 13G9 both recognize the steric region S 470–495  on the RBD  overlapping the E484K mutation presented in B.1.351. Also  58G6 directly binds to another region S 450–458  in the RBD.

In the current study  we used the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model to assess reinfection with homologous WA1 and heterologous B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.351  beta  SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. Upon primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 WA1  hamsters rapidly developed a strong and long-lasting humoral immune response. Following reinfection with homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants  this immune response protected hamsters from clinical disease  virus replication in the lower respiratory tract and acute lung pathology. However  reinfection led to SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract with the potential for virus shedding. Our findings indicate that reinfection results in restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication despite substantial levels of humoral immunity  denoting the potential for transmission through reinfected asymptomatic individuals.

About 33% were associated with a Tablighi Jamaat religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 3  2020  which drove community transmission during Malaysia’s second wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to better understand the molecular epidemiology and spread. We obtained 58 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from patients in Kuala Lumpur and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 57 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Nine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages  A  B  B.1  B.1.1  B.1.1.1  B.1.36  B.2  B.3 and B.6  were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the Tablighi mass gathering and became predominant  65.2%  despite being relatively rare  1.4%  globally. Direct epidemiological links between lineage B.6 viruses and the mass gathering were identified. Increases in reported total cases  Tablighi-associated cases  and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly travel-associated and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries  India and Australia  linked to participants returning from this event. Over 95% of global B.6 sequences originated from Asia Pacific. We also report a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 47.3% of global B.6 sequences which was associated with reduced sensitivity using a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay. Lineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the Asia-Pacific. Mass gatherings can be significant causes of local and global spread of COVID-19. Shared genomic surveillance can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains to aid prevention and control  and to monitor diagnostic molecular assays.

Single-amplicon  Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR with Tiled Probes to Detect SARS-CoV-2 spike Mutations Associated with Variants of Concern,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.148,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.148,,pmc:PMC8644603,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,148. Single-amplicon  Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR with Tiled Probes to Detect SARS-CoV-2 spike Mutations Associated with Variants of Concern,BACKGROUND: Detection and surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants is of great public health importance. Broadly accessible and inexpensive assays are needed to enhance variant surveillance and detection globally. We developed and validated a single-reaction multiplex real-time RT-PCR  the Spike SNP assay  to detect specific mutations associated with variants of concern  VOC . METHODS: A single primer pair was designed to amplify a 348 bp region of spike. Probes were initially designed with locked nucleic acids  LNAs  to increase probe melting temperature  shorten probe length  and specifically detect 417K  E484K  and N501Y  Figure . The assay was optimized and evaluated using characterized variant sample pools. Clinical evaluation was performed on a convenience set of residual nasopharyngeal swabs  and variant calls were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing in a subset of samples. Following the initial evaluation  unmodified probes  without LNAs  were designed to detect L452R  L452Q  and E484Q. Figure. Spike SNP distinguishes mutations occurring in different lineages  A-C . [Image: see text] Representative results of variant detection a single Spike SNP run are shown for mutations in the codons for 4177K  A  and mutations that encode 484K  B  and 501Y  C . Curves show dilutions of the following variants: blue  BEI 52286  wild type ; pink B.1.1.7; purple  B1.525; and green  P.1. Variant pools were used for B.1.17  B.1.525  and P.1 strains. Curves are displayed for a given dilution in each channel and result interpretation is shown  D . RESULTS: The lower limit of 95% detection was 2.46 to 2.48 log 10  GE mL for the three targets  ~1-2 GE reaction . Among 253 nasopharyngeal swabs with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA  the Spike SNP assay was positive in 238  94.1%   including all samples with Ct values < 30  220 220  for the N2 target and 18 33 samples with N2 Ct values ≥ 30. Results were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing in 50 50 samples  100% . Subsequent addition of the 452R probe did not affect performance for the original targets  and probes for 452Q and 484Q performed similarly to LNA-modified probes. CONCLUSION: The Spike SNP assay provides fast  inexpensive and sensitive detection of specific mutations associated with SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  and the assay can be quickly modified to detect new mutations in the receptor binding domain. Similar analytical performance of LNA-modified and unmodified probes presents options for future assay customization that balance the shorter probe length  LNAs  and increased accessibility  unmodified . The Spike SNP assay  if implemented across laboratories offering SARS-CoV-2 testing  could greatly increase capacity for variant detection and surveillance globally. DISCLOSURES: Colleen S.

B.1.135 and P.1 lineages have another mutation  E484K. Here  we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor  ACE2  and neutralizing antibody  B38  recognition. The N501Y RBD mutant binds to ACE2 with higher affinity due to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The higher binding affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of additional hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interactions with ACE2. Both the mutants bind to the B38 antibody with reduced affinity due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions. The insights obtained from the study are crucial to interpret the increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization efficacy of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV2 VOCs.

Here  employing hundreds of replicate sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations  we statistically compare atom motions of ACE2 and CD26 target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain  RBD  of the S spike glycoprotein. In all strains  we demonstrate a universally conserved functional binding signature of the viral RBD with the N-terminal helices of ACE2. We also identify a second more dynamically transient interaction of the viral N501 with the previously confirmed ACE2 K353 and two nearby novel sites  Q325 and the AAQPFLL 386–92 motif. We propose a model of the functional evolution of SARS-type zoonotic spillovers involving both  A  a conserved binding interaction with the N-terminal helices of ACE2 that is preadapted from viral interaction of the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus progenitor strain HKU4 with the SAMLI 291–5 motif in protein CD26 and  B  a more promiscuous and likely more evolvable interaction between viral N501 and the above-mentioned multiple regions of ACE2 that is preadapted from the bat viral interaction at the CD26 SS 333–4 motif. Our recent analysis of the highly transmissible N501Y lineage B.1.1.7 mutation in SARS-CoV-2 also supports this model  identifying a less promiscuous Y501 interaction with ACE2 that favors more stable functional binding with the K353 site alone.

Recently  B.1.1.7 Alpha   B1.351 Beta   and B.1.617.2 Delta  strains  which appear to have increased transmissibility  were detected. These strains accounting for the high proportion of newly diagnosed cases spread rapidly over the world. Particularly  the Delta variant has been reported to account for a vast majority of the infections in several countries over the last few weeks. The application of biosensors in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high demand for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping  it is urgent to develop reliable and efficient systems based on integrated multiple biosensor technology for rapid detection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutations simultaneously. This is important not only for the detection and analysis of the current but also for future mutations. Novel biosensors combined with other technologies can be used for the reliable and effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.

Currently  whole-genome sequencing is commonly used for detecting VOCs  but this is limited by the high costs of reagents and sophisticated sequencers. In this study  common mutations in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were identified by analyzing more than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from public data. Among them  mutations C1709A  a change of C to A at position 1709  and C56G  respectively  were found in more than 99% of the genomes of Alpha and Delta variants and were specific to them. Then  a method using the amplification refractory mutation system combined with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR  ARMS-RT-qPCR  based on the two mutations was developed for identifying both VOCs. The assay can detect as little as 1 copy μL of the VOCs  and the results for identifying Alpha and Delta variants in clinical samples by the ARMS-RT-qPCR assay showed 100% agreement with the results using sequencing-based methods. The whole assay can be completed in 2.5 h using commercial fluorescent PCR instruments. Therefore  the ARMS-RT-qPCR assay could be used for screening the two highly concerning variants Alpha and Delta by normal PCR laboratories in airports and in hospitals and other health-related organizations. Additionally  based on the unique mutations identified by the genomic analysis  similar molecular assays can be developed for rapid identification of other VOCs. IMPORTANCE The current stage of the pandemic  led by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs   underscores the necessity to develop a cost-effective and rapid molecular diagnosis assay to differentiate the VOCs. In this study  over 1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of high quality from GISAID were analyzed and a network of the common mutations of the lineages was constructed. The conserved unique mutations specific for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were found. Then  ARMS-RT-qPCR assays based on the two unique mutations of the Alpha and Delta variants were developed for the detection of the two VOCs. Application of the assay in clinical samples demonstrated that the current method is a convenient  cost-effective  and rapid way to screen the target SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

In particular  the focus is on mutations of Spike protein  which binds human ACE2 protein enabling SARS-CoV2 entry and infection. Here we present a rapid experimental method leveraging the speed and flexibility of Mircoscale Thermopheresis  MST  to characterize the interaction between Spike Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  and human ACE2 protein. The B.1.351 variant harboring three mutations   E484K  N501Y  and K417N  binds the ACE2 at nearly five-fold greater affinity than the original SARS-COV-2 RBD. We also find that the B.1.1.7 variant  binds two-fold more tightly to ACE2 than the SARS-COV-2 RBD.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  predominantly against the delta  B.1.617.2  variant  in addition to the cellular immune response to vaccination. METHODS: We did a test-negative  case-control study at two medical research centres in Faridabad  India. All individuals who had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 1  2021  and May 31  2021  were included as cases and individuals who had a negative RT-PCR test were included as controls after matching with cases on calendar week of RT-PCR test. The primary outcome was effectiveness of complete vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary outcomes were effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectiveness of a single dose and complete vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease among infected individuals. Additionally  we tested in-vitro live-virus neutralisation and T-cell immune responses to the spike protein of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs among healthy  anti-nucleocapsid antibody negative  recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. FINDINGS: Of 2379 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  85  3·6%  were fully vaccinated compared with 168  8·5%  of 1981 controls  adjusted OR [aOR] 0·37 [95% CI 0·28–0·48]   giving a vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 63·1%  95% CI 51·5–72·1 . 157  6·4%  of 2451 of cases and 181  9·1%  of 1994  controls had received a single dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  aOR 0·54 [95% CI 0·42–0·68]   thus vaccine effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 46·2%  95% CI 31·6–57·7 . One of 84 cases with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was fully vaccinated compared with 84 of 2295 cases with mild COVID-19  aOR 0·19 [95% CI 0·01–0·90]   giving a vaccine effectiveness of complete vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease of 81·5%  95% CI 9·9–99·0 . The effectiveness of a single dose against moderate-to-severe disease was 79·2%  95% CI 46·1–94·0 ; four of 87 individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 had received a single dose compared with 153 of 2364 participants with mild disease  aOR 0·20 [95% CI 0·06–0·54] . Among 49 healthy  fully vaccinated individuals  neutralising antibody responses were lower against the alpha  B.1.1.7; geometric mean titre 244·7 [95% CI 151·8–394·4]   beta  B.1.351; 97·6 [61·2–155·8]   kappa  B.1.617.1; 112·8 [72·7–175·0]   and delta  88·4 [61·2–127·8]  variants than against wild-type SARS-CoV-2  599·4 [376·9–953·2] . However  the antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were conserved against both the delta variant and wild-type SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine remained effective against moderate-to-severe COVID-19  even during a surge that was dominated by the highly transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Spike-specific T-cell responses were maintained against the delta variant. Such cellular immune protection might compensate for waning humoral immunity.

A Systematic Review,doi:10.3390/vaccines9111305,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111305,pubmed:34835238,pmc:PMC8622454,Vaccines (Basel),2021,Vaccine versus Variants  3Vs : Are the COVID-19 Vaccines Effective against the Variants? A Systematic Review,Background: With the emergence and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants  concerns are raised about the effectiveness of the existing vaccines to protect against these new variants. Although many vaccines were found to be highly effective against the reference COVID-19 strain  the same level of protection may not be found against mutation strains. The objective of this study is to systematically review relevant studies in the literature and compare the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against new variants. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of research published in Scopus  PubMed  and Google Scholar until 30 August 2021. Studies including clinical trials  prospective cohorts  retrospective cohorts  and test negative case-controls that reported vaccine effectiveness against any COVID-19 variants were considered. PRISMA recommendations were adopted for screening  eligibility  and inclusion. Results: 129 unique studies were reviewed by the search criteria  of which 35 met the inclusion criteria. These comprised of 13 test negative case-control studies  6 Phase 1–3 clinical trials  and 16 observational studies. The study location  type  vaccines used  variants considered  and reported efficacies were highlighted. Conclusion: Full vaccination  two doses  offers strong protection against Alpha  B.1.1.7  with 13 out of 15 studies reporting more than 84% efficacy. The results are not conclusive against the Beta  B.1.351  variant for fully vaccinated individuals with 4 out of 7 studies reporting efficacies between 22 and 60% and 3 out of 7 studies reporting efficacies between 75 and 100%. Protection against Gamma  P.1  variant was lower than 50% according to two studies in fully vaccinated individuals. The data on Delta  B.1.617.2  variant is limited but indicates lower protection compared to other variants.

We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12 476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31  2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein  a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients  individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold  a proxy for higher virus load  and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants  e.g.  B.1.429 and B.1.427  Epsilon   P.1  Gamma   P.2  Zeta   and R.1  also increased rapidly  although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1  Kappa  or B.1.617.2  Delta  variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases  n=207  in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes  including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate  our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area  documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston  and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.

CP has been in use for at least a century to provide passive immunity against a number of diseases  and was recently proposed by the World Health Organization for human Ebola virus infection. Only a few small studies have so far been published on patients with COVID-19 and concomitant hematological malignancies  HM . The Italian Hematology Alliance on HM and COVID-19 has found that HM patients with COVID-19 clinically perform more poorly than those with either HM or COVID-19 alone. A COVID-19 infection in patients with B-cell lymphoma is associated with impaired generation of neutralizing antibody titers and lowered clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Treatment with CP was seen to increase antibody titers in all patients and to improve clinical response in 80% of patients examined. However  a recent study has reported impaired production of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in an immunosuppressed individual treated with CP  possibly supporting the notion of virus escape  particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. This may limit the efficacy of CP treatment in at least some HM patients. More recently  it has been shown that CP may provide a neutralising effect against B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants  thus expanding its application in clinical practice. More extensive studies are needed to further assess the use of CP in COVID-19-infected HM patients.

We implemented a combined approach to quickly detect known VOCs while continuously monitoring for evolving mutations of the virus. To rapidly detect VOCs  two real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays were designed and implemented  targeting the spike gene H69 V70 deletion and the N501Y mutation. The H69 V70 deletion and N501Y mutation assays demonstrated accuracies of 98.3%  95% CI 93.8 to 99.8  and 100%  95% CI 96.8 to 100   limits of detection of 1 089 and 294 copies ml  and percent coefficients of variation of 0.08 to 1.16% and 0 to 2.72% for the two gene targets  respectively. No cross-reactivity with common respiratory pathogens was observed with either assay. Implementation of these tests allowed the swift escalation in testing for VOCs from 2.2% to ∼100% of all SARS-CoV-2-positive samples over 12 January to 9 February 2021  and resulted in the detection of a rapid rise of B.1.1.7 cases within the province of Alberta  Canada. A prospective comparison of the VOC assays to genome sequencing for the detection of B.1.1.7  combined detection of P.1 and B.1.351  and wild-type  i.e.  non-VOC  lineages showed sensitivities of 98.2 to 100%  specificities of 98.9 to 100%  positive predictive values of 76.9% to 100%  and negative predictive values of 96 to 100%. Variant screening results inform sampling strategies for regular surveillance by genome sequencing  thus allowing rapid identification of known VOCs while continuously monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the province. IMPORTANCE Different strains  or variants  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  have emerged that have higher levels of transmission  less susceptibility to our immune response  and possibly cause more severe disease than previous strains of the virus. Rapid detection of these variants of concern is important to help contain them and prevent them from spreading widely within the population. This study describes two newly developed tests that are able to identify and differentiate the variants of concern from regular strains of SARS-CoV-2. These tests are faster and simpler than the main  gold standard method of identifying variants of concern  genome sequencing . These tests also demonstrated a high correlation with genome sequencing and allowed for the rapid and accurate detection of the rise of B.1.1.7  one of the variants of concern  in the province of Alberta  Canada.

Immune correlates of vaccine protection against Omicron are not known. METHODS: 30 cynomolgus macaques were immunized with homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine and the adenovirus vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Following vaccination  animals were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. RESULTS: Omicron neutralizing antibodies were observed following the boost immunization and were higher in animals that received BNT162b2  whereas Omicron CD8+ T cell responses were higher in animals that received Ad26.COV2.S. Following Omicron challenge  sham controls showed more prolonged virus in nasal swabs than in bronchoalveolar lavage. Vaccinated macaques demonstrated rapid control of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage  and most vaccinated animals also controlled virus in nasal swabs  showing that current vaccines provide substantial protection against Omicron in this model. However  vaccinated animals that had moderate levels of Omicron neutralizing antibodies but negligible Omicron CD8+ T cell responses failed to control virus in the upper respiratory tract. Virologic control correlated with both antibody and T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against high-dose challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in macaques. Protection against this highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant correlated with both humoral and cellular immune responses.

Torus Synestia Nucleic Acid Analysis Platform for Fast  High Multiplex Analysis of Nucleic Acids With Single-Nucleotide Discrimination Level,BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification testing  NAAT  is an essential tool both for biomedical research and for clinical molecular diagnostics. Currently  there are multiple NAAT platforms available  each offering certain performance and utility advantages and disadvantages as compared to each other. Next generation NAAT platforms aim to deliver increased target detection sensitivity and specificity  low limits of target detection  quantitative high multiplex target capacity  rapid time to results  and simple sample-to-answer workflow. METHODS: Here we describe the Torus Synestia System  a NAAT platform capable of rapid  highly multiplexed amplification and detection of both DNA and RNA targets. The platform comprises a small  portable  ~ 2kg  amplification and detection device and a disposable single-use cartridge housing a PCR amplification chamber with an integrated label-free microarray for real-time data acquisition and interpretation. The platform offers a 30-min turnaround time with a detection limit of 10 DNA RNA molecules per assay and single nucleotide discrimination. RESULTS: We demonstrate the Synestia System performance and utility with three distinct molecular applications: 1  detection of 20 genetic loci and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms in human genomic DNA; 2  detection and genotyping of 43 unique bacterial species associated with human urinary tract infections; and 3  detection and profiling human respiratory viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-1 2  seasonal coronaviruses  Influenza A B  and human respiratory syncytial viruses. In addition  the single-nucleotide specificity of our label-free microarray probes allowed for robust identification and discrimination of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages  such as B.1.1.7  a.k.a. UK   B.1.351  a.k.a. South African   P.1  a.k.a. Brazilian   and B.1.617  a.k.a. Indian . CONCLUSION: The Torus Synestia System has broad applicability in both clinical and research environments. We are confident that the Torus Synestia System will revolutionize syndromic diagnostics at the point of care  PoC  and lead to improved response times during future epidemic and pandemic pathogen outbreaks.

Viruses can hijack the glycosylation machinery of host cells to shield themselves from the host's immune response and attenuate antibody efficiency. However  it remains unclear if targeting glycosylation on viral spike protein can impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. METHODS: We adopted flow cytometry  ELISA  and BioLayer interferometry approaches to assess binding of glycosylated or deglycosylated spike with ACE2. Viral entry was determined by luciferase  immunoblotting  and immunofluorescence assays. Genome-wide association study  GWAS  revealed a significant relationship between STT3A and COVID-19 severity. NF-κB STT3A-regulated N-glycosylation was investigated by gene knockdown  chromatin immunoprecipitation  and promoter assay. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate  ADC  that couples non-neutralization anti-spike antibody with NGI-1  4G10-ADC  to specifically target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. FINDINGS: The receptor binding domain and three distinct SARS-CoV-2 surface N-glycosylation sites among 57 311 spike proteins retrieved from the NCBI-Virus-database are highly evolutionarily conserved  99.67%  and are involved in ACE2 interaction. STT3A is a key glycosyltransferase catalyzing spike glycosylation and is positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. We found that inhibiting STT3A using N-linked glycosylation inhibitor-1  NGI-1  impaired SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that of its variants [Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Beta  B.1.351 ]. Most importantly  4G10-ADC enters SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and NGI-1 is subsequently released to deglycosylate spike protein  thereby reinforcing the neutralizing abilities of antibodies  vaccines  or convalescent sera and reducing SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that targeting evolutionarily-conserved STT3A-mediated glycosylation via an ADC can exert profound impacts on SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity. Thus  we have identified a novel deglycosylation method suitable for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 variant infection in vitro.

There are currently several licensed vaccines approved for human use and most of them target the spike protein in the virion envelope to induce protective immunity. Recently  variants that spread more quickly have emerged. There is evidence that some of these variants are less sensitive to neutralization in vitro  but it is not clear whether they can evade vaccine induced protection. In this study  we tested SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a vaccine antigen and explored the effect of formulation with Alum MPLA or AddaS03 adjuvants. Our results show that RBD induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies and activates strong cellular immune responses. There is also significant cross-neutralization of variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and to a lesser extent  SARS-CoV-1. These results indicate that recombinant RBD can be a viable candidate as a stand-alone vaccine or as a booster shot to diversify our strategy for COVID19 protection.

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections  admissions to hospital for covid-19  and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination  odds ratio up to 1.48  95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77   indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination  reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70%  95% confidence interval 59% to 78%   then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89%  85% to 93%  was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January  when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced  had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2  vaccine effectiveness reached 61%  51% to 69%  from 28 to 34 days after vaccination  then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S  effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination  reaching an effectiveness of 60%  41% to 73%  from 28 to 34 days  increasing to 73%  27% to 90%  from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease  a further 43%  33% to 52%  reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51%  37% to 62%  reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37%  3% to 59%  reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease  a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults  and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up  >6 weeks . A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease. A clear effect of the vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant was found.

Clinical data on the assessment of the immune response in vaccinated pregnant women and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer are quite limited. Objective: To assess maternal and neonatal neutralizing antibody levels against both wildtype and Delta  B.1.617.2  variants after maternal mRNA vaccination. Study Design: This cohort study was conducted 29 pregnant women who were vaccinated at least one dose of Moderna  mRNA-1273  vaccine. Both neutralizing antibody  wildtype and Delta variant  and S1 receptor binding domain IgG antibody levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood on the day of delivery. Results: Superiority of antibody level was significant in fully vaccinated women compared with the one-dose group  maternal sera  median  97.46%; cord sera  median  97.37% versus maternal sera  median  4.01%; cord sera  median  1.44% . No difference in antibody level was noted in relation to interval of second immunization to delivery in the two-dose group  95.99% in 0–2 weeks  97.45% in 2–4 weeks  97.48% in 4–8 weeks  97.72% in 8–10 weeks . The most pronounced reduction was observed for the Delta variant. The wildtype neutralizing antibody level of full-vaccinated women was not influenced by the pertussis vaccination. Conclusion: The data underscore the importance of full vaccination in pregnancy and support the recommendation of COVID-19 immunization for pregnant women. The lower level of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies for the Delta variant indicates insufficient protection for mother and newborn and highlights the need for development of effective vaccine strategies.

This study examined the impact of glycan-masking mutants of the N-terminal domain  NTD  and receptor-binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2  and found that the antigenic design of the S protein increases the neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral strain and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta  B.1.617.2 . Our results demonstrated that the use of glycan-masking Ad-S-R158N Y160T in the NTD elicited a 2.8-fold  6.5-fold  and 4.6-fold increase in the IC-50 NT titer against the Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351  and Delta  B.1.617.2  variants  respectively. Glycan-masking of Ad-S-D428N in the RBD resulted in a 3.0-fold and 2.0-fold increase in the IC-50 neutralization titer against the Alpha  B.1.1.7  and Beta  B.1.351  variants  respectively. The use of glycan-masking in Ad-S-R158N Y160T and Ad-S-D428N antigen design may help develop universal COVID-19 vaccines against current and future emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Over the course of the ongoing pandemic a number of new SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates or variants of concern  VoC  have been identified containing mutations in key proteins. METHODS: In this study we describe the generation and preclinical assessment of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine  AZD2816  which expresses the spike protein of the Beta VoC  B.1.351 . FINDINGS: We demonstrate that AZD2816 is immunogenic after a single dose. When AZD2816 is used as a booster dose in animals primed with a vaccine encoding the original spike protein  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  [AZD1222]   an increase in binding and neutralising antibodies against Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1  and Delta  B.1.617.2  is observed following each additional dose. In addition  a strong and polyfunctional T cell response was measured all booster regimens. INTERPRETATION: Real world data is demonstrating that one or more doses of licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines confer reduced protection against hospitalisation and deaths caused by divergent VoC  including Omicron. Our data support the ongoing clinical development and testing of booster vaccines to increase immunity against highly mutated VoC. FUNDING: This research was funded by AstraZeneca with supporting funds from MRC and BBSRC.

However  whether Omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern  VOCs  remains unknown. We use plasma from 20 unvaccinated and seven vaccinated individuals infected by Omicron BA.1 to test binding  Fc effector function and neutralization against VOCs. In unvaccinated individuals  Fc effector function and binding antibodies target Omicron and other VOCs at comparable levels. However  Omicron BA.1-triggered neutralization is not extensively cross-reactive for VOCs  14 to 31-fold titer reduction  and we observe 4-fold decreased titers against Omicron BA.2. In contrast  vaccination followed by breakthrough Omicron infection associates with improved cross-neutralization of VOCs  with titers exceeding 1:2 100. This has important implications for vulnerability of unvaccinated Omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging VOCs. While Omicron-based immunogens may be adequate boosters  they are unlikely to be superior to existing vaccines for priming in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals.

We examined whether sera from recovered and nave donors collected prior to  and following immunizations with existing mRNA vaccines  could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351  but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of nave donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses  but at lower titers. Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies.

Only few reports describe intrauterine or intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infections in newborns. To understand the route of transmission  detection of the virus or virus nucleic acid in the placenta and amniotic tissue are of special interest. Current methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue are immunohistochemistry  electron microscopy  in-situ hybridization  polymerase chain reaction  PCR  and next-generation sequencing. Recently  we described an alternative method for the detection of viral ribonucleic acid  RNA   by combination of reverse transcriptase-PCR and mass spectrometry  MS  in oropharyngeal and oral swabs. In this report  we could detect SARS-CoV-2 in formal-fixed and paraffin-embedded  FFPE  placental and amniotic tissue by multiplex RT-PCR MS. Additionally  we could identify the British variant  B.1.1.7  of the virus in this tissue by the same methodology. Combination of RT-PCR with MS is a fast and easy method to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA  including specific variants in FFPE tissue.

From weeks 11 2020–24 2021  SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory samples were randomly selected per clinical setting  80% from primary care or 20% from the hospital   age group  and week. WGS was performed following the ARTICv3 protocol on MiSeq or NextSeq2000 Illumina platforms. Nearly complete consensus sequences were used for genetic characterization based on GISAID and PANGOLIN nomenclatures. From 2475 samples  2166  87%  were fully sequenced  78% from primary care and 22% from hospital settings . Multiple genetic lineages were co-circulating  but four were predominant at different periods. While B.1.5  50.68%  and B.1.1  32.88%  were the major lineages during the first pandemic wave  B.1.177  66.85%  and B.1.1.7  83.80%  were predominant during the second  third  and fourth waves  respectively. Almost all  96.4%  were carrying D614G mutation in the S protein  with additional mutations that define lineages or variants. But some mutations of concern  such as E484K from B.1.351 and P.1 lineages are currently under monitoring  together with those observed in the receptor-binding domain or N-terminal domain  such as L452R and T478K from B.1.617.2 lineage. The fact that a predominant lineage was observed in each pandemic wave suggests advantageous properties over other contemporary co-circulating variants. This genetic variability should be monitored  especially when a massive vaccination campaign is ongoing because the potential selection and emergence of novel antigenic SARS-CoV-2 strains related to immunological escapement events.

The Delta variant has been associated with greater transmissibility and higher viral RNA loads in both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals. Data is lacking regarding the infectious virus load in Delta infected individuals and how that compares to individuals infected with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing of 2 785 clinical isolates was used to characterize the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the National Capital Region between January and July 2021. Clinical chart reviews were performed for the Delta  Alpha  and B.1.2  a control predominant lineage prior to both VOCs  variants to evaluate disease severity and outcome and Cycle threshold values  Cts  were compared. The presence of infectious virus was determined using Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined from upper respiratory specimen. An analysis of infection in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations was performed. RESULTS: The Delta variant displaced the Alpha variant to constitute 88.2% of the circulating lineages in the National Capital Region by July  2021. The Delta variant associated with increased breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals that were mostly symptomatic when compared to the Alpha breakthrough infections  though it is important to note there was a significantly longer period of time between vaccination and infection with Delta infections. The recovery of infectious virus on cell culture was significantly higher with the Delta variant compared to Alpha in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The impact of vaccination on reducing the recovery of infectious virus from clinical samples was only observed with Alpha variant infections but was strongly associated with low localized SARS-CoV-2 IgG for both variants. A comparison of Ct values showed a significant decrease in the Delta compared to Alpha with no significant differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the Delta variant is associated with increased infectious virus loads when compared to the Alpha variant and decreased upper respiratory antiviral IgG levels. Measures to reduce transmission in addition to increasing vaccinations rates have to be implemented to reduce Delta variant spread.

Ecuador was the second country in South America to confirm cases and Guayaquil was one of the first cities in the world to experience high mortality due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the lineages circulating throughout the country and to compare the mutations in local variants  to the reference strain. In this work we used the MinION platform  Oxford Nanopore Technologies  to sequence the whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 119 patients from all provinces of Ecuador  using the ARTIC network protocols. Our data from lineage assignment of the one hundred and nineteen whole genomes revealed twenty different lineages. All genomes presented differences in the S gene compared to the Wuhan reference strain  being the D614G amino acid replacement the most common change. The B.1.1.119 lineage was the most frequent and was found in several locations in the Coast and Andean region. Three sequences were assigned to the new B.1.1.7 lineage. Our work is an important contribution to the understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Ecuador and South America.

Therefore  it is essential to understand the levels of protection that these vaccines provide in the face of emerging variants. Here  we report two demographically balanced cohorts of BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients  from which we evaluate neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.351  beta  variants. We show that both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are less well neutralized by serum from vaccinated individuals  and that B.1.351  but not B.1.1.7  is less well neutralized by convalescent serum. We also find that the levels of variant-specific anti-spike antibodies are proportional to neutralizing activities. Together  our results demonstrate the escape of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants from neutralization by serum antibodies  which may lead to reduced protection from re-infection or increased risk of vaccine breakthrough.

We have analyzed publicly available genomic data to understand the current COVID-19 outbreak scenario as well as the evolutionary origin and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh. All the early isolates as well as recent B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had already spread across the major divisional cities of Bangladesh. A sex biasness towards male COVID-19 patient samples sequencing has been observed over female patient samples in all age-group  that could be the trend in infection rate. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a total of 13 estimated countries  including Italy  India  United Kingdom  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates  Germany  Australia  New Zealand  South Africa  Democratic Republic of the Congo  United States  Russia  and Denmark  could be the possible origin introduced SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh because of regional and intercontinental travel. Recent  B.1.1.7 variant could be imported from a total of 7 estimated countries including UK  India  Nigeria  Spain  Ireland  Australia  and Indonesia  while South Africa and the United States are the most likely sources of B.1.351 variant in Bangladesh. Based on these findings  public health strategies could be designed and implemented to reduce the local transmission of the virus.

Nevertheless  the intensive human mobility across the dry border with Brazil is a major challenge for public health authorities. We aimed to investigate the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  strains detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil as well as to measure the viral flux across this ∼1 100 km uninterrupted dry frontier. Using complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Uruguayan–Brazilian bordering region and phylogeographic analyses  we inferred the virus dissemination frequency between Brazil and Uruguay and characterized local outbreak dynamics during the first months  May–July  of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the bordering region. The most probable sources of viral strains introduced to Uruguay were the Southeast Brazilian region and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some of the viral strains introduced in Uruguayan border localities between early May and mid-July were able to locally spread and originated the first outbreaks detected outside the metropolitan region. The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan urban outbreaks were defined by a set of between four and 11 mutations  synonymous and non-synonymous  with respect to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil  supporting the notion of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in South America. Although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens  the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated bi-national surveillance systems is crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the world.

This variant has 13 amino acid changes  three in its spike protein  which are currently of particular concern: E484Q  L452R  and P681R. Here  we report a major effect of the mutations characterizing this lineage  represented by a marked alteration of the surface electrostatic potential  EP  of the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein. Enhanced RBD‐EP is particularly noticeable in the B.1.617.2  δ  sublineage  which shows multiple replacements of neutral or negatively charged amino acids with positively charged amino acids. We here hypothesize that this EP change can favor the interaction between the B.1.617+ RBD and the negatively charged ACE2  thus conferring a potential increase in the virus transmission.

In this study  we explored the local and national landscape of the viral variants in the period immediately preceding the second wave to gain insight into the mechanism of emergence of the delta variant and thus improve our understanding of the causation of the second wave. We randomly selected 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples diagnosed in our lab between 3 February and 8 March 2021 and subjected them to whole genome sequencing. Nine of the 20 sequenced genomes were classified as kappa variant  B.1.617.1 . The phylogenetic analysis of pan-India SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences also suggested the gradual replacement of the α variant with the kappa variant during this period. This relative consolidation of the kappa variant was significant  since it shared 3 of the 4 signature mutations  L452R  E484Q and P681R  observed in the spike protein of delta variant and thus was likely to be the precursor in its evolution. This study demonstrates the predominance of the kappa variant in the period immediately prior to the second wave and underscores its role as the “bridging variant” between the α and delta variants that drove the first and second waves of COVID-19 in India  respectively.

We reported the epidemiological  viral  and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients infected with the Delta VOC during the local outbreak in Guangzhou  China. METHODS: We extracted the epidemiological and clinical information pertaining to the 159 cases infected with the Delta VOC across seven transmission generations between May 21 and June 18  2021. The whole chain of the Delta VOC transmission was described. Kinetics of viral load and clinical characteristics were compared with a cohort of wild-type infection in 2020 admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. FINDINGS: There were four transmission generations within the first ten days. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period  4.0 vs. 6.0 days   higher viral load  20.6 vs. 34.0  cycle threshold of the ORF1a b gene   and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples  14.0 vs. 8.0 days  compared with the wild-type strain. In cases with critical illness  the proportion of patients over the age of 60 was higher in the Delta VOC group than in the wild-type strain  100.0% vs. 69.2%  p = 0.03 . The Delta VOC had a higher risk than wild-type infection in deterioration to critical status  hazards ratio 2.98 [95%CI 1.29-6.86]; p = 0.01 . INTERPRETATION: Infection with the Delta VOC is characterized by markedly increased transmissibility  viral loads and risk of disease progression compared with the wild-type strain  calling for more intensive prevention and control measures to contain future outbreaks.

The receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the viral spike protein is a major target to develop candidate vaccines. α-Galactosylceramide  αGalCer   a potent invariant natural killer T cell  iNKT  agonist  was site-specifically conjugated to the N-terminus of the RBD to form an adjuvant–protein conjugate  which was anchored on the liposome surface. This is the first time that an iNKT cell agonist was conjugated to the protein antigen. Compared to the unconjugated RBD αGalCer mixture  the αGalCer-RBD conjugate induced significantly stronger humoral and cellular responses. The conjugate vaccine also showed effective cross-neutralization to all variants of concern  B.1.1.7 alpha  B.1.351 beta  P.1 gamma  B.1.617.2 delta  and B.1.1.529 omicron . These results suggest that the self-adjuvanting αGalCer-RBD has great potential to be an effective COVID-19 vaccine candidate  and this strategy might be useful for designing various subunit vaccines.

In addition to being a source of energy  polyPs have cytoprotective and antiviral activities. Here  we investigated the antiviral activities of long-chain polyPs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection. In molecular docking analyses  polyPs interacted with several conserved amino acid residues in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   the host receptor that facilitates virus entry  and in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp . ELISA and limited proteolysis assays using nano– LC-MS MS mapped polyP120 binding to ACE2  and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified the specific amino acid residues involved. PolyP120 enhanced the proteasomal degradation of both ACE2 and RdRp  thus impairing replication of the British B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. We thus tested polyPs for functional interactions with the virus in SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero E6 and Caco2 cells and in primary human nasal epithelial cells. Delivery of a nebulized form of polyP120 reduced the amounts of viral positive-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs  of RNA transcripts encoding proinflammatory cytokines  and of viral structural proteins  thereby presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells in vitro.

The N501Y substitution is the only mutation in the interface between the RBD of B.1.1.7 and ACE2  raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here  we assessed the neutralizing activity and binding affinity of a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies against the wild type and N501Y mutant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and RBD protein  respectively. We found that the neutralization activity and binding affinity of most detected antibodies  10 out of 12  were unaffected  although the N501Y substitution decreased the neutralizing and binding activities of CB6 and increased that of BD-23. These findings could be of value in the development of therapeutic antibodies. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186 s12985-021-01554-8.

INO-4800 DNA Vaccine Induces Neutralizing Antibodies and T cell Activity Against Global SARS-CoV-2 Variants,BACKGROUND: Global surveillance has identified emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC  associated with increased transmissibility  disease severity  and resistance to neutralization by current vaccines under emergency use authorization  EUA . Here we assessed cross-immune responses of INO-4800 vaccinated subjects against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. METHODS: We used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA and a pseudo neutralization assay to assess humoral responses  and an IFNγ ELISpot to measure cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 VOC in subjects immunized with the DNA vaccine  INO-4800. RESULTS: IgG binding titers were not impacted between wild-type  WT  and B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants. An average 1.9-fold reduction was observed for the P.1 variant in subjects tested at week 8 after receiving two doses of INO-4800  Figure 1a . We performed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay using sera collected from 13 subjects two weeks after administration of a third dose of either 0.5 mg  1 mg  or 2 mg of INO-4800. Neutralization was detected against WT and the emerging variants in all samples tested. The mean ID 50  titers for the WT  B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1. were 643  range: 70-729   295  range: 46-886   105  range: 25-309   and 664  range: 25-2087   respectively. Compared to WT  there was a 2.1 and 6.9-fold reduction for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  respectively  while there was no difference between WT and the P.1 variant  Figure 1b . Next  we compared cellular immune responses to WT and SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants elicited by INO-4800 vaccination. We observed similar cellular responses to WT  median = 82.2 IQR = 58.9-205.3   B.1.1.7  79.4  IQR = 38.9- 179.7   B.1.351  80  IQR = 40.0-208.6  and P.1  78.3  IQR = 53.1-177.8  Spike peptides  Figure 2 . [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: INO-4800 vaccination induced neutralizing antibodies against all variants tested  with reduced levels detected against B.1.351. IFNγ T cell responses were fully maintained against all variants tested. DISCLOSURES: Viviane M. Andrade  PhD  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.

doi:10.1101/2021.12.06.21267375,SARS-CoV-2 attack rate and population immunity in southern New England  March 2020 - May 2021,doi:10.1101/2021.12.06.21267375,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.21267375v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34909789/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.06.21267375,pubmed:34909789,pmc:PMC8669856,medRxiv,2021,SARS-CoV-2 attack rate and population immunity in southern New England  March 2020 - May 2021,Estimating an infectious disease attack rate requires inference on the number of reported symptomatic cases of a disease  the number of unreported symptomatic cases  and the number of asymptomatic infections. Population-level immunity can then be estimated as the attack rate plus the number of vaccine recipients who had not been previously infected; this requires an estimate of the fraction of vaccines that were distributed to seropositive individuals. To estimate attack rates and population immunity in southern New England  we fit a validated dynamic epidemiological model to case  clinical  and death data streams reported by Rhode Island  Massachusetts  and Connecticut for the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic  from March 1 2020 to May 31 2021. This period includes the initial spring 2020 wave  the major winter wave of 2020–2021  and the lagging wave of lineage B.1.1.7 Alpha  infections during March-April 2021. In autumn 2020  SARS-CoV-2 population immunity  equal to the attack rate at that point  in southern New England was still below 15%  setting the stage for a large winter wave. After the roll-out of vaccines in early 2021  population immunity in many states was expected to approach 70% by spring 2021  with more than half of this immune population coming from vaccinations. Our population immunity estimates for May 31 2021 are 73.4%  95% CrI: 72.9% – 74.1%  for Rhode Island  64.1%  95% CrI: 64.0% – 64.4%  for Connecticut  and 66.3%  95% CrI: 65.9% – 66.9%  for Massachusetts  indicating that >33% of southern Englanders were still susceptible to infection when the Delta variant began spreading in July 2021. Despite high vaccine coverage in these states  population immunity in summer 2021 was lower than planned due to 34%  Rhode Island   25%  Connecticut   and 28%  Massachusetts  of vaccine distribution going to seropositive individuals. Future emergency-setting vaccination planning will likely have to consider over-vaccination as a strategy to ensure that high levels of population immunity are reached during the course of an ongoing epidemic.

In late 2020  several “variants of concern” emerged globally  including the UK variant  B.1.1.7   South Africa variant  B.1.351   Brazil variants  P.1 and P.2   and two related California “variants of interest”  B.1.429 and B.1.427 . These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants  there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20 453 COVID-19 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021  we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency  aggregate of 1.1%  in the population  they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates  increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence  frequency  and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination.

Neither COVID-19 vaccination nor COVID-19 testing was required before either event. As of August 13  a total of 180 confirmed and probable cases had been identified among attendees at the two events and their close contacts. Among the 122 cases associated with the camp or the conference  primary cases   18 were in persons who were fully vaccinated  with 38 close contacts. Eight of these 38 close contacts subsequently became infected with SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  secondary cases ; among the eight close contacts with secondary cases  one half  four  were fully vaccinated. Among the 180 total persons with outbreak-associated cases  five  2.8%  were hospitalized; no deaths occurred. None of the vaccinated persons with cases were hospitalized. Approximately 1 000 persons across at least four states were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through attendance at these events or through close contact with a person who had a primary case. This investigation underscores the impact of secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission during large events  such as camps and conferences  when COVID-19 prevention strategies are not implemented. In Los Angeles County  California  during July 2021  when the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant was predominant  unvaccinated residents were five times more likely to be infected and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized from infection than were vaccinated residents  1 . Implementation of multiple prevention strategies  including vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions such as masking  physical distancing  and screening testing  are critical to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and serious complications from COVID-19.

In this period  contrarily to January–March 2021  variants of concern  VOC  β  B.1.351 lineage  and or γ  P.1 lineage  had a significant transmission advantage over VOC α  B.1.1.7 lineage  in Île-de-France  15.8%; 95% confidence interval  CI : 15.5–16.2  and Hauts-de-France  17.3%; 95% CI: 15.9–18.7  regions. This is consistent with VOC β’s immune evasion abilities and high proportions of prior-SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in these regions.

B.1.617.2 replaced B.1.1.7 as the dominant virus in the United Kingdom  resulting in a steep increase in new infections  and a similar development is expected for other countries. Effective countermeasures require information on susceptibility of B.1.617.2 to control by antibodies elicited by vaccines and used for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  therapy. We show  using pseudotyping  that B.1.617.2 evades control by antibodies induced upon infection and BNT162b2 vaccination  although to a lesser extent as compared to B.1.351. We find that B.1.617.2 is resistant against bamlanivimab  a monoclonal antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy. Finally  we show increased Calu-3 lung cell entry and enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of B.1.617.2  which may contribute to augmented transmissibility and pathogenicity of this variant. These results identify B.1.617.2 as an immune evasion variant with increased capacity to enter and fuse lung cells.

In this work  a bioinformatic approach to guide the design of PCR primers was developed  and an alternative diagnostic test based on end-point PCR was designed. End-point PCR primers were designed through conservation analysis based on kmer frequency in SARS-CoV-2 and human respiratory pathogen genomes. Highly conserved regions were identified for primer design  and the resulting PCR primers were used to amplify 871 nasopharyngeal human samples with a previous RT-qPCR based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. The diagnostic test showed high accuracy in identifying SARS-CoV-2-positive samples including B.1.1.7  P.1  B.1.427 B.1.429 and B.1.617.2  AY samples with a detection limit of 7.2 viral copies µL. In addition  this test could discern SARS-CoV-2 infection from other viral infections with COVID-19-like symptomatology. The designed end-point PCR diagnostic test to detect SARS-CoV-2 is a suitable alternative to RT-qPCR. Since the proposed bioinformatic approach can be easily applied in thousands of viral genomes and over highly divergent strains  it can be used as a PCR design tool as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. Therefore  this end-point PCR test could be employed in epidemiological surveillance to detect new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge and propagate.

To measure the severity and potential alternative approaches against black fungus coinfection in COVID‐19 patients  PubMed  Google Scholar  World Health Organization  WHO  newsletters  and other online resources  based on the cases reported and retrospective observational analysis were searched from the years 2015–2021. The studies reporting mucormycosis with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS‐CoV‐2  coinfection and or demonstrating potential risk factors  such as a history of diabetes mellitus or suppressed immune system were included  and reports published in non‐English language were excluded. More than 20 case reports and observational studies on black fungus coinfection in COVID‐19 patients were eligible for inclusion. The results indicated that diabetes mellitus  hyperglycemic  and immunocompromised COVID‐19 patients with mucormycosis were at a higher risk. We found that it was prudent to assess the potential risk factors and severity of invasive mycosis via standardized diagnostic and clinical settings. Large‐scale studies need to be conducted to identify early biomarkers and optimization of diagnostic methods has to be established per population and geographical variation. This will not only help clinicians around the world to detect the coinfection in time but also will prepare them for future outbreaks of other potential pandemics.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped spherical-shaped virus. The ribonucleic acid  RNA  is oriented in a 5’-3’direction which makes it a positive sense RNA virus  and the RNA can be read directly as a messenger RNA. The nonstructural protein 14  nsp14  has proofreading activity which allows the rate of mutations to stay low. A change in the genetic sequence is called a mutation. Genomes that differ from each other in genetic sequence are called variants. Variants are the result of mutations but differ from each other by one or more mutations. When a phenotypic difference is demonstrated among the variants  they are called strains. Viruses constantly change in two different ways  antigenic drift and antigenic shift. SARS-CoV-2 genome is also prone to various mutations that led to antigenic drift resulting in escape from immune recognition. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  updates the variant strains in the different classes. The classes are variant of interest  variant of concern and variant of high consequence. The current variants included in the variant of interest by the USA are: B.1.526  B.1.525  and P.2; and those included in the variant of concern by the USA are B.1.1.7  P.1  B.1.351  B.1.427  and B.1.429. The double and triple mutant variants first reported in India have resulted in a massive increase in the number of cases. Emerging variants not only result in increased transmissibility  morbidity and mortality  but also have the ability to evade detection by existing or currently available diagnostic tests  which can potentially delay the diagnosis and treatment  exhibit decreased susceptibility to treatment including antivirals  monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma  possess the ability to cause reinfection in previously infected and recovered individuals  and vaccine breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated individuals. Hence  continuation of precautionary measures  genomic surveillance and vaccination plays an important role in the prevention of spread  early identification of variants  prevention of mutations and viral replication  respectively.

As campuses prepared for a return to in-person education  many institutions were mandating vaccines for students and considering the same for faculty and staff. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between vaccination coverage and the levels and spread of SARS-CoV-2  even in the presence of highly-transmissible variants and congregate living  at a midsized university in the US. DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series was conducted at a midsized Midwestern university during the spring 2021 semester. The university developed a saliva-based surveillance program capable of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing and genomic sequencing with the capacity to deliver results in less than 24 hours. On April 7  2021  the university announced a vaccine requirement for all students for the fall 2021 semester and announced the same requirement for faculty and staff on May 20  2021. The university hosted an onsite mass vaccination clinic using the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine during April 8 to 15 and April 29 to May 6  2021. Data were analyzed for 14 894 individuals from the university population who were tested for COVID-19 on campus from January 6 to May 20  2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of saliva specimens  and variant identity was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing of viral genomes. RESULTS: Between January 6 and May 20  2021  the university conducted 196 185 COVID-19 tests for 14 894 individuals and identified 1603 positive cases. Within those positive cases  950 individuals  59.3%  were male  644  40.2%  were female  1426  89.0%  were students  and 1265  78.9%  were aged 17 to 22 years. Among the 1603 positive cases  687 were identified via polymerase chain reaction of saliva specimens. The Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant constituted 218 of the 446 total positives sequenced  48.9% . By May 20  2021  10 068 of 11 091 students  90.8%   814 of 883 faculty  92.2%   and 2081 of 2890 staff  72.0%  were vaccinated. The 7-day rolling average of positive cases peaked at 37 cases on February 17 but declined to zero by May 14  2021. The 7-day moving average of positive cases was inversely associated with cumulative vaccination coverage  with a statistically significant Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.57  95% CI  −0.68 to −0.44 . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case series study elucidated the association of a robust vaccination program with a statistically significant decrease in positive COVID-19 cases among the study population even in the presence of highly transmissible variants and congregate living.

Prophylactic vaccines have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for the prevention of COVID-19. Identification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  is important to assess vaccine protection efficacy  including their ability to protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VoC . Here  we report the generation and use of a recombinant  r SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1 2020  WA-1  strain expressing Venus and an rSARS-CoV-2 strain expressing mCherry and containing mutations K417N  E484K  and N501Y found in the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike  S  glycoprotein of the South African  SA  B.1.351  beta [β]  VoC in bifluorescent-based assays to rapidly and accurately identify human monoclonal antibodies  hMAbs  able to neutralize both viral infections in vitro and in vivo. Importantly  our bifluorescent-based system accurately recapitulated findings observed using individual viruses. Moreover  fluorescent-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 strain and the parental wild-type  WT  rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain had similar viral fitness in vitro  as well as similar virulence and pathogenicity in vivo in the K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that these new fluorescent-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used in vitro and in vivo to easily identify hMAbs that simultaneously neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 strains  including VoC  for the rapid assessment of vaccine efficacy or the identification of prophylactic and or therapeutic broadly NAbs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is responsible of the COVID-19 pandemic that has warped daily routines and socioeconomics. There is still an urgent need for prophylactics and therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study  we demonstrate the feasibility of using bifluorescent-based assays for the rapid identification of hMAbs with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2  including VoC in vitro and in vivo. Importantly  results obtained with these bifluorescent-based assays recapitulate those observed with individual viruses  demonstrating their feasibility to rapidly advance our understanding of vaccine efficacy and to identify broadly protective human NAbs for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care admission  mortality in patients who are critically ill  and overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these two groups. METHODS: For this observational cohort study  we linked large primary care  QResearch   national critical care  Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre Case Mix Programme   and national COVID-19 testing  Public Health England  databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure  SGTF  as a proxy for the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from the data: the primary care cohort  comprising patients in primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1  2020  and Jan 26  2021  and known SGTF status; and the critical care cohort  comprising patients admitted for critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1  2020  and Jan 27  2021  and known SGTF status. We explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit  CCU   28-day mortality  and 28-day mortality following CCU admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age  sex  geographical region  other sociodemographic factors  deprivation index  ethnicity  household housing category  and smoking status for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity  body-mass index  deprivation index  and dependency before admission to acute hospital for the CCU cohort   and comorbidities  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  type 1 and 2 diabetes  and hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular disease  respiratory disease  metastatic disease  and immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort . We reported information on types and duration of organ support for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups. FINDINGS: The primary care cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these  117 926  59·4%  had lineage B.1.1.7  836  0·4%  were admitted to CCU  and 899  0·4%  died within 28 days. The critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of these  2685  62·8%  had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662  15·5%  died at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort  we estimated adjusted hazard ratios  HRs  of 2·15  95% CI 1·75–2·65  for CCU admission and 1·65  1·36–2·01  for 28-day mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical care  estimated with the critical care cohort  was 0·91  0·76–1·09  for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with those with non-B.1.1.7 infection. INTERPRETATION: Patients with lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and 28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care  mortality appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and infection with COVID-19.

The causative organism  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   is a beta coronavirus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Many clinically significant variants have emerged  as the virus’s genome is prone to various mutations  leading to antigenic drift and resulting in evasion of host immune recognition. The current variants of concern  VOCs  include B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   B.1.617 B.1.617.2  Delta   and P.1  Gamma . The emerging variants contain various important mutations on the spike protein  leading to deleterious consequences  such as immune invasion and vaccine escape. These adverse effects result in increased transmissibility  morbidity  and mortality and the evasion of detection by existing or currently available diagnostic tests  potentially delaying diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses the key mutations present in the VOC strains and provides insights into how these mutations allow for greater transmissibility and immune evasion than the progenitor strain. Continuous monitoring and surveillance of VOC strains play a vital role in preventing and controlling the virus’s spread.

All but one of the newly-characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1  the most frequently identified in European countries  including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed  without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations  indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February  an effective reproduction number  R e   greater than 1 was estimated  which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March  confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

We estimated the risk of hospitalisation and admission to an intensive care unit  ICU  for infections with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Norway  compared to infections with non-VOC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked individual-level data from national registries  we conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway diagnosed between 28 December 2020 and 2 May 2021. Variants were identified based on whole genome sequencing  partial sequencing by Sanger sequencing or PCR screening for selected targets. The outcome was hospitalisation or ICU admission. We calculated adjusted risk ratios  aRR  with 95% confidence intervals  CIs  using multivariable binomial regression to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with i  hospital admission and ii  ICU admission compared to non-VOC. RESULTS: We included 23 169 cases of B.1.1.7  548 B.1.351 and 4 584 non-VOC. Overall  1 017 cases were hospitalised  3.6%  and 206 admitted to ICU  0.7% . B.1.1.7 was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of hospitalisation  aRR 95%CI 1.6–2.3  and a 1.8-fold increased risk of ICU admission  aRR 95%CI 1.2–2.8  compared to non-VOC. Among hospitalised cases  no difference was found in the risk of ICU admission between B.1.1.7 and non-VOC. B.1.351 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of hospitalisation  aRR 95%CI 1.7–3.3  and a 2.7-fold increased risk of ICU admission  aRR 95%CI 1.2–6.5  compared to non-VOC. DISCUSSION: Our findings add to the growing evidence of a higher risk of severe disease among persons infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. This highlights the importance of prevention and control measures to reduce transmission of these VOC in society  particularly ongoing vaccination programmes  and preparedness plans for hospital surge capacity.

The incidence domination was likely due to a fitness advantage that could be driven by the receptor-binding domain  RBD  residue change  N501Y   which also emerged independently in other variants of concern such as the beta B.1.351 and gamma P.1 strains. Here  we present a functional characterization of the alpha B.1.1.7 variant and show an eightfold affinity increase towards human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  ACE-2 . In accordance with this  transgenic hACE2 mice showed a faster disease progression and severity after infection with a low dose of B.1.1.7  compared to an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. When challenged with sera from convalescent individuals or anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies  the N501Y variant showed a minor  but significant elevated evasion potential of ACE-2 RBD antibody neutralization. The data suggest that the single asparagine to tyrosine substitution remarkable rise in affinity may be responsible for the higher transmission rate and severity of the B.1.1.7 variant.

METHODS: The study was performed in the context of health surveillance at the workplaces. We monitored the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs classified by having received the entire vaccine schedule or not; the latter further classified in not vaccinated workers and workers who had received the first shot more than 14 days earlier. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs  followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. The cumulative incidence of infections in the period was normalised to 100 000 people. RESULTS: At the end of the observation period  HCWs that had completed the full schedule were at lower infection risk than both unvaccinated HCWs and the workforce who had not yet gained the complete theoretical protection from the vaccine  by 2.4-folds . Overall  ninety-two SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed among HCWs  mostly among not protected workers  52 cases  but none of them showed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination campaign effectively reduced the appearance of symptoms and the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs. Among vaccinated HCWs  gene sequencing was possible in five cases only  4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants. The high rate of unsuccessful gene sequencing observed among infected vaccinated workers could be explained by a low viral burden. Vaccination for COVID-19 should be mandatory in occupational settings with a high infective risk.

RT-PCR-based variant tests can be used to screen large sample-sets rapidly and accurately for relevant variants of concern  VOC . The aim of this study was to establish and validate a multiplex assay on the cobas 6800 8800 systems to allow discrimination between the two currently circulating VOCs  Omicron and Delta  in clinical samples. Methods: Primers and probes were evaluated for multiplex compatibility. Analytic performance was assessed using cell culture supernatant of an Omicron variant isolate and a clinical Delta variant sample  normalized to WHO-Standard. Clinical performance of the multiplex assay was benchmarked against NGS results. Results: In silico testing of all oligos showed no interactions with a high risk of primer-dimer formation or amplification of human DNA RNA. Over 99.9% of all currently available Omicron variant sequences are a perfect match for at least one of the three Omicron targets included in the multiplex. Analytic sensitivity was determined as 19.0 IU mL  CI95%: 12.9–132.2 IU mL  for the A67V + del-HV69-70 target  193.9 IU mL  CI95%: 144.7–334.7 IU mL  for the E484A target  35.5 IU mL  CI95%: 23.3–158.0 IU mL  for the N679K + P681H target and 105.0 IU mL  CI95%: 80.7–129.3 IU mL  for the P681R target. All sequence variances were correctly detected in the clinical sample set  225 225 Targets . Conclusion: RT-PCR-based variant screening compared to whole genome sequencing is both rapid and reliable in detecting relevant sequence variations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples to exclude or verify relevant VOCs. This allows short-term decision-making  e.g.  for patient treatment or public health measures.

The original wild-type strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has genetically evolved  and several variants of concern  VOC  have emerged. On 26 November 2021  a new variant named Omicron  B.1.1.529  was designated as the fifth VOC  revealing that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to go beyond the available therapies. The high number of mutations harboured on the spike protein make Omicron highly transmissible  less responsive to several of the currently used drugs  as well as potentially able to escape immune protection elicited by both vaccines and previous infection. We reviewed the latest publication and the most recent available literature on the Omicron variant  enlightening both reasons for concern and high hopes for new therapeutic strategies.

We investigated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the first 40 patients with the omicron variant who had been isolated at the National Medical Center in South Korea during December 4–17  2021. The median age of the patients was 39.5 years. Twenty-two patients  55%  were women. Seventeen patients  42.5%  were fully vaccinated  and none were reinfected with the omicron. Eighteen  45%  had recent international travel history. Half of the patients  19  47.5%  were asymptomatic  while the others had mild symptoms. Six patients  15%  showed lung infiltrations on chest image; however  none required supplemental oxygen. These mild clinical features are consistent with recent case reports on the omicron variant from other countries.

Traditional medicinal plants have long history to treat viral infections. Our in silico approach suggested that unique phytocompounds such as emodin  thymol and carvacrol  and artemisinin could physically bind SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins  6VXX and 6VYB   SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 South Africa variant of Spike glycoprotein  7NXA   and even with ACE2 and prevent the SARS-CoV-2 binding to the host ACE2  TMPRSS2 and neutrapilin-1 receptors. Since Chloroquine has been looked as potential therapy against COVID-19  we also compared the binding of chloroquine and artemisinin for its interaction with spike proteins  6VXX  6VYB  and its variant 7NXA  respectively. Molecular docking study of phytocompounds and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed by using AutoDock Vina software. Molecular dynamics  MD  simulation was performed for 50ns. Among all the phytocompounds  molecular docking studies revealed lowest binding energy of artemisinin with 6VXX and 6VYB  with E total  −10.5 KJ mol −1  and −10.3 KJ mol −1  respectively. Emodin showed the best binding affinity with 6VYB with E total  −8.8 KJ mol −1 and SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant  7NXA  with binding energy of −6.4KJ mol −1 . Emodin showed best interactions with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with E total  of −7.1 and −7.3 KJ mol −1  respectively  whereas artemisinin interacts with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with E total  of −6.9 and −7.4 KJ mol −1  respectively. All the phytocompounds were non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. MD simulation showed that artemisinin has more stable interaction with 6VYB as compared to 6VXX  and hence proposed as potential phytochemical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE-2 receptor.

Here  we describe three cases of severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in vaccinated SOT recipients. Methods: Three SOT patients were hospitalized in the Policlinico Hospital of Bari  southern Italy  and underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes and spike protein mutations by real-time PCR. One sample was subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Results: One patient was a heart transplant recipient and two were kidney transplant recipients. All were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 between March and May 2021. Two patients were fully vaccinated and one had received only one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All the patients showed a high viral load at diagnosis  and molecular typing revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2. In all three cases  prolonged viral shedding was reported. Conclusions: The three cases pose concern about the role of the B.1.1.7 lineage in severe COVID-19 and about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Protecting immunocompromised patients from COVID-19 is a challenge. SOT recipients show a suboptimal response to standard vaccination  and thus  an additive booster or a combined vaccination strategy with mRNA  protein subunit  and vector-based vaccines may be necessary. This population should continue to practice strict COVID-19 precautions post-vaccination  until new strategies for protection are available.

The recent emergence of several genetically distinct descendants known as variants of concern  VOCs  is further challenging public health disease management  due to increased rates of virus transmission and potential constraints on vaccine effectiveness. We report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs imported into Australia belonging to the B.1.351 lineage  first described in the Republic of South Africa  RSA   and the B.1.1.7 lineage originally reported in the United Kingdom  and directly compare the replication kinetics of these two VOCs in Vero E6 cells. In this analysis  we also investigated a B.1.1.7 VOC  QLD1516 2021  carrying a 7-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame 7a  ORF7a  gene  likely truncating and rendering the ORF7a protein of this virus defective. We demonstrate that the replication of the B.1.351 VOC  QLD1520 2020  in Vero E6 cells can be detected earlier than the B.1.1.7 VOCs  QLD1516 2021 and QLD1517 2021   before peaking at 48 h post infection  p.i.   with significantly higher levels of virus progeny. Whilst replication of the ORF7a defective isolate QLD1516 2021 was delayed longer than the other viruses  slightly more viral progeny was produced by the mutant compared to the unmutated isolate QLD1517 2021 at 72 h p.i. Collectively  these findings contribute to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and evolutionary dynamics  which have important implications in the development of future vaccination  antiviral therapies  and epidemiological control strategies for COVID-19.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective analysis of international asymptomatic travellers entering Alberta  Canada. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were required to receive a PCR COVID-19 test on arrival. If negative  participants could leave quarantine but were required to have a second test 6 or 7 days after arrival. If the arrival test was positive  participants were required to remain in quarantine for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion and rate of participants testing positive for COVID-19; number of cases of secondary transmission. RESULTS: The analysis included 9535 international travellers entering Alberta by air  N=8398  or land  N=1137  that voluntarily enrolled in the Alberta Border Testing Pilot Programme  a subset of all travellers ; most  83.1%  were Canadian citizens. Among the 9310 participants who received at least one test  200  21.5 per 1000  95% CI 18.6 to 24.6  tested positive. Sixty-nine per cent  138 200  of positive tests were detected on arrival  14.8 per 1000 travellers  95% CI 12.5 to 17.5 . 62 cases  6.7 per 1000 travellers  95% CI 5.1 to 8.5; 31.0% of positive cases  were identified among participants that had been released from quarantine following a negative test result on arrival. Of 192 participants who developed symptoms  51  26.6%  tested positive after arrival. Among participants with positive tests  four  2.0%  were hospitalised for COVID-19; none required critical care or died. Contact tracing among participants who tested positive identified 200 contacts; of 88 contacts tested  22 were cases of secondary transmission  14 from those testing positive on arrival and 8 from those testing positive thereafter . SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage was not detected in any of the 200 positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: 21.5 per 1000 international travellers tested positive for COVID-19. Most  69%  tested positive on arrival and 31% tested positive during follow-up. These findings suggest the need for ongoing vigilance in travellers testing negative on arrival and highlight the value of follow-up testing and contact tracing to monitor and limit secondary transmission where possible.

Recently several virulent mutant strains of this virus  such as the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P1 lineages  have emerged with initial predominance in UK  South Africa  and Brazil. Another extremely pathogenic B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages  first detected in India  are now affecting some countries at notably stronger spread-rates. The present paper computationally examines the time-based structures of B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P1 lineages with selected spike protein mutations. The mutations in the more recently found B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages are explored  and the implications for multiple point mutations of the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain  RBD  are described. The selected S1 mutations within the highly contagious B.1.617.2 sub-lineage  also known as the delta variant  are examined as well.

Here we analysed immune responses following vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 2  in elderly participants and younger healthcare workers. Serum neutralization and levels of binding IgG or IgA after the first vaccine dose were lower in older individuals  with a marked drop in participants over eighty years old. Sera from participants above eighty showed lower neutralization potency against the B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta  and P.1.  Gamma  VOC than against the wild-type virus and were more likely to lack any neutralization against VOC following the first dose. However  following the second dose  neutralization against VOC was detectable regardless of age. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells was higher in elderly responders  whose serum showed neutralization activity  than in non-responders after the first dose. Elderly participants showed a clear reduction in somatic hypermutation of class-switched cells. The production of interferon-γ and interleukin-2 by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells was lower in older participants  and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high-risk population and that specific measures to boost vaccine responses in this population are warranted  particularly where variants of concern are circulating.

Here  we used the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey—a large community-based survey of individuals living in randomly selected private households across the United Kingdom—to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech  and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  Oxford–AstraZeneca; ChAdOx1  vaccines against any new SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests  split according to self-reported symptoms  cycle threshold value  <30 versus ≥30; as a surrogate for viral load  and gene positivity pattern  compatible with B.1.1.7 or not . Using 1 945 071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383 812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021  we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections ≥21 d after the first dose  61%  95% confidence interval  CI  = 54–68%  versus 66%  95% CI = 60–71%   respectively   with greater reductions observed after a second dose  79%  95% CI = 65–88%  versus 80%  95% CI = 73–85%   respectively . The largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections and or infections with a higher viral burden. Overall  COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections  with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections  and with no evidence of a difference between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines.

Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage –2 U.S. States  2021,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.574,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.574,,pmc:PMC8643738,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,373. Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage –2 U.S. States  2021,BACKGROUND: In December 2020  B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the United States and has since become the dominant lineage. Previous investigations involving B.1.1.7 suggested higher rates of transmission relative to non-B.1.1.7 lineages. We conducted a household transmission investigation to determine the secondary infection rates  SIR  of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: From January–April 2021  we enrolled members of households in San Diego County  CA  and Denver  CO metropolitan area  Tri-County   with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a household member with illness onset date in the previous 10 days. CDC investigators visited households at enrollment and 14 days later at closeout to obtain demographic and clinical data and nasopharyngeal  NP  samples on all consenting household members. Interim visits  with collection of NP swabs  occurred if a participant became symptomatic during follow-up. NP samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using TaqPath™ RT-PCR test  where failure to amplify the spike protein results in S-Gene target failure  SGTF  may indicate B.1.1.7 lineage. Demographic characteristics and SIR were compared among SGTF and non-SGTF households using two-sided p-values with chi-square tests; 95% confidence intervals  CI  were calculated with Wilson score intervals. RESULTS: 552 persons from 151 households were enrolled. 91  60%  households were classified as SGTF  57  38%  non-SGTF  and 3  2%  indeterminant. SGTF and non-SGTF households had similar sex distribution  49% female and 52% female  respectively; P=0.54  and age  median 30 years  interquartile range  IQR 14–47  and 31 years  IQR 15–45   respectively . Hispanic people accounted for 24% and 32% of enrolled members of SGTF and non-SGTF households  respectively  p=0.04 . At least one secondary case occurred in 61% of SGTF and 58% of non-SGTF households  P=0.66 . SIR was 52%  95%[CI] 46%-59%  for SGTF and 45%  95% CI 37%-53%  for non-SGTF households  P=0.18 . CONCLUSION: SIRs were high in both SGTF and non-SGTF households; our findings did not support an increase in SIR for SGTF relative to non-SGTF households in this setting. Sequence confirmed SARS-CoV-2 samples will provide further information on lineage specific SIRs. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures

We aimed to investigate  for the two main classes of vaccine  whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study  vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8  2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population  ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year  sex  and primary care practice  and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19  defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test  death within 28 days of first positive test  or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause. Although the data extracted for this study included cases presenting up to Sept 22  2021  the analyses reported here are restricted to cases and controls presenting from Dec 1  2020  to Sept 8  2021  ensuring follow-up for at least 14 days after presentation date to allow classification of hospitalisation and  for most cases  severity based on entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FINDINGS: During the study period  a total of 5645 severe cases of COVID-19 were recorded; these were matched to 50 096 controls. Of the severe cases  4495  80%  were not vaccinated  and of the controls  36 879  74%  were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated  389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May  2021  coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland  but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29  2021  the efficacy of two doses was 91%  95% CI 87–94  for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92%  88–95  for mRNA  Pfizer or Moderna  vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69%  95% CI 52–80  at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93%  88–96  at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant  or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5–6 months after second dose. However  the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease  including  but not limited to  booster doses  at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise. FUNDING: None.

METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study  cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults recruited between 23 May and 13 August 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age  sex  region  population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent activity-related exposures  past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection  and COVID-19 vaccination. FINDINGS: We did not find any differences in the settings and activities associated with Delta versus non-Delta infections and grouped them for subsequent analyses.

In those aged 40 years and older  having children attend daycare  aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.1-3.3   kindergarten  aOR:1.6; 95%CI:1.2-2.1   primary school  aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2-1.6  or middle school  aOR:1.3; 95%CI:1.2-1.6  were associated with increased risk of infection. We found strong protection against symptomatic Delta infection for those with prior infection whether it was recent  2-6 months   95%; 95%CI:90-97  or associated with one dose  85%; 95%CI:78-90  or two doses of mRNA vaccine  96%; 95%CI:87-99 . For those without past infection  protection was lower with two doses of mRNA vaccine  67%; 95%CI:63-71 . INTERPRETATION: In line with other observational studies  we find reduced vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Delta infections. The settings and activities at increased risk of infection indicate where efforts to reinforce individual and public health measures need to be concentrated.

Herein  we evaluated novel protein subunit vaccine formulations containing a resistin-trimerized spike antigen  SmT1. When combined with sulfated lactosyl archaeol  SLA  archaeosome adjuvant  formulations induced robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Antibodies had strong neutralizing activity  preventing viral spike binding and viral infection. In addition  the formulations were highly efficacious in a hamster challenge model reducing viral load and body weight loss even after a single vaccination. The antigen-specific antibodies generated by our vaccine formulations had stronger neutralizing activity than human convalescent plasma  neutralizing the spike proteins of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern. As such  our SmT1 antigen along with SLA archaeosome adjuvant comprise a promising platform for the development of efficacious protein subunit vaccine formulations for SARS-CoV-2.

A test-negative case-control study design using data from eight VISION Network sites§ examined vaccine effectiveness  VE  against COVID-19 emergency department urgent care  ED UC  visits and hospitalizations among U.S. adults aged ≥18 years at various time points after receipt of a second or third vaccine dose during two periods: Delta variant predominance and Omicron variant predominance  i.e.  periods when each variant accounted for ≥50% of sequenced isolates .¶ Persons categorized as having received 3 doses included those who received a third dose in a primary series or a booster dose after a 2 dose primary series  including the reduced-dosage Moderna booster . The VISION Network analyzed 241 204 ED UC encounters** and 93 408 hospitalizations across 10 states during August 26  2021-January 22  2022. VE after receipt of both 2 and 3 doses was lower during the Omicron-predominant than during the Delta-predominant period at all time points evaluated. During both periods  VE after receipt of a third dose was higher than that after a second dose; however  VE waned with increasing time since vaccination. During the Omicron period  VE against ED UC visits was 87% during the first 2 months after a third dose and decreased to 66% among those vaccinated 4-5 months earlier; VE against hospitalizations was 91% during the first 2 months following a third dose and decreased to 78% ≥4 months after a third dose. For both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods  VE was generally higher for protection against hospitalizations than against ED UC visits. All eligible persons should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations to best protect against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and ED UC visits.

The unprecedented velocity of spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a critical need for prevention strategies. Vaccines are recently being available and antiviral drugs have shown limited efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Thus  it is needed to know how to reduce the infectivity of the virus by different physicochemical conditions in order to prevent exposure to contaminated material. This work describes heating and irradiating UV-C light procedures to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to different three lineages. Results of physicochemical treatment showed no differences among viral lineages. Analytical conditions for efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 were determined.

However  the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I–IIa clinical trial 2  against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1 2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7  CAL.20C  P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants  respectively  as compared with WA1 2020 on day 71 after vaccination. Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants  respectively  as compared with WA1 2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses  including central and effector memory responses  were comparable among the WA1 2020  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants  but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Due to their high infectivity and morbidity  it has become clear that it is crucial to quickly and effectively detect these and other variants. Here  we report improved primers-probe sets for reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  for SARS-CoV-2 detection including a rapid  cost-effective  and direct RT-qPCR method for detection of the two variants of concern  Alpha  B.1.1.7 and Beta  B.1.351 . All the developed primers-probe sets were fully characterized  demonstrating sensitive and specific detection. These primer-probe sets were also successfully employed on wastewater samples aimed at detecting and even quantifying new variants in a geographical area  even prior to the reports by the medical testing. The novel primers-probe sets presented here will enable proper responses for pandemic containment  particularly considering the emergence of variants of concern.

Herein  we present an analysis of 6515 SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in Italy between 29 January 2020 and 1 March 2021 and show how different lineages emerged multiple times independently despite lockdown restrictions. Virus lineage B.1.177 became the dominant variant in November 2020  when cases peaked at 40 000 a day  but since January 2021 this is being replaced by the B.1.1.7 ‘variant of concern’. In addition  we report a sudden increase in another documented variant of concern—lineage P.1—from December 2020 onwards  most likely caused by a single introduction into Italy. We again highlight how international importations drive the emergence of new lineages and that genome sequencing should remain a top priority for ongoing surveillance in Italy.

Considering the growth of epidemic curve and the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in Brazil  the role of locally prevalent E484K and N501Y substitutions in contributing to the epidemiological outcomes is of public health interest for investigation. We developed a likelihood-based statistical framework to reconstruct reproduction numbers  estimate transmission advantage associated with different SARS-CoV-2 variants regarding the marking  identifying  484K and 501Y substitutions  including Alpha  Zeta  and Gamma variants  in Brazil  and explored the interactive effects of genetic activities on transmission advantage marked by these two mutations. We found a significant transmission advantage associated with the 484K 501Y variants  including P.1 or Gamma variants   which increased the infectivity significantly by 23%. In contrast and by comparison to Gamma variants  E484K or N501Y  including Alpha or Zeta variants  substitution alone appeared less likely to secure a concrete transmission advantage in Brazil. Our finding indicates that the combined impact of genetic activities on transmission advantage marked by 484K 501Y outperforms their independent contributions in Brazil  which implies an interactive effect in shaping the increase in the infectivity of COVID-19. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of how E484K and N501Y mutations and the complex genetic mutation activities marked by them in SARS-CoV-2 affect the transmissibility of COVID-19.

Here  we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  subunit vaccine candidate that simulates the natural structure of the spike  S  trimer glycoprotein. Immunization with the RBD-trimer induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses  and a high level of neutralizing antibodies was maintained for at least 4.5 months. Moreover  the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine effectively cross-neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant  B.1.351 . Of note  when the vaccine-induced antibodies dropped to a sufficiently low level  only one boost quickly activated the anamnestic immune response  conferring full protection against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques without typical histopathological changes in the lung tissues. These results demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-trimer vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and safe  providing long-lasting  broad  and significant immunity protection in nonhuman primates  thereby offering an optimal vaccination strategy against COVID-19.

The role of environmental surface contamination in viral transmission in within hospital wards is still debatable  especially considering the spread of new variants of the virus in the world. The present comprehensive study aims to investigate environmental surface contamination in different wards of a hospital as well as the efficacy of two common disinfectants for virus inactivation  and tries to produce an estimate of plastic residue pollution as an environmental side effect of the pandemic. With regard to environmental surface contamination  76 samples were taken from different wards of the hospital  from which 40 were positive. These samples were taken from contaminated environmental surfaces such as patient bed handles  the nursing station  toilet door handles  cell phones  patient toilet sinks  toilet bowls  and patient's pillows  which are regularly-touched surfaces and can pose a high risk for transmission of the virus. The number of positive samples also reveals that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on inanimate surfaces after disinfection by ethanol 70 % and sodium hypochlorite  0.001 % . The results correspond to the time that the VOC 202012 01  lineage B.1.1.7  had emerged in the hospital and this should be considered that this variant could possibly have different traits  characteristics  and level of persistence in the environment. The plastic waste as an environmental side effect of the pandemic was also investigated and it was confirmed that the amount of plastic residue for a single  RT  PCR confirmatory test for COVID-19 diagnosis is 821.778 g of plastic residue test. As a result  it is recommended that for improving plastic waste management programs  considering challenges such as minimizing plastic waste pollution  optimization of gas control technologies in incinerators  process redesign  reduction of single-use plastics and PPE  etc. Is of utmost importance.

Travel has been important factor for the easy spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants worldwide. India has also observed the importation of SARS-CoV-2 variants through international travelers. METHODS: In this study  we have collected the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 58 individuals with travel history from United Arab Emirates  UAE   East  West and South Africa  Qatar  Ukraine and Saudi Arabia arrived in India during February–March 2021. The clinical specimens were initially screened for SARS-CoV-2 using Real time RT-PCR. All the specimens were inoculated on to Vero CCL-81 cells for virus isolation. The viral isolates were further sequenced using Next-Generation Sequencing. RESULTS: All 58 cases were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using Real time RT-PCR. Four specimens showed progressive infectivity with fusion of the infected cells with neighboring cells leading to large mass of cells. Replication competent virus was confirmed from culture supernatant of the passage 2 using Real time RT-PCR. Two plaque purified SARS-CoV-2 isolates demonstrated high viral RNA load of 3.8–7.5 × 10 11  and 1.1–1.6 × 10 11  at passage 4 and 5 respectively. Nucleotide variations along with amino acid changes were also observed among these two isolates at passage 2–5. All four cases were male with no symptoms and co-morbidity. The sequence analysis has shown two different clusters  first cluster with nucleotide deletions in the ORF1ab and the spike  while second cluster with deletions in spike region. The viral isolates demonstrated 99.88–99.96% nucleotide identity with the representative sequences of Beta variant  B.1.351 . CONCLUSION: These findings suggest easier transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants with human mobility through international travel. The isolated Beta variant would be useful to determine the protective efficacy of the currently available and upcoming COVID-19 vaccines in India.

Animal models can be used to assess phenotypical changes in the absence of confounding factors that affect observed pathogenicity and transmissibility data in the human population. Here  we studied the pathogenicity of variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in rhesus macaques and compared it to a recent clade B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G substitution in the spike protein. The B.1.1.7 VOC behaved similarly to the D614G with respect to clinical disease  virus shedding and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in rhesus macaques that correlated with lower virus titers in the lungs  less severe histologic lung lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lungs. We observed differences in the local innate immune response to infection. In bronchoalveolar lavages  cytokines and chemokines were upregulated on day 4 in animals inoculated with D614G and B.1.1.7 but not in those inoculated with B.1.351. In nasal samples  we did not detect upregulation of cytokines and chemokines in D614G or B.1.351-inoculated animals. However  cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the noses of B.1.1.7-inoculated animals. Taken together  our comparative pathogenicity study suggests that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary pressure favors transmissibility and immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.

This study analyzed the viral genome sequencing data of 108 samples collected from patients infected with Omicron. First  we found that the enrichment efficiency of viral nucleic acids was reduced due to mutations in the region where the primers anneal to. Second  the Omicron variant possesses an excessive number of mutations compared to other variants circulating at the same time  62 vs. 45   especially in the Spike gene. Mutations in the Spike gene confer alterations in 32 amino acid residues  more than those observed in other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover  a large number of nonsynonymous mutations occur in the codons for the amino acid residues located on the surface of the Spike protein  which could potentially affect the replication  infectivity  and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Third  there are 53 mutations between the Omicron variant and its closest sequences available in public databases. Many of these mutations were rarely observed in public databases and had a low mutation rate. In addition  the linkage disequilibrium between these mutations was low  with a limited number of mutations  6  concurrently observed in the same genome  suggesting that the Omicron variant would be in a different evolutionary branch from the currently prevalent variants. To improve our ability to detect and track the source of new variants rapidly  it is imperative to further strengthen genomic surveillance and data sharing globally in a timely manner.

Therefore  we conducted a study to understand the putative reservoirs  transmission dynamics  and susceptibility patterns of SARS‐CoV‐2 in animals. Rhinolophus bats are presumed to be natural progenitors of SARS‐CoV‐2‐related viruses. Initially  pangolin was thought to be the source of spillover to humans  but they might be infected by human or other animal species. So  the virus spillover pathways to humans remain unknown. Human‐to‐animal transmission has been testified in pet  farmed  zoo and free‐ranging wild animals. Infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings like mink‐to‐mink and mink‐to‐cat transmission. Animal‐to‐human transmission is not a persistent pathway  while mink‐to‐human transmission continues to be illuminated. Multiple companions and captive wild animals were infected by an emerging alpha variant of concern  B.1.1.7 lineage  whereas Asiatic lions were infected by delta variant   B.1.617.2 . To date  multiple animal species – cat  ferrets  non‐human primates  hamsters and bats – showed high susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 in the experimental condition  while swine  poultry  cattle showed no susceptibility. The founding of SARS‐CoV‐2 in wild animal reservoirs can confront the control of the virus in humans and might carry a risk to the welfare and conservation of wildlife as well. We suggest vaccinating pets and captive animals to stop spillovers and spillback events. We recommend sustainable One Health surveillance at the animal–human–environmental interface to detect and prevent future epidemics and pandemics by Disease X.

Whether the increase in postvaccination infections during the summer of 2021 was caused by declining immunity over time  the emergence of the B.1.617.2  delta  variant  or both is unknown. METHODS: We extracted data regarding Covid-19–related vaccination and outcomes during a 9-month period  December 11  2020  to September 8  2021  for approximately 10.6 million North Carolina residents by linking data from the North Carolina Covid-19 Surveillance System and the Covid-19 Vaccine Management System. We used a Cox regression model to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2  Pfizer–BioNTech   mRNA-1273  Moderna   and Ad26.COV2.S  Johnson & Johnson–Janssen  vaccines in reducing the current risks of Covid-19  hospitalization  and death  as a function of time elapsed since vaccination. RESULTS: For the two-dose regimens of messenger RNA  mRNA  vaccines BNT162b2  30 μg per dose  and mRNA-1273  100 μg per dose   vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 94.5%  95% confidence interval [CI]  94.1 to 94.9  and 95.9%  95% CI  95.5 to 96.2   respectively  at 2 months after the first dose and decreased to 66.6%  95% CI  65.2 to 67.8  and 80.3%  95% CI  79.3 to 81.2   respectively  at 7 months. Among early recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273  effectiveness decreased by approximately 15 and 10 percentage points  respectively  from mid-June to mid-July  when the delta variant became dominant. For the one-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S  5×10 10  viral particles   effectiveness against Covid-19 was 74.8%  95% CI  72.5 to 76.9  at 1 month and decreased to 59.4%  95% CI  57.2 to 61.5  at 5 months. All three vaccines maintained better effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and death than in preventing infection over time  although the two mRNA vaccines provided higher levels of protection than Ad26.COV2.S. CONCLUSIONS: All three Covid-19 vaccines had durable effectiveness in reducing the risks of hospitalization and death. Waning protection against infection over time was due to both declining immunity and the emergence of the delta variant.

Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated  older adult residents at assisted living  personal care  and independent living communities. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 – April 1  2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. SETTING: and Population: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living  personal care  and independent living communities  who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. METHODS: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels  and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics  Pearson correlation coefficients  and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. RESULTS: All participants  N = 70  had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males  advanced age  current use of steroids  and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated  P < .001  with Beckman Coulter antibody levels  D614 G NT50  r s  = 0.91; B.1.1.7 [UK] NT50  r s  = 0.91 . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher functioning  healthier  residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However  protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity  which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living  personal care  and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies  but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes.

A total of 1 459 high quality samples were collected  sequenced  and analyzed in the state of Delaware  a location that offers a unique perspective on transmission given its proximity to large international airports on the east coast. Pangolin and Nextclade were used to classify these sequences into 16 unique clades and 88 lineages. A total of 411 samples belonging to the Alpha 20I 501Y.V1  B.1.1.7  strain of concern were identified  as well as one sample belonging to Beta 20H 501.V2  B.1.351   thirteen belonging to Epsilon 20C S:452R  B.1.427 B.1.429   two belonging to Delta 20A S:478K  B.1.617.2   and 15 belonging to Gamma 20J 501Y.V3  p.1 . A total of 2217 unique coding mutations were observed with an average of 17.7 coding mutations per genome. These data paired with continued sample collection and sequencing will give a deeper understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 strains within Delaware and its surrounding areas.

As recent variants have shown decreased reactivity to previously determined monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  or sera  monitoring the antigenicity change of circulating mutants is urgently needed for vaccine effectiveness. Currently  antigenic comparison is mainly carried out by immuno-binding assays. Yet  an online predicting system is highly desirable to complement the targeted experimental tests from the perspective of time and cost. Here  we provided a platform of SAS  Spike protein Antigenicity for SARS-CoV-2   enabling predicting the resistant effect of emerging variants and the dynamic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among circulating strains. When being compared to experimental results  SAS prediction obtained the consistency of 100% on 8 mAb-binding tests with detailed epitope covering mutational sites  and 80.3% on 223 anti-serum tests. Moreover  on the latest South Africa escaping strain  B.1.351   SAS predicted a significant resistance to reference strain at multiple mutated epitopes  agreeing well with the vaccine evaluation results. SAS enables auto-updating from GISAID  and the current version collects 867K GISAID strains  15.4K unique spike  S  variants  and 28 validated and predicted epitope regions that include 339 antigenic sites. Together with the targeted immune-binding experiments  SAS may be helpful to reduce the experimental searching space  indicate the emergence and expansion of antigenic variants  and suggest the dynamic coverage of representative mAbs vaccines among the latest circulating strains.

METHODS: We used a case–control  test-negative design to assess vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization  admission to an intensive care unit  ICU   the use of life-supporting interventions  mechanical ventilation  vasopressors  and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation   or death. Between July 1 and October 25  2021  we screened admission logs for eligible case patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full vaccination  two doses of BNT162b2  in case patients as compared with two hospital-based control groups: patients who had Covid-19–like symptoms but negative results on testing for SARS-CoV-2  test-negative  and patients who did not have Covid-19–like symptoms  syndrome-negative . RESULTS: A total of 445 case patients and 777 controls were enrolled. Overall  17 case patients  4%  and 282 controls  36%  had been fully vaccinated. Of the case patients  180  40%  were admitted to the ICU  and 127  29%  required life support; only 2 patients in the ICU had been fully vaccinated. The overall effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against hospitalization for Covid-19 was 94%  95% confidence interval [CI]  90 to 96 ; the effectiveness was 95%  95% CI  91 to 97  among test-negative controls and 94%  95% CI  89 to 96  among syndrome-negative controls. The effectiveness was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against Covid-19 resulting in the receipt of life support. All 7 deaths occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized adolescent patients  two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were highly effective against Covid-19–related hospitalization and ICU admission or the receipt of life support.

Les patients concernés étaient les patients de >80 ans ou les patients de <80 ans immunodéprimés  transplantation  chimiothérapie  traitement immunosuppresseur . Le risque d’émergence de variants potentiellement résistants à un monothérapie par anticorps monoclonal anti-Spike  en particulier les variants E484K  avait été pris en compte lors de l’ATUc. Cependant  le bénéfice potentiel de ces traitements chez les patients à haut risque a été considéré comme supérieur au risque. Ici nous décrivons 6 patients ayant reçu de ce traitement  leur évolution et l’émergence de mutations de résistance sous pression de sélection. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude unicentrique en centre hospitalier universitaire. Le bamlanivimab a été administré à une dose unique de 700mg en injection IV d’une heure chez 6 patients qui ont accepté d’utiliser le traitement dans le cadre de l’ATUc. Le suivi virologique des patients a consisté en un test RT-qPCR itératif réalisé le jour de la perfusion ou la veille  à J3±1  à J5±1  à J7±1 puis tous les 3jours jusqu’à ce que la PCR soit négative. La sélection de mutation de résistance a été vérifiée par séquençage du génome complet du SARS-CoV-2 chez tous les patients. Résultats Les six hommes traités avaient un âge médian de 65 ans  extrêmes 35-97   plus de 3 comorbidités à haut risque d’évolution vers une forme sévère et 5 étaient infectés par un variant UK  N501Y.V1  B.1.1.7 . Le traitement a été administré dans les 4jours suivant l’apparition des symptômes  médiane 2jours . Les 6 patients ont eu une évolution clinique favorable  deux ont eu besoin d’oxygène au débit maximal de 4 L min. Aucun patient n’a eu besoin d’oxygénothérapie haut débit  d’une ventilation non invasive ou d’une ventilation invasive. À J20 après l’administration  un seul présentait une PCR nasopharyngée négative et 5 présentaient l’apparition d’une mutation E484K à différents moments après l’administration  J6  J7  J12  J14 et J26 . Conclusion Chez ces patients à très haut risque d’évolution vers une forme sévère  la sélection de la mutation E484K après administration de bamlanivimab en monothérapie était très fréquente et bien plus importante qu’observée dans les premiers essais cliniques. Ceci peut être expliqué en partie par l’infection par un variant UK pour 5 6 patients décrits ici. L’émergence de résistance lors des bithérapies devra être suivi attentivement  notamment avec l’émergence des nouveaux variants.

We aimed to investigate whether isolates of wild-type P.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 can escape from neutralising antibodies generated by a polyclonal immune response. METHODS: We did an immunological study to assess the neutralising effects of antibodies on lineage P.1 and lineage B isolates of SARS-CoV-2  using plasma samples from patients previously infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Two specimens  P.1 28 and P.1 30  containing SARS-CoV-2 lineage P.1  as confirmed by viral genome sequencing  were obtained from nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected from patients in Manaus  Brazil  and compared against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B  SARS.CoV2 SP02.2020  recovered from a patient in Brazil in February  2020. Isolates were incubated with plasma samples from 21 blood donors who had previously had COVID-19 and from a total of 53 recipients of the chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine CoronaVac: 18 individuals after receipt of a single dose and an additional 20 individuals  38 in total  after receipt of two doses  collected 17–38 days after the most recent dose ; and 15 individuals who received two doses during the phase 3 trial of the vaccine  collected 134–230 days after the second dose . Antibody neutralisation of P.1 28  P.1 30  and B isolates by plasma samples were compared in terms of median virus neutralisation titre  VNT 50   defined as the reciprocal value of the sample dilution that showed 50% protection against cytopathic effects . FINDINGS: In terms of VNT 50   plasma from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an 8·6 times lower neutralising capacity against the P.1 isolates  median VNT 50  30 [IQR <20–45] for P.1 28 and 30 [<20–40] for P.1 30  than against the lineage B isolate  260 [160–400]   with a binominal model showing significant reductions in lineage P.1 isolates compared with the lineage B isolate  p≤0·0001 . Efficient neutralisation of P.1 isolates was not seen with plasma samples collected from individuals vaccinated with a first dose of CoronaVac 20–23 days earlier  VNT 50 s below the limit of detection [<20] for most plasma samples   a second dose 17–38 days earlier  median VNT 50  24 [IQR <20–25] for P.1 28 and 28 [<20–25] for P.1 30   or a second dose 134–260 days earlier  all VNT 50 s below limit of detection . Median VNT 50 s against the lineage B isolate were 20  IQR 20–30  after a first dose of CoronaVac 20–23 days earlier  75  <20–263  after a second dose 17–38 days earlier  and 20  <20–30  after a second dose 134–260 days earlier. In plasma collected 17–38 days after a second dose of CoronaVac  neutralising capacity against both P.1 isolates was significantly decreased  p=0·0051 for P.1 28 and p=0·0336 for P.1 30  compared with that against the lineage B isolate. All data were corroborated by results obtained through plaque reduction neutralisation tests. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 lineage P.1 might escape neutralisation by antibodies generated in response to polyclonal stimulation against previously circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. Continuous genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 combined with antibody neutralisation assays could help to guide national immunisation programmes.

B.1.1.7 has been detected in over 30 countries  including the United States. As of January 13  2021  approximately 76 cases of B.1.1.7 have been detected in 12 U.S. states.† Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants  1-3 . The modeled trajectory of this variant in the U.S. exhibits rapid growth in early 2021  becoming the predominant variant in March. Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission might threaten strained health care resources  require extended and more rigorous implementation of public health strategies  4   and increase the percentage of population immunity required for pandemic control. Taking measures to reduce transmission now can lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7 and allow critical time to increase vaccination coverage. Collectively  enhanced genomic surveillance combined with continued compliance with effective public health measures  including vaccination  physical distancing  use of masks  hand hygiene  and isolation and quarantine  will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . Strategic testing of persons without symptoms but at higher risk of infection  such as those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or who have frequent unavoidable contact with the public  provides another opportunity to limit ongoing spread.

One study has reported that the delta variant is 60% more transmissible than the alpha variant. As of August 2021  the delta variant has quickly become the dominant strain. Despite countries like the US  where most of the population is vaccinated  COVID-19 has made a resurgence in infections. Collectively  as a country  we ask: is it more deadly? What makes it more “contagious” or “transmissible”? This review article delves into the information we already know about the delta variant and how it compares with the other SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current vaccine companies like AstraZeneca  Pfizer BioNTech  and Moderna have reported that their vaccines can provide protection against this variant but with a slightly reduced efficacy. In this article  we do a comprehensive review and summary of the delta B.1.617.2 variant and what makes it more contagious.

However  their comparative effectiveness for a range of outcomes across diverse populations is unknown. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the electronic health records of U.S. veterans who received a first dose of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine between January 4 and May 14  2021  during a period marked by predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7  alpha  variant. We matched recipients of each vaccine in a 1:1 ratio according to their risk factors. Outcomes included documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  symptomatic Covid-19  hospitalization for Covid-19  admission to an intensive care unit  ICU  for Covid-19  and death from Covid-19. We estimated risks using the Kaplan–Meier estimator. To assess the influence of the B.1.617.2  delta  variant  we emulated a second target trial that involved veterans vaccinated between July 1 and September 20  2021. RESULTS: Each vaccine group included 219 842 persons. Over 24 weeks of follow-up in a period marked by alpha-variant predominance  the estimated risk of documented infection was 5.75 events per 1000 persons  95% confidence interval [CI]  5.39 to 6.23  in the BNT162b2 group and 4.52 events per 1000 persons  95% CI  4.17 to 4.84  in the mRNA-1273 group. The excess number of events per 1000 persons for BNT162b2 as compared with mRNA-1273 was 1.23  95% CI  0.72 to 1.81  for documented infection  0.44  95% CI  0.25 to 0.70  for symptomatic Covid-19  0.55  95% CI  0.36 to 0.83  for hospitalization for Covid-19  0.10  95% CI  0.00 to 0.26  for ICU admission for Covid-19  and 0.02  95% CI  −0.06 to 0.12  for death from Covid-19. The corresponding excess risk  BNT162b2 vs. mRNA-1273  of documented infection over 12 weeks of follow-up in a period marked by delta-variant predominance was 6.54 events per 1000 persons  95% CI  −2.58 to 11.82 . CONCLUSIONS: The 24-week risk of Covid-19 outcomes was low after vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2  although risks were lower with mRNA-1273 than with BNT162b2. This pattern was consistent across periods marked by alpha- and delta-variant predominance.  Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs and others.

High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work  we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here  the pseudotyped particles  PP  contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus  MLV  gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface  resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles  and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells  resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5 158 approved drugs and drug candidates  our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven  six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally  particles pseudotyped with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.

Here  we describe the emergence of a new variant  with the index case returning from travel in Cameroon. For 13 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients living in the same geographical area of southeastern France  a qPCR test for screening variant-associated mutations showed an atypical combination. The genome sequences were obtained by next-generation sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies on GridION instruments within about 8 h. Analysis revealed 46 nucleotide substitutions and 37 deletions  resulting in 30 amino acid substitutions and 12 deletions. Fourteen of the amino acid substitutions  including N501Y and E484K  and nine deletions are located in the spike protein. This genotype pattern led to the establishment of a new Pangolin lineage  named B.1.640.2  that is a phylogenetic sister group to the old B.1.640 lineage  which has now been renamed B.1.640.1. The lineages differ by 25 nucleotide substitutions and 33 deletions. The combination of mutations in these isolates and their phylogenetic position indicate  based on our previous definition  that they represent a new variant  which we have named “IHU”. These data are a further example of the unpredictability of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants  and of their possible introduction into a given geographical area from abroad.

This is likely a result of combination of immunodeficiency conferred by the disease and the therapeutics. The immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccines in patients with exposure to CD19 directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor  CAR -T cell therapy is not established. CD19 CAR-T cell therapies cause B-cell aplasia  which in turn can affect humoral immune response against novel antigens. Herein  we present results from our prospectively conducted clinical study to evaluate immune responses against mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with lymphoma who have received CD19 directed CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: All patients and healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective clinical study evaluating immune responses against commercial COVID-19 RNA vaccines in patients with hematologic malignancies. Plasma samples were generated from heparinized peripheral blood of 4 heathy controls  HCs  receiving the same vaccines and 19 B cell lymphoma patients treated with CD19 CAR- T cells. Samples from ~4 weeks post second dose of the vaccine  d56  were available for 14 CAR-T patients  for 5 CAR-T patients samples were available from ~4 weeks after the first dose  d28 . Plasma samples were analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  using different full-length recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins and control proteins. Neutralizing activity was measured using the cPass Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit  GenScript Biotech . Results: Results from 4 healthy controls and 19 patients  12 males and 7 females  with lymphoma are reported. Median age for the lymphoma patients is 65 years. Eleven patients had large B cell lymphoma  5 had follicular lymphoma and 3 had mantle cell lymphoma as primary diagnoses. Seventeen patients had advance stage disease  III IV stage  and had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. All patients received CD19 directed CAR-T cell therapy. Ten patients received Moderna vaccine and 9 received Pfizer vaccine. Median time between CAR-T infusion and first COVID-19 vaccine was 258 days. While the peripheral blood plasma from 3 4 HCs already showed substantial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity at ~4 weeks after the first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine  none of the 5 CD19 CAR-T patients analyzed evidenced any antibody-mediated neutralizing activity in their blood at the same point in time  Figure 1A . Around 4 weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine  all 4 HCs tested evidenced complete or almost complete neutralizing activity  Figure 1B . In marked contrast  only 1 out of 14 CAR-T patients analyzed evidenced any relevant antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in their blood  Figure 1B . Interestingly  when we asked whether a globally insufficient antibody-mediated immunity was the underlying cause of the lack of a response to the COVID-19 vaccine in our CAR-T patients  we found that that was clearly not the case since anti-Flu  -TT  and -EBV responses were equivalent to the ones observed in HCs  Figure 2A . However  while at ~4 weeks post second dose of the vaccine the HCs showed marked antibody titers against all the viral spike proteins including their “delta” variants  Figure 2B   that was not the case for our CAR-T patients. The vast majority of our CAR-T patients did not evidence IgG antibody responses against any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins analyzed such as S1  S1 delta  RBD  RBD delta  or S2  Figure 2B . Conclusion: In this prospectively conducted clinical study  18 of 19 patients with lymphoma who have received CD19 CAR-T therapy had poor immunogenicity against mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines as measured by neutralization assays and antibody titers. The antibody titers against B.1.617.2  delta variant  S1 and RBD protein  were also demonstrably poor. The antibody response to common pathogens  flu  EBV  TT  were preserved  suggesting impaired immune response against novel antigens. Long-term follow-up of this study is ongoing.

doi:10.1038/s41541-021-00390-9,An alphavirus replicon-based vaccine expressing a stabilized Spike antigen induces protective immunity and prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between cats,doi:10.1038/s41541-021-00390-9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34671047/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-021-00390-9,pubmed:34671047,pmc:PMC8528862,NPJ Vaccines,2021,An alphavirus replicon-based vaccine expressing a stabilized Spike antigen induces protective immunity and prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between cats,Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic concerns were raised regarding infection of new animal hosts and the effect on viral epidemiology. Infection of other animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease  allowing further mutations  and bares the risk for the establishment of a non-human reservoir. Cats were the first reported animals susceptible to natural and experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Given the concerns these findings raised  and the close contact between humans and cats  we aimed to develop a vaccine candidate that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and in addition to prevent spread among cats. Here we report that a Replicon Particle  RP  vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus  known to be safe and efficacious in a variety of animal species  could induce neutralizing antibody responses in guinea pigs and cats. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen was critical in developing a strong neutralizing antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce high neutralizing antibody responses  effective also against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. Interestingly  in contrast to control animals  the infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Correspondingly  the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit the virus. The results show that the RP vaccine induces protective immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. These data suggest that this RP vaccine could be a multi-species vaccine useful to prevent infection and spread to and between animals should that approach be required.

Because new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging rapidly  as exemplified by the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 lineages  it is critical to understand whether antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or current vaccines remain effective. In this study  we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated spike pseudotypes based on divergence from SARS-CoV and then compare neutralization of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotype and individual mutations. Spike-specific monoclonal antibody neutralization is reduced dramatically; in contrast  polyclonal antibodies from individuals infected in early 2020 remain active against most mutated spike pseudotypes  but potency is reduced in a minority of samples. This work highlights that changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their effect on vaccine efficacy.

These VoC are associated with higher transmissibility rates and in some cases  increased mortality. In this work we present a national wastewater survey of the distribution of three SARS-CoV-2 mutations found in the B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   and P.1  gamma  VoC  namely the S-gene 69–70 deletion  N501Y mutation  and N-gene D3L. RT-qPCR allelic discrimination assays were sufficiently sensitive and specific for detection and relative quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater to allow for rapid population-level screening and surveillance. We tested 261 samples collected from 5 Canadian cities  Vancouver  Edmonton  Toronto  Montreal  and Halifax  and 6 communities in the Northwest Territories from February 16th to March 28th  2021. VoC were not detected in the Territorial communities  suggesting the absence of VoC SARS-CoV-2 cases in those communities. Percentage of variant remained low throughout the study period in the majority of the sites tested  however the Toronto sites showed a marked increase from ~25% to ~75% over the study period. The results of this study highlight the utility of population level molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VoC using wastewater. Wastewater monitoring for VoC can be a powerful tool in informing public health responses  including monitoring trends independent of clinical surveillance and providing early warning to communities.

The recent emergence of novel lineages carrying several mutations in the spike protein has raised additional public health concerns worldwide. The present study describes the temporal spreading and evolution of SARS‐CoV2 in the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Brazil  highlighting the fast dissemination of the two major concerning variants  P.1 and P.2 . A total of 2507 SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐genome sequences  WGSs  with available information from the country  Brazil  and sampling date  July 2020–February 2021   were obtained and the frequencies of the lineages were evaluated in the period of the growing second pandemic wave. The results demonstrated the increasing prevalence of P.1 and P.2 lineages in the period evaluated. P.2 lineage was first detected in the middle of 2020  but a high increase occurred only in the last trimester of this same year and the spreading to all Brazilian regions. P.1 lineage emerged even later  first in the North region in December 2020 and really fast dissemination to all other Brazilian regions in January and February 2021. All SARS‐CoV‐2 WGSs of P.1 and P.2 were further separately evaluated with a Bayesian approach. The rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were statistically higher in P.1 than P.2  p < 0.01 . The phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that P.2 gradually spread in all the country from September 2020 to January 2021  while P.1 disseminated even faster from December 2020 to February 2021. Skyline plots of both lineages demonstrated a slight rise in the spreading for P.2 and exponential growth for P.1. In conclusion  these data demonstrated that the P.1  recently renamed as Gamma  and P.2 lineages have predominated in the second pandemic wave due to the very high spreading across all geographic regions in Brazil at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021.

Being more transmissible than the original virus  the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage  named the Delta variant  swept through the world in 2021. The mutations in the Delta’s spike protein shift the protein towards a net positive electrostatic potential. To understand the key molecular drivers of the Delta infection  we investigate the cellular uptake of the Delta spike protein and Delta spike-bearing SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Specific in vitro modification of ACE2 and syndecan expression enabled us to demonstrate that syndecan-4  the syndecan isoform abundant in the lung  enhances the transmission of the Delta variant by attaching its mutated spike glycoprotein and facilitating its cellular entry. Compared to the wild-type spike  the Delta one shows a higher affinity towards heparan sulfate proteoglycans than towards ACE2. In addition to attachment to the polyanionic heparan sulfate chains  the Delta spike’s molecular interactions with syndecan-4 also involve syndecan-4’s cell-binding domain that mediates cell-to-cell adhesion. Regardless of the complexity of these interactions  exogenously added heparin blocks Delta’s cellular entry as efficiently as syndecan-4 knockdown. Therefore  a profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Delta infections enables the development of molecularly targeted yet simple strategies to reduce the Delta variant’s spread.

We investigated risk factors and outcomes for infection with the delta variant among vaccinated hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis who received two doses of the BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  vaccine were analysed according to having developed COVID-19  study group  or not  control group   in a retrospective  observational  comparative study. We compared risk-factors for developing breakthrough COVID-19 and assessed clinical outcomes  including 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared to 91 controls without infection. Breakthrough infection was associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment  hematological malignancies  and low antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. All COVID-19 cases occurred at least 5 months after vaccination  and most were caused by the B.1.617.2 variant  at least 23 24 cases . COVID-19 was categorized as severe or critical disease in 11 24 patients  46%   and 54% required hospitalization and COVID-19-directed treatment. The source of infection was nosocomial in 6 24 cases  25%   and healthcare-related in 3 24  12.5% . Mortality rate was 21%. Overall mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed COVID-19 than in controls  odds ratio for all-cause mortality 7.6  95% CI 1.4–41  p = 0.002 . CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough COVID-19 with the B.1.617.2 variant can occur in vaccinated hemodialysis patients and is associated with immunosuppression and weaker humoral response to vaccination. Infections may be nosocomial and result in significant morbidity and mortality.

Rapid tests  such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR   play an important role in monitoring COVID-19 infection and controlling its spread. However  the changes in the genotypes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants may result in decreased sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assay and it is necessary to monitor the mutations in primers and probes of SARS-CoV-2 detection over time. METHODS: We developed two rRT-PCR assays to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp  and nucleocapsid  N  genes of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated these assays together with our previously published assays targeting the ORF1ab and N genes for the detection and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern  VOCs . In addition  we also developed two rRT-PCR assays  S484K and S501Y  targeting the spike gene  which when combined with the open reading frames  ORF 1ab assay  respectively  to form duplex rRT-PCR assays  were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  lineages B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 . RESULTS: Using a SARS-CoV-2 stock with predetermined genomic copies as a standard  the detection limit of both assays targeting RdRp and N was five copies reaction. Furthermore  no cross-reactions with six others human CoVs  229E  OC43  NL63  HKU1  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  were observed using these assays. In addition  the S484K and S501Y assays were combined with the ORF1ab assay  respectively.

Besides nucleic acid-based test systems and point-of-care  POCT  antigen  Ag  tests  quantitative  laboratory-based nucleocapsid Ag tests for SARS-CoV-2 have recently been launched. Here  we evaluated four commercial Ag tests on automated platforms and one POCT to detect SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated PCR-positive  n = 107  and PCR-negative  n = 303  respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients at the end of the second pandemic wave in Germany  February–March 2021  as well as clinical isolates EU1  B.1.117   variant of concern  VOC  Alpha  B.1.1.7  or Beta  B.1.351   which had been expanded in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The specificities of automated SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests ranged between 97.0 and 99.7%  Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag  Fujirebio : 97.03%  Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Ag  Roche Diagnostics : 97.69%; LIAISON ®  SARS-CoV-2 Ag  Diasorin  and SARS-CoV-2 Ag ELISA  Euroimmun : 99.67% . In this study cohort of hospitalized patients  the clinical sensitivities of tests were low  ranging from 17.76 to 52.34%  and analytical sensitivities ranged from 420 000 to 25 000 000 Geq ml. In comparison  the detection limit of the Roche Rapid Ag Test  RAT  was 9 300 000 Geq ml  detecting 23.58% of respiratory samples. Receiver-operating-characteristics  ROCs  and Youden’s index analyses were performed to further characterize the assays’ overall performance and determine optimal assay cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity. VOCs carrying up to four amino acid mutations in nucleocapsid were detected by all five assays with characteristics comparable to non-VOCs. In summary  automated  quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests show variable performance and are not necessarily superior to a standard POCT. The efficacy of any alternative testing strategies to complement nucleic acid-based assays must be carefully evaluated by independent laboratories prior to widespread implementation.

Despite first successes in vaccine development and approval  no antiviral treatment is available for COVID-19 patients. The success is further tarnished by the emergence and spreading of mutation variants of SARS-CoV-2  for which some vaccines have lower efficacy. This highlights the urgent need for antiviral therapies even more. This article describes how the genome-scale metabolic model  GEM  of the host-virus interaction of human alveolar macrophages and SARS-CoV-2 was refined by incorporating the latest information about the virus’s structural proteins and the mutant variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.28  B.1.427 B.1.429  and B.1.617. We confirmed the initially identified guanylate kinase as a potential antiviral target with this refined model and identified further potential targets from the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The model was further extended by incorporating the virus’ lipid requirements. This opened new perspectives for potential antiviral targets in the altered lipid metabolism. Especially the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis seems to play a pivotal role in viral replication. The guanylate kinase is even a robust target in all investigated mutation variants currently spreading worldwide. These new insights can guide laboratory experiments for the validation of identified potential antiviral targets. Only the combination of vaccines and antiviral therapies will effectively defeat this ongoing pandemic.

In this study  23 whole genomes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS‐CoV‐2  from patients who were hospitalized during January to March 2020 were analyzed  along with their travel histories. Six lineages were identified including A  A6  B  B.1  B.1.8 and B.58; lineage A.6 was dominant. Seven patients were from China who travelled to Thailand in January and early of February  five of them were infected with B lineage virus  the other two cases were infected with different lineages including A and A.6. These findings represent clear evidence of the early introduction of diverse SARS‐CoV‐2 clades in Thailand. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This preventive measure is an effective source control technique to curb the spread of COVID-19 and other similar diseases. The virus responsible for causing COVID-19 has undergone several mutations in the recent past  including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and N501Y  B.1.617  with a higher infectious rate. These viruses' variants are mainly responsible for the recent spike in COVID-19 cases and associated steep rise in mortality rate worldwide. Under these circumstances  the Center for Disease Control  CDC  and health experts recommend double masking  which mainly includes a surgical mask and a cotton mask for the general public. This combination provides an additional layer of protection and masks fitment to minimize the leakage of droplets expelled during coughing  sneezing  talking  and breathing. This leakage may cause airborne transmission of the virus. In the present study  we report a systematic quantitative unsteady pressure measurement supplement with flow visualization to quantify the effectiveness of a single and double mask. We have also evaluated double masking consisting of a surgical mask and an N-95 mask used by medical professionals. A simple knot improves the surgical mask fitment significantly  and hence  the leakage of droplets is minimized. The leakage of the droplets was reduced to a large extent by using a double mask combination of a two-layer cotton mask over the surgical mask with a knot. The double mask combination of surgical + N-95 and two-layer cotton + N-95 masks showed the most promising results  and no leakage of the droplets is observed in the forward direction. A double mask combination of surgical and N-95 mask offers 8.6% and 5.6% lower mean and peak pressures compared to surgical  and cotton mask. The best results are observed with cotton and N-95 masks with 54.6% and 23% lower mean and peak pressures than surgical and cotton masks; hence  this combination will offer more comfort to the wearer.

This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However  there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations  and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which  in turn  is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study  the GBPM analysis  originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features  has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike ACE2 molecular recognition  using four different crystallographic structures. Then  we intersected these structural results with the current mutational status  based on more than 295 000 sequenced cases  in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 20 distinct patients: S477N  N439K  N501Y  Y453F  E484K  K417N  S477I and G476S. Among these  mutation N501Y in particular is one of the events characterizing SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7  which has recently risen in frequency in Europe. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P  E37K  M82I  E329G and G352V. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

Rapid detection of these variants is essential since their dissemination can impact transmission rates  diagnostic procedures  disease severity  response to vaccines or patient management. Sanger sequencing has been used as the preferred approach for variant detection among circulating human immunodeficiency and measles virus genotypes. Using primers to amplify a fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encoding part of the Spike protein  we showed that Sanger sequencing allowed us to rapidly detect the introduction and spread of three distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants in two major Brazilian cities. In both cities  after the predominance of variants closely related to the virus first identified in China  the emergence of the P.2 variant was quickly followed by the detection of the P1 variant  which became dominant in less than one month after it was first detected.

Over 500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected since December 2020  but its local establishment and pathways of spread are relatively unknown. Using travel  genomic  and diagnostic testing data  we highlight the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US and locations of possible underreporting of B.1.1.7 cases. New York  which receives the most international travel from the UK  is likely one of the key hubs for introductions and domestic spread. Finally  we provide evidence for increased community transmission in several states. Thus  genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.

A new SARS-CoV-2 strain is expected to emerge in late 2020  including B.1.1.7. The high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 has raised public health concerns in several countries. Hence  in this study  we assessed the sequencing of SARS-COV2 to reveals the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant  B 1.1.7  in Egypt. We found that the viral transmission of the alpha variant is expanding. Moreover  based on hospitalizations and case fatality rates  there is a potential for increasing severity. There was no effect on susceptibility to Emergency Use Authorization monoclonal antibody treatments. However  there was minimal impact on neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera. Samples have been clustered into the 20D sub clade for the majority of them. The eight samples shown in our study are considered the first recorded samples with the Alpha variant in Egypt. Therefore  The Egyptian government  represented by the Ministry of Health  must take all measures to examine the compatibility of the currently used vaccines with this new strain and the feasibility of the treatment protocol presently used with such strains developed in the Arab Republic of Egypt.

Genetic variation and selective pressures lead to the accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  within the viral genome that may affect virulence  transmission rate  viral recognition and the efficacy of prophylactic and interventional measures. To address these concerns at the genomic level  we assessed the phylogeny and SNPs of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant population collected to date in Iran in relation to globally reported variants. Phylogenetic analysis of mutant strains revealed the occurrence of the variants known as B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.525  Eta   and B.1.617  Delta  that appear to have delineated independently in Iran. SNP analysis of the Iranian sequences revealed that the mutations were predominantly positioned within the S protein-coding region  with most SNPs localizing to the S1 subunit. Seventeen S1-localizing SNPs occurred in the RNA binding domain that interacts with ACE2 of the host cell. Importantly  many of these SNPs are predicted to influence the binding of antibodies and anti-viral therapeutics  indicating that the adaptive host response appears to be imposing a selective pressure that is driving the evolution of the virus in this closed population through enhancing virulence. The SNPs detected within these mutant cohorts are addressed with respect to current prophylactic measures and therapeutic interventions.

Early detection and evaluation of their associated risk of spreading within the population are pivotal. METHODS: Between April 2020 and February 2021  the UK Lighthouse Labs Network at Alderley Park tested more than eight million nose and throat swab samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2  via PCR. The assay targeted three genomic regions of the virus: N  Orf1ab and S. Whole-genome next-generation sequencing was used to confirm positive PCR results. Positive results were mapped using the postal district origin of samples to allow real-time tracking of the spread of a new variant through the UK. FINDINGS: In mid-November 2020  the assay identified an increasing number of S gene negative  N and Orf1ab positive samples. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the loss of S gene detection was due to the appearance of a SARS-CoV-2 lineage  B.1.1.7  designated as Variant of concern  VOC  202012 01. By the beginning of January 2021  the new SARS-CoV-2 VOC comprised 70% of daily positive samples tested at Alderley Park and ∼98% by the end of February 2021. INTERPRETATION: The timeline view identified the rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant across England during the first three weeks of December. Coupling high-throughput diagnostics and molecular surveillance was pivotal to the early detection of the spread of this variant. The availability of real-time tracking of an emerging variant is an important new tool to inform decision-making authorities for risk mitigation. In a respiratory pandemic  a tool for the timely response to the emergence and spread of a novel variant is vital  even more so when a variant is associated with the enhanced transmission  as has occurred with VOC 202012 01.

The B.1.1.7 variant has been associated with increased mortality and transmission risk. Furthermore  cluster and possible co-infection cases could occur in the next influenza season or COVID-19 pandemic wave  warranting efficient diagnosis and treatment decision making. Here  we aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR developed on the LabTurbo AIO 48 open system. We performed a multicenter study to evaluate the performance and analytical sensitivity of the LabTurbo AIO 48 system for SARS-CoV-2  influenza A B  and respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  using 652 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples from patients. The LabTurbo AIO 48 system demonstrated a sensitivity of 9.4 copies per PCR for N2 of SARS-CoV-2; 24 copies per PCR for M of influenza A and B; and 24 copies per PCR for N of RSV. The assay presented consistent performance in the multicenter study. The multiplex RT-PCR applied on the LabTurbo AIO 48 open platform provided highly sensitive  robust  and accurate results and enabled high-throughput detection of B.1.1.7  influenza A B  and RSV with short turnaround times. Therefore  this automated molecular diagnostic assay could enable streamlined testing if COVID-19 becomes a seasonal disease.

In Costa Rica during the year 2020  a predominant genotype carrying the mutation T1117I in the spike  S:T1117I  was previously identified. To investigate the possible effects of this mutation on the function of the spike  i.e. the biology of the virus  different bioinformatic pipelines based on phylogeny  natural selection  and co-evolutionary models  molecular docking  and epitopes prediction were implemented. Results of the phylogeny of sequences carrying the S:T1117I worldwide showed a polyphyletic group  with the emergence of local lineages. In Costa Rica  the mutation is found in the lineage B.1.1.389 and it is suggested to be a product of positive adaptive selection. Different changes in the function of the spike protein and more stable interaction with a ligand  nelfinavir drug  were found. Only one epitope out 742 in the spike was affected by the mutation  with some different properties  but suggesting scarce changes in the immune response and no influence on the vaccine effectiveness. Jointly  these results suggest a partial benefit of the mutation for the spread of the virus with this genotype during the year 2020 in Costa Rica  although possibly not strong enough with the introduction of new lineages during early 2021 which became predominant later. In addition  the bioinformatic analyses used here can be applied as an in silico strategy to eventually study other mutations of interest for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other pathogens.

Reinfections were postulated as a partial explanation for the second surge. However  accurate calculation of reinfection rates is difficult when stringent criteria as two time-separated RT-PCR tests and or genome sequencing are required. To estimate the proportion of reinfections caused by Gamma during the second wave in Manaus and the protection conferred by previous infection  we identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody boosting in repeat blood donors as a mean to infer reinfection. METHODS: We tested serial blood samples from unvaccinated repeat blood donors in Manaus for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using two assays that display waning in early convalescence  enabling the detection of reinfection-induced boosting. Donors were required to have three or more donations  being at least one during each epidemic wave. We propose a strict serological definition of reinfection  reactivity boosting following waning like a V-shaped curve in both assays or three spaced boostings   probable  two separate boosting events  and possible  reinfection detected by only one assay  reinfections. The serial samples were used to divide donors into six groups defined based on the inferred sequence of infection and reinfection with non-Gamma and Gamma variants. RESULTS: From 3655 repeat blood donors  238 met all inclusion criteria  and 223 had enough residual sample volume to perform both serological assays. We found 13.6%  95% CI 7.0–24.5%  of all presumed Gamma infections that were observed in 2021 were reinfections. If we also include cases of probable or possible reinfections  these percentages increase respectively to 22.7%  95% CI 14.3–34.2%  and 39.3%  95% CI 29.5–50.0% . Previous infection conferred a protection against reinfection of 85.3%  95% CI 71.3–92.7%   decreasing to respectively 72.5%  95% CI 54.7–83.6%  and 39.5%  95% CI 14.1–57.8%  if probable and possible reinfections are included. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection by Gamma is common and may play a significant role in epidemics where Gamma is prevalent  highlighting the continued threat variants of concern pose even to settings previously hit by substantial epidemics.

However  the serum antibody levels in vaccinated individuals gradually decrease over time  while SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing an evolution toward more transmissible variants  such as B.1.617.2  ultimately increasing the risk of breakthrough infections and further virus spread. This cross-sectional online study of adult Poles  n = 2427  was conducted in September 2021  before a general recommendation to administer a booster COVID-19 vaccine dose in Poland was issued  to assess the attitude of individuals who completed the current vaccination regime toward a potential booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and identify potential factors that may influence it. Overall  71% of participants declared willingness to receive a booster COVID-19 dose  with a low median level of fear of receiving it of 1.0  measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale   which was increased particularly in those having a worse experience  in terms of severity of side effects and associated fear  with past COVID-19 vaccination. The lowest frequency of willingness to receive a booster dose  26.7%  was seen in the group previously vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S. The majority of individuals vaccinated previously with mRNA vaccines wished to receive the same vaccine  while in the case of AZD1222  such accordance was observed only in 9.1%. The main reasons against accepting a booster COVID-19 dose included the side effects experienced after previous doses  the opinion that further vaccination is unnecessary  and safety uncertainties. Women  older individuals  ≥50 years   subjects with obesity  chronic diseases  and pre-vaccination and post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections  and those with a history of vaccination against influenza were significantly more frequently willing to receive a booster COVID-19 dose. Moreover  the majority of immunosuppressed individuals  88%  were willing to receive an additional dose. The results emphasize some hesitancy toward potential further COVID-19 vaccination in the studied group of Poles and indicate the main groups to be targeted with effective science communication regarding the booster doses.

The SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program among migrants arriving to Sicily via the Mediterranean Sea  made by the combination of clinical examination and molecular testing  has been integrated by full-genome sequencing strains using the NGS technology from the last week of February. To date  more than one hundred full-genome strains have been sequenced and 8 different lineages have been identified mostly belonging to the lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.525. As global access to COVID-19 vaccines should be ensured  the need to provide more detailed information to inform policies and to drive the possible re-engineering of vaccines needed to deal with the challenge of new and future variants should be highlighted.

However  it is unknown if antibodies elicited by infection with these variants target the same or different regions of the viral spike as antibodies elicited by earlier viral isolates. Here we compare the specificities of polyclonal antibodies produced by humans infected with early 2020 isolates versus the B.1.351 variant of concern  also known as Beta or 20H 501Y.V2   which contains mutations in multiple key spike epitopes. The serum neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by infection with both early 2020 viruses and B.1.351 is heavily focused on the spike receptor-binding domain  RBD . However  within the RBD  B.1.351-elicited antibodies are more focused on the “class 3” epitope spanning sites 443 to 452  and neutralization by these antibodies is notably less affected by mutations at residue 484. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 variants can elicit polyclonal antibodies with different immunodominance hierarchies.

So far  monoclonal antibodies and drug repositioning are the main methods for drug development  and this effort was partially successful. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has been reported in many parts of the world  and the main concern is whether the current vaccines and therapeutics are still effective against these variant viruses. Viral entry and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp  are the main targets of current drug development; therefore  the inhibitory effects of transmembrane serine protease 2  TMPRSS2  and RdRp inhibitors were compared among the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate  lineage A  and the two recent variants  lineage B.1.1.7 and lineage B.1.351  identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa  respectively. Our in vitro analysis of viral replication showed that the drugs targeting TMPRSS2 and RdRp are equally effective against the two variants of concern. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented global problems in both public health and human society. While some vaccines and monoclonal antibodies were successfully developed very quickly and are currently being used  numerous variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 are emerging and threatening the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. In order to respond to this challenge  we assessed antiviral efficacy of small-molecule inhibitors that are being developed for treatment of COVID-19 and found that they are still very effective against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Since most small-molecule inhibitors target viral or host factors other than the mutated sequence of the viral spike protein  they are expected to be potent control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.

We engineered a novel vaccine based on a chimeric human adenovirus 5  hAdV5  vector. The vaccine  named CoroVaxG.3  is based on three pillars:  i  high expression of Spike to enhance its immunodominance by using a potent promoter and an mRNA stabilizer;  ii  enhanced infection of muscle and dendritic cells by replacing the fiber knob domain of hAdV5 by hAdV3;  iii  use of Spike stabilized in a prefusion conformation. The transduction with CoroVaxG.3-expressing Spike  D614G  dramatically enhanced the Spike expression in human muscle cells  monocytes and dendritic cells compared to CoroVaxG.5 that expressed the native fiber knob domain. A single dose of CoroVaxG.3 induced a potent humoral immunity with a balanced Th1 Th2 ratio and potent T-cell immunity  both lasting for at least 5 months. Sera from CoroVaxG.3-vaccinated mice was able to neutralize pseudoviruses expressing B.1  wild type D614G   B.1.117  alpha   P.1  gamma  and B.1.617.2  delta  Spikes  as well as an authentic P.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Neutralizing antibodies did not wane even after 5 months  making this kind of vaccine a likely candidate to enter clinical trials.

Characteristics of COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Cases in Minnesota  2021,BACKGROUND: Over 600 000 COVID-19 cases  including >7000 deaths reported to MN Dept of Health  MDH  by June 1  2021. Clinical trials demonstrated high effectiveness of COVID vaccines. We assessed COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated residents [vaccine breakthrough  VB  cases]. METHODS: COVID-19 VB cases were MN residents with completed COVID-19 vaccination series ≥14 days prior to symptom onset or positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification or antigen test. COVID-19 cases were reported to MDH and COVID-19 vaccinations reported to the MN Immunization Information Connection  MIIC . COVID-19 cases were matched to MIIC to identify VB and interviewed; medical records of hospitalized cases were reviewed. Available VB case specimens underwent whole genome sequencing  WGS  at MDH or collaborating lab. RESULTS: Jan 19 – June 1  2021  2765 VB cases were reported among >2.45 million fully vaccinated residents and 147 445 COVID-19 cases. VB case median  MED  age was 52 y  IQR 38  68   83% white  65% female; MED age of fully vaccinated was 55 y  IQR 30  68   77% white  54% female. Of VB cases  273  10%  were hospitalized and 32  1%  died  MED age 74 y; IQR 66  85 . 2212  80%  VB cases were interviewed; 60% reported symptoms; most common were fatigue  53%   rhinorrhea  49%   cough  42%   headache  41% . 35% reported a comorbidity. Of hospitalized VB cases  120 had completed record reviews. 64 were admitted for COVID-19 related illness  MED age 74 y  IQR:65  83  including 27 admitted to ICU  MED age 71 y  IQR: 65  83 . 90%  108  reported a comorbidity  most common being chronic metabolic conditions  46%   obesity  45%   renal disease  31%  and chronic lung disease  26% ; 27 were immunocompromised  not mutually exclusive   including immunosuppressive therapy  15   hematological malignancy  9   other cancer  11   and organ transplant recipients  8 . Of 604 VB case specimens  79% were B.1.1.7  9% B.1.427 429  3% P.1  and 2% B.1.351; lineage distribution was similar to overall 24 157 MN SARS-CoV2 WGS data. CONCLUSION: Identified VB cases were 0.1% of those vaccinated and < 2% of total cases reported in the time period. COVID-19 vaccines are an important tool in preventing COVID-19. Additional surveillance  including WGS and case characteristics will be useful to monitor VB. DISCLOSURES: Ruth Lynfield  MD  Nothing to disclose

In this study  we evaluated the neutralizing activity against the viral variants that emerged in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7   Brazil  P.1   and South Africa  B.1.351  in human serum samples from hospitalized patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave in Italy in 2020. Of the patients studied  59.5% showed a decrease  ≥2 fold  in neutralizing antibody titer against B.1.1.7  83.3% against P.1  and 90.5% against B.1.351 with respect to the original strain. The reduction in antibody titers against all analyzed variants  and in particular P.1 and B.1.351  suggests that previous symptomatic infection might be not fully protective against exposure to SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying a set of relevant spike mutations.

The analysis is presented by age group  comparing at each stage the percentage of the corresponding group with its representation in the society. The time period analyzed covers 1 March 2020 to 1 April 2021  and includes the influence of the B.1.1.7 lineage of COVID-19 which in April 2021 was behind 90% of new cases in Galicia. It is numerically shown how the pandemic affects the age groups 80+  70+ and 60+  and therefore we give information about how the vaccination process could be scheduled and hints at why the pandemic had different effects in different territories.

A recent VOC  Omicron  B.1.1.529   which obtains a large number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein  has risen to intense scientific and public attention. Here we studied the binding properties between the human receptor ACE2  hACE2  and the VOC RBDs and resolved the crystal and cryo- EM structures of the Omicron RBD-hACE2 complex  as well as the crystal structure of Delta RBD-hACE2 complex. We found that  unlike Alpha  Beta and Gamma  Omicron RBD binds to hACE2 at a similar affinity compared to that of the prototype RBD  which might be due to compensation of multiple mutations for both immune escape and transmissibility. The complex structures of Omicron-hACE2 and Delta-hACE2 reveal the structural basis of how RBD-specific mutations bind to hACE2.

Genomic alterations present in VOCs can affect the results of RT-qPCR assays for routine diagnostic purposes  leading to peculiar profiles that can be used for rapid screening of variants. In this work  we report on a peculiar profile observed with the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2  FluA  FluB  RSV Assay and VOC Alpha  202012 01  lineage B.1.1.7  also named VOC-UK   which was the first identified SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Methods Samples were analyzed by two RT-qPCR assays: the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2  FluA  FluB  RSV Assay  ASFR  Seegene Technologies Inc; Seoul  South Korea   and the TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR  Thermo Fisher Scientifics  USA . Definition of SARS-CoV-2 variant was carried out by Sanger sequencing of relevant S-gene regions and  in some cases  by whole genome sequencing  WGS  using the ARTIC-nCoV workflow on a MiniION  Oxford Nanopore Technologies  Oxford  UK  or a MiSeq ILLUMINA platform  San Diego  California  US . Results Of 173 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens  all those of lineage B.1.1.7  N=71  showed an average Cq difference between the N and S gene of +11±2  range  + 8 +15 .

METHODS: We tested whether serologically proven prior DENV infection diagnosed in September-October 2019  before the coronavirus 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinically apparent COVID-19 over the next 13 months in a population-based cohort in Amazonian Brazil. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of infection and disease  adjusting for potential individual and household-level confounders. Virus genomes from 14 local SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained using whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Anti-DENV IgG was found in 37.0% of 1 285 cohort participants  95% confidence interval [CI]  34.3% to 39.7%  in 2019  with 10.4  95% CI  6.7 to 15.5  seroconversion events per 100 person-years during the follow-up. In 2020  35.2% of the participants  95% CI  32.6% to 37.8%  had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 57.1% of the 448 SARS-CoV-2 seropositives  95% CI  52.4% to 61.8%  reported clinical manifestations at the time of infection. Participants aged >60 y were twice more likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 than under-five children. Locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates were assigned to the B.1.1.33 lineage. Contrary to the cross-protection hypothesis  prior DENV infection was associated with twice the risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection  with P values between 0.025 and 0.039 after adjustment for identified confounders. CONCLUSION: Higher risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 among individuals with prior dengue has important public health implications for communities sequentially exposed to DENV and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

Yet  how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems biological approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Vaccination resulted in robust production of neutralizing antibodies  nAbs  against the parent strain and the variant of concern  B.1.351  but no induction of autoantibodies  and significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. The innate response induced within the first 2 days of booster vaccination was profoundly increased  relative to the response at corresponding times after priming. Thus  there was a striking increase in the:  i  frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes;  ii  concentration of IFN- y in the plasma  which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells; and  iii  transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza  HIV and Ebola  within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination. Consistent with these observations  single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242 479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster  enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors  TFs  and reduced in AP-1 TFs  one day after secondary immunization  at day 21. Finally  we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1.351 variant strain. Collectively  these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines and demonstrate their capacity to stimulate an enhanced innate response following booster immunization.

They remained fully open in England during the third National lockdown when other educational settings were only open for selected children. EYSs are generally considered to be low-risk settings for transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS CoV-2 . METHODS: An observational study describing a large outbreak of SARS CoV-2 within an EYS in Cambridgeshire  United Kingdom. RESULTS: Overall 45 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified; 24 adults  71% of staff members  and 21 children  25% of nursery attendees . One case was identified as the alpha variant  B.1.1.7 [VOC-20-DEC-01] . One staff member became critically unwell. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred quickly  with a high attack rate; likely a consequence of a variant with enhanced transmissibility and an inability of the setting to adhere to infection control measures.

However  the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study  we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses  including those specific for the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   and Delta  B.1.617.2  variants  were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably  most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern  and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover  the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals  with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust  multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally  we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together  this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2  including variants of concern  and has implications for future booster strategies.

Although the majority of reports suggested that dogs’ susceptibility to the infection is low  little is known about viral pathogenicity and transmissibility in the case of variants of concern  such as B.1.1.7 in this species. Here  as part of a large-scale study on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in pets in Spain  we have detected the B.1.1.7 variant of concern  VOC  in a dog whose owners were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The animal did not present any symptoms  but viral loads were high in the nasal and rectal swabs. In addition  viral isolation was possible from both swabs  demonstrating that the dog was shedding infectious virus. Seroconversion occurred 23 days after the first sampling. This study documents the first detection of B.1.1.7 VOC in a dog in Spain and emphasizes the importance of performing active surveillance and genomic investigation on infected animals.

SARS-CoV-2 develops many types of mutations  such as B.1.1.7   making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Although we now have a preliminary understanding of COVID-19  including pathological changes  clinical manifestations  and treatment measures  we also face new difficulties. The biggest problem is that most COVID-19 patients might face sequelae  e.g.  fatigue  sleep disturbance  pulmonary fibrosis  during the recovery phase. We aimed to test six Chinese patent medicines to treat three major abnormal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the recovery phase  including cardiopulmonary function  sleep disturbance  and digestive function. We launched the “three syndromes and six Chinese patent medicines” randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter clinical trial on April 10  2020. The results showed that Jinshuibao tablets and Shengmaiyin oral liquid significantly improved the cardiopulmonary function of recovering COVID-19 patients. Shumian capsules  but not Xiaoyao capsules  significantly improved patients’ sleep disorders. This might be because the indication of Xiaoyao capsules is liver qi stagnation rather than psychological or emotional problems. Xiangsha Liujun pills and Ludangshen oral liquid significantly improved digestive function. Our research provides a guideline for treating COVID-19 sequelae in patients during the recovery period based on high-quality evidence.

By the end of March 2020  almost all colleges and universities in the United States had transitioned to an all online education and many institutions have not yet fully reopened to date. For a residential campus like Stanford University  the major challenge of reopening is to estimate the number of incoming infectious students at the first day of class. Here we learn the number of incoming infectious students using Bayesian inference and perform a series of retrospective and projective simulations to quantify the risk of campus reopening. We create a physics-based probabilistic model to infer the local reproduction dynamics for each state and adopt a network SEIR model to simulate the return of all undergraduates  broken down by their year of enrollment and state of origin. From these returning student populations  we predict the outbreak dynamics throughout the spring  summer  fall  and winter quarters using the inferred reproduction dynamics of Santa Clara County. We compare three different scenarios: the true outbreak dynamics under the wild-type SARS-CoV-2  and the hypothetical outbreak dynamics under the new COVID-19 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with 56% and 50% increased transmissibility. Our study reveals that even small changes in transmissibility can have an enormous impact on the overall case numbers. With no additional countermeasures  during the most affected quarter  the fall of 2020  there would have been 203 cases under baseline reproduction  compared to 4727 and 4256 cases for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Our results suggest that population mixing presents an increased risk for local outbreaks  especially with new and more infectious variants emerging across the globe. Tight outbreak control through mandatory quarantine and test-trace-isolate strategies will be critical in successfully managing these local outbreak dynamics.

The mAbs were designed to have reduced immune effector functions and increased circulation half-life. mAbs showed good binding affinities to non-competing epitopes on RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and were found neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617.2  and B.1.617.2 AY.1 in vitro. The mAb cocktail demonstrated effective prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. The antibody cocktail appears to be a promising candidate for prophylactic use and for therapy in early COVID-19 cases that have not progressed to severe disease.

Here we investigated primary nasal epithelial cultures  as well as vital explanted tissues to scrutinize the tropism of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the recently emerged B.1.1.7 variant. Our analyses revealed a widespread replication competence of SARS-CoV-2 in polarized nasal epithelium as well as in the examined URT and salivary gland tissues  which was also shared by the B.1.1.7 virus thereby highlighting the active role of these anatomic sites in COVID-19.

To control this pandemic continuous mutational surveillance and genomic epidemiology of circulating strains is very important to unveil the emergence of the novel variant and also monitor the evolution of existing variants. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from GISAID database. Sequence alignment was performed with MAFT version 7. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA version 7 and UShER. RESULTS: In this study  we reported the emergence of a novel variant of SARS-CoV-2 named B.1.1.526 in India. This novel variant encompasses 129 SARS-CoV-2 strains which are characterized by the presence of 11 coexisting mutations including D614G  P681H and V1230L in S-glycoprotein. Out of these 129 sequences  27 sequences also harbored E484K mutation in the S glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strains of this novel variant emerged from GR clade and formed a new cluster. Geographical distribution showed  out of 129 sequences  126 were found in seven different states of India. Rest 3 sequences were observed in USA. Temporal analysis revealed this novel variant was first collected from Kolkata district of West Bengal  India. CONCLUSIONS: The D614G  P618H and E484K mutations have previously reported to favor increased transmissibility  enhanced infectivity and immune invasion  respectively. The transmembrane domain  TM  of S2 subunit anchors S glycoprotein to the virus envelope. The V1230L mutation present within the TM domain of S glycoprotein might strengthen the interaction of S protein with the viral envelope and increase S protein deposition to the virion  resulting in more infectious virion. Therefore  the new variant having D614 G  P618H  V1230L and E484K may have higher infectivity  transmissibility and immune invasion characteristics and thus need to be monitored closely.

The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against this variant is not fully understood. Methods Using data from a recent large-scale outbreak of B.1.617.2 SARS-COV-2 infection in Jiangsu  China  we conducted a real-world study to explore the effect of inactivated vaccine immunization on the course of disease in patients infected with the Delta variant. Results Out of 476 patients with B.1.617.2 infection  184 were unvaccinated  105 were partially vaccinated  and 187 were fully vaccinated. Forty-two  8.8%  patients developed severe illness  of which 27  14.7%   13  12.4%   and 2  1.1%  were unvaccinated  partially vaccinated  and fully vaccinated  respectively  P <0.001 . All 15  3.2%  patients who required mechanical ventilation were unvaccinated. After adjusting for age  sex  and comorbidities  fully vaccinated patients had an 88% reduced risk of progressing to severe illness  ORadjusted: 0.12  95% CI: 0.02-0.45 . However  this protective effect was not observed in partially vaccinated patients  ORadjusted: 1.11  95% CI: 0.51-2.36 . Full immunization offered 100% protection from severe illness among women. The effect of the vaccine was potentially affected by underlying medical conditions  ORadjusted: 0.26  95% CI: 0.03-1.23 . Conclusion Full vaccination with inactivated vaccines is highly effective at preventing severe illness in Delta variant-infected patients. However  partial vaccination does not offer clinically meaningful protection against severe disease.

The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately  current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern  including the Delta variant. However  the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here  we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variant's receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding β-loop-β motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes. Our study shows reduced binding of neutralizing antibodies and provides a possible mechanism for the immune evasion exhibited by the Delta variant.

The Omicron  B.1.1.529  variant  first identified in Botswana on November 11  2021  has spread globally faster than any previous variant of concern. Understanding the transmissibility of Omicron is vital in the development of public health policy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks driven by Omicron to those driven by prior variants of concern in terms of both the speed and magnitude of an outbreak. METHODS: We analyzed trends in outbreaks by variant of concern with validated surveillance metrics in several southern African countries. The region offers an ideal setting for a natural experiment given that most outbreaks thus far have been driven primarily by a single variant at a time. With a daily longitudinal data set of new infections  total vaccinations  and cumulative infections in countries in sub-Saharan Africa  we estimated how the emergence of Omicron has altered the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We used the Arellano-Bond method to estimate regression coefficients from a dynamic panel model  in which new infections are a function of infections yesterday and last week. We controlled for vaccinations and prior infections in the population. To test whether Omicron has changed the average trajectory of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak  we included an interaction between an indicator variable for the emergence of Omicron and lagged infections. RESULTS: The observed Omicron outbreaks in this study reach the outbreak threshold within 5-10 days after first detection  whereas other variants of concern have taken at least 14 days and up to as many as 35 days. The Omicron outbreaks also reach peak rates of new cases that are roughly 1.5-2 times those of prior variants of concern. Dynamic panel regression estimates confirm Omicron has created a statistically significant shift in viral spread. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of Omicron is markedly higher than prior variants of concern. At the population level  the Omicron outbreaks occurred more quickly and with larger magnitude  despite substantial increases in vaccinations and prior infections  which should have otherwise reduced susceptibility to new infections. Unless public health policies are substantially altered  Omicron outbreaks in other countries are likely to occur with little warning.

Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations  including a trio in the spike protein  K417T  E484K  and N501Y  associated with increased binding to the human ACE2  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data  we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous  non-P.1  infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern  which may exhibit increased transmissibility and or immune evasion  is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.

While antibodies and other modalities have been developed to this end  d-amino acid peptides offer unique advantages  including serum stability  low immunogenicity  and low cost of production. Here  we designed potent novel D-peptide inhibitors that mimic the ACE2 α1-binding helix by searching a mirror-image version of the PDB. The two best designs bound the RBD with affinities of 29 and 31 nM and blocked the infection of Vero cells by SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50  values of 5.76 and 6.56 μM  respectively. Notably  both D-peptides neutralized with a similar potency the infection of two variants of concern: B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in vitro. These potent D-peptide inhibitors are promising lead candidates for developing SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic or therapeutic treatments.

The spike protein of Omicron has 26 amino acid mutations  which makes it distinct from the other variants of concern. Researches are underway to know the virulence and transmission rate of Omicron variant. In this letter  the seven-day moving average of most affected Omicron variant countries Denmark  Germany  India  Netherlands  South Africa and UK has been investigated and compared with each other. Further  the seven-day average of daily positive Omicron cases of the prescribed countries has been predicted for the months of December 2021  January 2022 and February 2022 using the fractal interpolation method. Results elucidate that the curve of daily positive case follows the same pattern even though the new variant of concern  Omicron added in the existing variants.

We acquired samples from all suspected cases and their contacts during the first month of the pandemic from Tygerberg Hospital. Nanopore sequencing generated SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes. Phylogenetic inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to determine lineages that seeded the local epidemic. Three patients were known to have travelled internationally and an outbreak was detected in a nearby supermarket. Sequencing of 50 samples produced 46 high-quality genomes. The sequences were classified as lineages: B  B.1  B.1.1.1  B.1.1.161  B.1.1.29  B.1.8  B.39  and B.40. All the sequences from persons under investigation  PUIs  in the supermarket outbreak  lineage B.1.8  fall within a clade from the Netherlands with good support  p > 0.9 . In addition  a new mutation  5209A>G  emerged within the Cape Town cluster. The molecular clock analysis suggests that this occurred around 13 March 2020  95% confidence interval: 9–17 March . The phylogenetic reconstruction suggests at least nine early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Cape Town and an early localized transmission in a shopping environment. Genomic surveillance was successfully used to investigate and track the spread of early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town.

However  vaccine responses are often suboptimal in this age group and few people over the age of 80 years were included in vaccine registration trials. We determined the serological and cellular response to spike protein in 100 people aged 80–96 years at 2 weeks after the second vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Antibody responses were seen in every donor with high titers in 98%. Spike-specific cellular immune responses were detectable in only 63% and correlated with humoral response. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased antibody responses after one vaccine and antibody and cellular responses remained 28-fold and 3-fold higher  respectively  after dual vaccination. Post-vaccine sera mediated strong neutralization of live Victoria infection and although neutralization titers were reduced 14-fold against the P.1 variant first discovered in Brazil they remained largely effective. These data demonstrate that the mRNA vaccine platform delivers strong humoral immunity in people up to 96 years of age and retains broad efficacy against the P.1 variant of concern.

The B.1.617.2  Delta  variant has been seen to be twice more transmissible coupled with potential increases in disease severity and immune escape. As a result  case numbers and hospitalisations are once again on the rise in the USA. On 16 July 2021  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  reported a 7-day average 69.3% increase in new cases and a 35% increase in hospitalisations. Although the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification remains genomic sequencing  this approach is not accessible to many clinical laboratories. The main goal of this study was to validate and implement the detection of the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant utilising an open reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  platform by explicitly detecting the S-gene target failure  SGTF  corresponding to the deletion of two amino acids  ΔE156 ΔF157  characteristic of B.1.617.2  Delta  variant. This approach was conceived as a rapid screening of B.1.617.2  Delta  variant in conjunction with CDC’s recommended N1  nucleocapsid gene   N2  and RP  human RNase P  genes  as a pre-screening tool prior to viral genomic sequencing. We assessed 4 937 samples from 5 July to 5 September 2021. We identified the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant in 435 of 495 positive samples  87.8% ; the additional positive samples  7 samples  1.4%  were found to belong to the B.1.1.7  Alpha  UK  lineage and the remaining 53 samples  10.7%  were reported as ‘other’ lineages. Whole genome sequencing of 46 randomly selected samples validated the strains identified as positive and negative for the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant and confirmed the S gene deletion in addition to B.1.617.2 characteristic mutations including L452R  T478K  P681R and D950N located in the spike protein. This modality has been used as routine testing at the Riverside University System Health  RUHS  Medical Center as a method for detection of B.1.617.2  Delta  to pre-screen samples before genome sequencing. The assay can be easily implemented in clinical laboratories  most notably those with limited economic resources and access to genomic platforms.

Previous research has examined the impact of national lockdowns on transmission. We aimed to examine the differences in the effect of localised restrictions on COVID-19 cases and how these differences varied by deprivation. Methods We examined the transmission impact of tier 3 restrictions using data on weekly reported COVID-19 cases  adjusted for case-detection rates for 7201 neighbourhoods in England. We identified areas that entered tier 3 restrictions in October and December  2020  constructed a synthetic control group of places under tier 2 restrictions  and compared changes in weekly infections over a 4-week period. Sufficiently granular data on deaths were not available to investigate excess mortality. We analysed whether this effect varied by level of deprivation and the prevalence of a new variant  B.1.1.7   by stratifying the synthetic control weighting by subgroups and then including an interaction term between subgroup and intervention in the regression model. We used the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation and its tertiles in the stratification to measure deprivation. We tested the spatial spillover effects excluding tier 2 areas within 20 km of tier 3 areas. Ethics approval was not needed. Findings The introduction of tier 3 restrictions was associated with a reduction in infections of 14%  95% CI 10–19  in October and of 20%  13–29  in December  or with a reduction in absolute number of total infections of 3536  95% CI 2880–4192  in October and of 92 732  49 776–135 688  in December  compared with what would have been expected under tier 2 restrictions. The effects were similar across levels of deprivation and by the prevalence of the new variant. We found smaller effects with high non-significant p values when excluding boundary areas. Interpretation Compared to tier 2 restrictions  restrictions on hospitality and meeting outdoors in tier 3 areas had a moderate effect on transmission and these restrictions did not appear to increase inequalities in COVID-19 cases. Limitations include a lack of specificity as to which of the main restrictions contributed to this effect  potentially biases from the crude measure of case-detection rates applied  and the lack of controls for individual or household characteristics in this ecological analysis.

The Omicron variant was officially announced by the South African authorities on the 24th of November 2021  with the first confirmed sample of the infection being collected on the 9th of November 2021. The initial cases were flagged as a possible new variant due to the stark differences in the presentation and clinical features of the patients. At the time of Omicron’s discovery  the predominant variant circulating within South Africa was the Delta variant B.1.617.2 which typically presented with more severe and distinct symptoms. Omicron spread rapidly within the Southern Africa and abroad  principally South Africa  Botswana  Hongkong and Israel were among the first countries to record cases of the new variant. The first European case of the Omicron variant was confirmed on the 26th of November 2021 in Belgium. Towards the end of November 2021 cases of the new variant had been confirmed and recorded in France  the United Kingdom  Germany  Portugal and Scotland. Additional cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed in Canada  Australia  India and United States. At this current point in the development of the Omicron upsurge in cases the international community should aim for further vaccinations among their fellow countrymen  but more so vaccine equality should be ensured. Such equality should be ensured in the developing nations as the virus does not respect any boundaries or territories and thus a higher level of vaccination worldwide will confer greater protection to the global community as a whole.

On July 30  2021  the Israeli Ministry of Health approved the use of a third dose of BNT162b2  booster  to cope with this resurgence. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the booster in lowering mortality due to Covid-19 is still needed. METHODS: We obtained data for all members of Clalit Health Services who were 50 years of age or older at the start of the study and had received two doses of BNT162b2 at least 5 months earlier. The mortality due to Covid-19 among participants who received the booster during the study period  booster group  was compared with that among participants who did not receive the booster  nonbooster group . A Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate the association of booster status with death due to Covid-19  with adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting conditions. RESULTS: A total of 843 208 participants met the eligibility criteria  of whom 758 118  90%  received the booster during the 54-day study period. Death due to Covid-19 occurred in 65 participants in the booster group  0.16 per 100 000 persons per day  and in 137 participants in the nonbooster group  2.98 per 100 000 persons per day . The adjusted hazard ratio for death due to Covid-19 in the booster group  as compared with the nonbooster group  was 0.10  95% confidence interval  0.07 to 0.14; P<0.001 . CONCLUSIONS: Participants who received a booster at least 5 months after a second dose of BNT162b2 had 90% lower mortality due to Covid-19 than participants who did not receive a booster.

We screened 20 COVID-19 patients for antibodies against 9 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins observing responses against the spike  S  proteins  the receptor-binding domain  RBD   and the nucleocapsid  N  protein which were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes. Importantly  mutations which typically occur in the B.1.351 “South African” variant  significantly reduced the binding of anti-RBD antibodies. Nine of 20 patients were critically ill and were considered high-risk  HR . These patients showed significantly higher levels of transforming growth factor beta  TGF-β  and myeloid-derived suppressor cells  MDSC   and lower levels of CD4 +  T cells expressing LAG-3 compared to standard-risk  SR  patients. HR patients evidenced significantly higher anti-S1 RBD IgG antibody levels and an increased neutralizing activity. Importantly  a large proportion of S protein-specific antibodies were glycosylation-dependent and we identified a number of immunodominant linear epitopes within the S1 and N proteins. Findings derived from this study will not only help us to identify the most relevant component of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response but will also enable us to design more meaningful immunomonitoring methods for anti-COVID-19 vaccines.

We conducted a project combining prevalence  seroprevalence  and genomic surveillance approaches to describe the initial pandemic stages in Betim City  Brazil. We collected 3239 subjects in a population-based age-  sex- and neighborhood-stratified  household  prospective; cross-sectional study divided into three surveys 21 days apart sampling the same geographical area. In the first survey  overall prevalence  participants positive in serological or molecular tests  reached 0.46%  90% CI 0.12–0.80%   followed by 2.69%  90% CI 1.88–3.49%  in the second survey and 6.67%  90% CI 5.42–7.92%  in the third. The underreporting reached 11  19.6  and 20.4 times in each survey. We observed increased odds to test positive in females compared to males  OR 1.88 95% CI 1.25–2.82   while the single best predictor for positivity was ageusia anosmia  OR 8.12  95% CI 4.72–13.98 . Thirty-five SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced  of which 18 were classified as lineage B.1.1.28  while 17 were B.1.1.33. Multiple independent viral introductions were observed. Integration of multiple epidemiological strategies was able to adequately describe COVID-19 dispersion in the city. Presented results have helped local government authorities to guide pandemic management.

Next-generation sequencing  NGS  of the whole genome is the gold standard for variant identification for surveillance but is time-consuming and costly. Rapid and cost-effective assays that detect SARS-CoV-2 variants are needed. We evaluated Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Master Assay and Variants I Assay to detect HV69 70 deletion  Y144 deletion  E484K  N501Y  and P681H spike mutations in 248 positive samples collected in Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  between January and May 2021. Spike variants were detected in 78 248  31.5 %   comprising 60 VOC B.1.351  beta  and 18 B.1.1.7  alpha . With NGS as reference for 115 samples  the sensitivity for detecting the spike mutations was 98.7 % with the Master Assay and 100 % with the Variants I Assay. The emergence of beta variants correlated with increasing COVID-19 infections in Malaysia. The prevalence of alpha VOC and lineage B.1.466.2 was low. These assays detect mutations present in alpha  beta and gamma VOCs. Of the VOCs which have subsequently emerged  the assays should detect omicron  B.1.1.529  but not B.1.617.2  delta . In conclusion  spike variant PCR assays can be used to rapidly monitor selected SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in resource-limited settings  but require updates as new variants emerge.

The safety and disease rates among vaccinated individuals were also evaluated. Since SARS-CoV-2 lineage P.1 is rapidly spreading in Argentina  virus-neutralizing activity of Sputnik-V-elicited and infection-elicited NAb faced to P.1 were also assessed. A total of 285 participants were recruited; all reported good tolerance  without any severe adverse event. Nine COVID-19 cases were confirmed in fully vaccinated individuals and viable P.1 variant was successfully isolated from one of them. At day 42  99.65% of the individuals had anti-S IgG; however  23.15% had not detectable NAbs. Significantly higher neutralization potency against WT compared to P.1  p < 0·001  was observed. Some samples failed to neutralize P.1  mainly among vaccinated-naїve subjects; however  no significant differences were observed among previously infected-vaccinated individuals. Our results corroborated that Sputnik-V is safe and induces an efficient humoral immune response  although not all immunized subjects develop Nabs. Herein  we show for the first time  evidence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding from Sputnik-V fully vaccinated individuals  by the isolation of viable virus from the nasopharyngeal swab of one participant of our study  139 days after receiving the second dose. Thereby  we provide evidence indicating that the vaccine might avoid severe forms of COVID-19 but does not prevent infection nor prevents transmission from a fully vaccinated individual.

METHODS: We recruited adult volunteers for homologous or heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with adenoviral  ChAdOx1  AstraZeneca  and or mRNA  mRNA-1273  Moderna  vaccines. Four groups of prime-boost vaccination schedules were designed: Group 1  ChAdOx1 ChAdOx1 8 weeks apart; Group 2  ChAdOx1 mRNA-1273 8 weeks apart; Group 3  ChAdOx1 mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart; and Group 4  mRNA-1273 mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart. The primary outcome was serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7  alpha  and B.1.617.2  delta  variants on day 28 after the second dose. Adverse events were recorded up until 84 days after the second dose. RESULTS: We enrolled 399 participants with a median age of 41 years and 75% were female. On day 28 after the second dose  the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers of both heterologous vaccinations  Group 2 and Group 3  were significantly higher than that of homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination  Group 1   and comparable with homologous mRNA-1273 vaccination  Group 4 . The heterologous vaccination group had better neutralizing antibody responses against the alpha and delta variant as compared to the homologous ChAdOx1 group. Most of the adverse events  AEs  were mild and transient. AEs were less frequent when heterologous boosting was done at 8 weeks rather than at 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Heterologous ChAdOx1 mRNA-1273 vaccination provided higher immunogenicity than homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination and comparable immunogenicity with the homologous mRNA-1273 vaccination. Our results support the safety and efficacy of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using the ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines.  ClinicalTrials.gov number  NCT05074368 .

In response to the rise of BA.1 and BA.2  two recent studies by Liu et al. and Iketani et al. provide a detailed analysis of loss of therapeutic antibody potency through evaluation of escape by pseudotyped viruses harboring BA.1 and BA.2 receptor binding domain  RBD  point mutations. Surprisingly  Liu et al. and Iketani et al. observed a profoundly broad escape effect for the individual mutations S371L and S371F. This result cannot be explained by known escape mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD  and conflicts with existing computational and experimental escape measurements for S371 mutations performed on monomeric RBD. Through an examination of these conflicting datasets and a structural analysis of the antibodies assayed by Liu et al. and Iketani et al.  we propose a mechanism to explain S371L F escape according to a perturbation of spike trimer conformational dynamics that has not yet been described for any SARS-CoV-2 escape mutation. The proposed mechanism is relevant to Omicron and future variant surveillance as well as therapeutic antibody design.

Methods: In this multicenter prospective descriptive cohort study  consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who received at least one dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were included. The time of study was from 1 July to 10 August of 2021. Results: Of the 94 consecutive patients from seven Andalusian ICUs admitted during the time of study  50  53.2%  received at least one dose of anti SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. No patient was admitted having previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The B.1.617.2  Delta  variant was the most frequently identified  in 80.76% of cases. Patients with a complete vaccination with non-optimal antibody levels were immunocompromised. Fifteen patients were admitted to the ICU with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  ARDS  without having completed their vaccination; the clinical profile was younger and with less comorbidities compared to patients with full vaccination. There were no differences in severity of ARDS. Conclusions: Most of the patients who were admitted to the ICU having received a dose of the vaccine were not optimally vaccinated; fully vaccinated patients who did not obtain optimal serum antibody levels were patients considered immunocompromised.

We found that the mutations K417N  E484K  and N501Y within the receptor-binding domains  RBDs  of the virus could confer ~2-fold higher binding affinity to the human receptor  angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2   compared to the wildtype RBD. The mutated version of RBD also completely abolishes the binding of bamlanivimab  a therapeutic antibody  in vitro. Detailed analysis shows that the ~10-fold gain of binding affinity between ACE2 and Y501-RBD  which also exits in the high contagious variant B.1.1.7 501Y.V1 from the United Kingdom  is compromised by additional introduction of the K417 N T mutation. Mutation of E484K leads to the loss of bamlanivimab binding to RBD  although this mutation does not affect the binding between RBD and ACE2.

Although a large amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 is available  the investigation of how viral functions change in response to mutations is hampered by a lack of effective structural analysis. Here  we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations  the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2  including Alpha variant  lineage B.1.1.7  and Delta variant  lineage B.1.617.2 . The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2  which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally  these structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The analysis of structural variations revealed how the coronavirus has gradually evolved in both structure and function and how the SARS-CoV-2 variants have contributed to more severe acute disease worldwide.

An alternative method has been to use genotyping of specific mutations to identify variants. However  tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants by targeted methods has been a moving target. Most methods only multiplex four targets per reaction  but we have multiplexed 8 targets in a single tube using fragment analysis. METHODS CASE REPORT: Fluorescently labeled primers targeted a combination of insertion  deletion mutations and single nucleotide mutations. The PCR amplified products  amplicons  were separated by capillary electrophoresis. Primers were designed to detect changes in size indicative of insertion or deletion mutations including: ORF1A:Del3675_3677  S:Del69_70  S:Del144  S:Del157_158  S:Del242_244  ORF8:Del119_120  and ORF8:ins28269-28273. Allele-specific primers were designed to detect both the wild-type and mutated versions of S:N501Y  S:E484K  and S:L452R. Residual nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or isothermal amplification  IDnow  methods were selected from May 1- June 24  2021. Variant analysis was performed by multiplex targeted PCR and whole genome sequencing in parallel on the same specimens to determine positive percent agreement. RESULTS  IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA : Variant analysis was performed on 250 specimens detecting each of the major variants of concern Alpha  B.1.1.7  U.K. origin  n= 108   Beta  B.1.351  South Africa origin  n=3   Gamma  P.1  Brazil origin  n=12   Delta  B.1.617.2  Indian origin  n=17   and Iota  B.1.526  New York  n=5 . Some specimens with low viral load were detected by only PCR  n=18   only WGS  n=41   or neither  n=20 . Overall positive percent agreement was 95%  163 171 . CONCLUSION: This adjustable method robustly and accurately identifies COVID-19 VOCs utilizing a platform amenable to multiple targets  20-40 targets ranging from 100-500b.p. across four fluorescent channels  using equipment commonly found in routine molecular pathology laboratories. Future directions include adjusting targets to detect new variants.

Materials & methods: Strains isolated from 143 COVID-19 cases in Turkey in April 2021 were assessed. Illumina NexteraXT library preparation kits were processed for next-generation ]sequencing. Phylogenetic  neighbor-joining method  and virtual phenotyping analyses  Coronavirus Antiviral and Resistance Database [CoV-RDB] by Stanford University  were used for variant analysis. Results: B.1.1.7–1 2  n = 103  72%   B.1.351  n = 5  3%  and B.1.525  n = 1  1%  were identified among 109 SARS-CoV-2 variations by phylogenetic analysis and B.1.1.7  n = 95  66%   B.1.351  n = 5  4%   B.1.617  n = 4  3%   B.1.525  n = 2  1.4%   B.1.526-1  n = 1  0.6%  and missense mutations  n = 15  10%  were reported by CoV-RDB. The two methods were 85% compatible and B.1.1.7  alpha  was the most frequent SARS-CoV-2 variation in Turkey in April 2021. Conclusion: The Stanford CoV-RDB analysis method appears useful for SARS-CoV-2 lineage surveillance.

Here we report a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2 -targeting monoclonal antibody  3E8  blocked the S1-subunits and pseudo-typed virus constructs from multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2  SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants  SARS-CoV-2-D614G  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  B.1.617.1  and P.1   SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63  without markedly affecting the physiological activities of ACE2 or causing severe toxicity in ACE2 “knock-in” mice. 3E8 also blocked live SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in a prophylactic mouse model of COVID-19. Cryo-EM and “alanine walk” studies revealed the key binding residues on ACE2 interacting with the CDR3 domain of 3E8 heavy chain. Although full evaluation of safety in non-human primates is necessary before clinical development of 3E8  we provided a potentially potent and “broad-spectrum” management strategy against all coronaviruses that utilize ACE2 as entry receptors and disclosed an anti-coronavirus epitope on human ACE2.

However  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants could confer immune evasion. Here we develop a bivalent nanoparticle vaccine  which displays the RBDs of both D614G and B.1.351 strains. With a prime-boost or a single-dose strategy  this vaccine elicits a robust neutralizing antibody and full protection against the infection of authentic D614G or B.1.351 strains in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgene mice. Interestingly  after 8 months since the D614G-specific vaccine inoculated  a new boost with this bivalent vaccine potently elicits cross-neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 variants in rhesus macaques. We suggest that the D614G B.1.351-bivalent vaccine could be used as an initial single-dose or a sequential enforcement-dose to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

The newly emerging variants N501Y.V1  B.1.1.7  and N501Y.V2  B.1.351   first reported in the United Kingdom and South Africa respectively  raised concerns due to the unusually rapid global spread. The mutations in spike  S  protein may contribute to the rapid spread of these variants. Here  with a vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV -based pseudotype system  we demonstrated that the pseudovirus bearing N501Y.V2 S protein has higher infection efficiency than pseudovirus with wildtype  WT  and D614G S protein. Moreover  pseudovirus with N501Y.V1 or N501Y.V2 S protein has better thermal stability than WT and D614G  suggesting these mutations of variants may increase the stability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and virion. However  the pseudovirus bearing N501Y.V1 or N501Y.V2 S protein has similar sensitivity to inhibitors of protease and endocytosis with WT and D614G. These findings could be of value in preventing the spread of virus and developing drugs for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Some variants show substantial resistance to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies. Here  we analyzed receptor binding domain-binding monoclonal antibodies derived from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-elicited germinal center B cells for neutralizing activity against the WA1 2020 D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants of concern. Of five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized the WA1 2020 D614G strain  all retained neutralizing capacity against the B.1.617.2 variant  four also neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant  and only one  2C08  also neutralized the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants. 2C08 reduced lung viral load and morbidity in hamsters challenged with the WA1 2020 D614G  B.1.351  or B.1.617.2 strains. Clonal analysis identified 2C08-like public clonotypes among B cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in 41 out of 181 individuals. Thus  2C08-like antibodies can be induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and mitigate resistance by circulating variants of concern.

Among the variants of interest and concern of SARS-CoV-2  the current Omicron  B.1.1.529  and stealth Omicron  BA.2  raised serious concerns due to rapid rates of infection caused by numerous mutations in the spike protein  which could escape from the antibody-mediated neutralization and increase the risk of reinfections. Hence  this work aims to describe the most relevant mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  discuss vaccine against variant of concerns  describe rare adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination  introduce the most available promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates  and provide few perspectives of the future variants.

Their genomes carry single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern  but lack the full complement of lineage-defining mutations. Instead  the remainder of their genomes share contiguous genetic variation with non-B.1.1.7 viruses circulating in the same geographic area at the same time as the recombinants. In four instances there was evidence for onward transmission of a recombinant-origin virus  including one transmission cluster of 45 sequenced cases over the course of two months. The inferred genomic locations of recombination breakpoints suggest that every community-transmitted recombinant virus inherited its spike region from a B.1.1.7 parental virus  consistent with a transmission advantage for B.1.1.7’s set of mutations.

Viruses constantly change through mutation  and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. In the United Kingdom  UK   a new variant called B.1.1.7 has emerged with an unusually large number of mutations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the level of protection of sera from 12 patients infected and later healed in Apulia Region  Italy  with Covid-19 between March and November 2020  when the English variant was not circulating in this territory yet  against the new VOC 202012 01 variant by seroneutralization assay. The sera of patients had already been tested before  using a virus belonging to the lineage B.1 and showed an antibody neutralizing titer ranging between 1:160 and 1:320. All the 12 sera donors confirmed the same titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained with a strain belonging to the lineage B.1.1.7  VOC 202012 01 . These data indicate that antibodies produced in subjects infected with variants of Sars-CoV-2 strain before the appearance of the English one  seem to have a neutralizing power also against this variant.

Currently  most of the research efforts towards the development of vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were mainly focused on the spike  S  protein  which mediates virus entry into the host cell by binding to ACE2. As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally  variants have emerged  characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein  we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012 01  B.1.1.7   termed the “UK variant”  in comparison with the wild type  with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein  regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain  RBD . In addition  we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant. Our work also adds useful structural information on antigenic “hotspots” and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.

We reanalysed 11 916 PCR-positive tests  41% of all positive tests  performed on 7–8 January 2021 in France. The prevalence of 20I 501Y.V1 was 3.3% among positive tests nationwide and 6.9% in the Paris region.

The ongoing epidemic is of major concern as the Delta variant is more infectious than previous variants that circulated in Australia in 2020. Using a re-calibrated agent-based model  we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions  including case isolation  home quarantine  school closures  and stay-at-home restrictions  i.e.  “social distancing.”  Our modelling indicated that the levels of reduced interactions in workplaces and across communities attained in Sydney and other parts of the nation were inadequate for controlling the outbreak. A counter-factual analysis suggested that if 70% of the population followed tight stay-at-home restrictions  then at least 45 days would have been needed for new daily cases to fall from their peak to below ten per day. Our model predicted that  under a progressive vaccination rollout  if 40–50% of the Australian population follow stay-at-home restrictions  the incidence will peak by mid-October 2021: the peak in incidence across the nation was indeed observed in mid-October. We also quantified an expected burden on the healthcare system and potential fatalities across Australia.

We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. METHODS: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes  as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes  asymptomatic infection  symptomatic infection  and COVID-19-related hospitalisation  severe or critical hospitalisation  and death  was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals  defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine  compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals  who had not received any doses of the vaccine   with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group  16–24  25–34  35–44  45–54  55–64  65–74  75–84  and ≥85 years   sex  and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. FINDINGS: During the analysis period  Jan 24 to April 3  2021   there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections  7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations  4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations  and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3  2021  4 714 932  72·1%  of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3%  95% CI 94·9–95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals  against SARS-CoV-2 infection  91·5%  90·7–92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days  against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection  97·0%  96·7–97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days  against symptomatic COVID-19  97·2%  96·8–97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days  against COVID-19-related hospitalisation  97·5%  97·1–97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days  against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation  and 96·7%  96·0–97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days  against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups  as vaccine coverage increased  the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure  giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94·5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups  ≥16 years  including older adults aged ≥85 years  in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations  severe disease  and death  including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic. FUNDING: None.

We previously showed protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease and pneumonia in hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Here  we observed a 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 did not lose weight compared to control animals. In contrast to control animals  the lungs of vaccinated animals did not show any gross lesions. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA  sgRNA  and no infectious virus was detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation showed extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals  but none in the vaccinated animals. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against clinical disease caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 VOCs.

However  the expression of these proteins is often difficult depending upon the expressed protein. In this study  we demonstrated that the addition of arginine hydrochloride and proline to the culture medium dramatically increased protein expression. By culturing bacterial cells in 96-well plates  we were able to rapidly examine the expression conditions and easily scale up to 96 mL of culture for production. Although functional expression of the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without any solubility-enhancing tag in bacterial strains  including Escherichia coli  has not been reported to date  we succeeded in efficiently producing RBD which showed a similar CD spectrum to that of RBD produced by eukaryotic cell expression systems. Furthermore  RBD from the omicron variant  B.1.1.529  was also produced. Physicochemical analyses indicated that omicron RBD exhibited markedly increased instability compared to the wild-type. We also revealed that the Fab format of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody C121 can be produced in large quantities using the same expression system. The obtained C121 Fab bound to wild-type RBD but not to omicron RBD. These results strongly suggest that the Brevibacillus expression system is useful for facilitating the efficient expression of proteins that are difficult to fold and will thus contribute to the rapid physicochemical evaluation of functional proteins.

Devido ao alto custo do sequenciamento genômico  a utilização de genotipagem por RT-PCR torna-se um método rápido de rastreamento de variantes de preocupação. Métodos Amostras positivas por RT-PCR para o gene N1 N2 do SARS-CoV-2 com CTs < 25 foram retestadas para a presença de mutações chaves de cada variante. Para demonstrar a evolução temporal das variantes  as amostras foram divididas em 7 grupos correspondente a 7 semanas. Foi utilizada RT-PCR com sondas TaqMan LNA específicas para determinadas mutações  em formato multiplex ou individuais: α69 70  variante alfa ; K417; K417T  P.1  gama  e T478K  delta . Os dados foram analisados pelo teste de Qui quadrado de Pearson  χ2 . Para as análises estatísticas  utilizou-se o software SPSS para Windows  versão 25.0.0.0. Resultados Foram analisadas 627 amostras  no período de 27 8 à 08 9 de 2021  com 47  119  126  92  106  51 e 95 amostras em cada semana  respectivamente. A RT-PCR para variantes alfa  K417 e P.1 demonstrou a presença de P.1  respectivamente  em 31 66%   58 49%   49 39%   19 21%   11 10%   0 0%  e 3 3 1%  amostras  sendo que não foi detectada a presença da variante alfa e beta  K417N . Após análise de uma amostragem de cada semana  para avaliar a presença da variante delta  excluídas as amostras positivas para P.1   foram testadas 10  19  25  22  36  36  60 amostras  onde 80%  95%  92%  95%  50%  88% e 95% tiveram a confirmação para delta  não sendo detectada a mutação K417N nestas amostras  excluindo a presença de delta plus. O teste χ2 mostrou que existe uma associação que difere as amostras com mutação 417 e sem mutação 417  tendo como valor de p < 0 001  com valor de grau de associação de V de cramer de 47 3%. Os resíduos ajustáveis demonstraram que nas semanas 1  2  3 e 4 havia mais amostras P.1  diminuindo nas semanas seguintes com aumento proporcional da variante delta. Discussão A RT-PCR descrita em tempo real demonstrou  em nossa área de atuação  a substituição gradativa da variante P.1 pela variante delta que  desde a semana 1  já estava presente em quantidade notável. A RT-PCR para mutações chaves de cada variante é um método custo-efetivo  rápido e eficaz para rastreamento  permitindo analisar grande quantidade de amostras  e melhor direcionar as que necessitam confirmação por sequenciamento completo.

Typically  genetic sequencing is required to be able to track VOCs in real‐time. However  sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT‐ddPCR offers an alternative to rapidly detect VOCs through discrimination of specific alleles such as N501Y  which is associated with increased transmissibility and virulence. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS‐CoV‐2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT‐PCR   RT‐ddPCR  and next‐generation sequencing. We initially screened 1035 samples positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by our CDC‐based laboratory‐developed assay using ThermoFisher's multiplex RT‐PCR COVID‐19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene target failures  SGTF  were subsequently assayed by RT‐ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid  AA  69‐70  ACATGT   deletion at AA 145   TTA   N501Y mutation  TAT   and S982A mutation  GCA . All four targets were detected in two specimens; follow‐up sequencing revealed a total of 9 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. Next  we continued screening samples for SGTF detecting 23 additional B.1.1.7 variants by RT‐ddPCR and confirmed by sequencing. As VOCs become increasingly prevalent  molecular diagnostic tools like RT‐ddPCR can be utilized to quickly  accurately  and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS‐CoV‐2.

Positive samples belonged almost exclusively  18 19  to the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 cluster  that might explain environmental contamination at this stage of the pandemic. The frequency and efficiency of disinfection in high-risk patient areas  such as EDs and ICUs  should be reinforced  especially during this period where highly transmissible variants of concern are widespread.

Mutations in the S gene can generate variants of concern  VOCs   which improve “viral fitness” through selective or survival advantages  such as increased ACE-2 receptor affinity  infectivity  viral replication  higher transmissibility  resistance to neutralizing antibodies and immune escape  increasing disease severity and reinfection risk. Five VOCs have been recognized and include B.1.1.7  U.K.   B.1.351  South Africa   P.1  Brazil   B.1.617.2  India   and B.1.1.529  multiple countries . In this review  we addressed the following critical points concerning VOCs: a  characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs with mutations in the S gene; b  possible evasion of variants from neutralizing antibodies generated through vaccination  previous infection  or immune therapies; c  potential risk of new pandemic waves induced by the variants worldwide; and d  perspectives for further studies and actions aimed at preventing or reducing the impact of new variants during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

These cases attended a gathering in Mozambique in mid-December 2020. Investigations led to the identification of five imported cases responsible for 14 transmission chains and a total 36 cases. Epidemiological characteristics seemed comparable to those described before the emergence of the South African variant B.1.351. The lack of tertiary transmission outside of the personal sphere suggests that distancing and barrier measures were effective.

Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches  we estimate that this variant has a 43 to 90%  range of 95% credible intervals  38 to 130%  higher reproduction number than preexisting variants. A fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows that VOC 202012 01 will lead to large resurgences of COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures  including limited closure of educational institutions and a greatly accelerated vaccine rollout  COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across England in the first 6 months of 2021 were projected to exceed those in 2020. VOC 202012 01 has spread globally and exhibits a similar transmission increase  59 to 74%  in Denmark  Switzerland  and the United States.

BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness  VE  against Beta infections in Israel  a country with high vaccine uptake. METHODS: The Ministry of Health  MoH  identified Beta cases through mandatory reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing  WGS  of specimens from vaccination-breakthrough infections  reinfections  arriving international travelers  and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals  CIs  against confirmed and probable Beta infections were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated  ≥7 days after the second dose  contacts  and between unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated  <7 days after the second dose  contacts. FINDINGS: MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27  2021. During the study period  Dec 11  2020 – Mar 25  2021   164 non-institutionalized primary Beta cases  with 552 contacts aged ≥16 years  were identified. 343 552  62%  contacts were interviewed and tested. 71 343  21%  contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was performed on 7 71  10%  PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts  48 71  68%  were symptomatic  10 71  14%  hospitalized  and 2 71  3%  died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or probable Beta infections was 72%  95% CI -5 – 97%; p=0·04  and against symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100%  95% CI 19 – 100%; p=0·01 . There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts. INTERPRETATION: In a prospective observational study  two doses of BNT162b2 were effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections. Through the end of June 2021  introductions of Beta did not interrupt control of the pandemic in Israel. FUNDING: Israel Ministry of Health and Pfizer.

The variants that attract most attention are those of public health concern  including B.1.1.7  UK   P.1  Brazilian  and B.1.351  South African . This list is extended by the variants of interest that emerge and are expanding in certain countries but are found sporadically in others  such as B.1.427 and B.1.429  Californians  or B.1.617  Indian . Whole genome sequencing or strategies specifically targeting the spicule gene are used in the microbiology laboratories for characterization and detection. The number of infected individuals  the sanitary situation of each country  epidemiological measures and vaccination strategies influence its dispersion and new variants are expected to emerge. This emergence can only be avoided today by increasing the vaccinated population in all countries and by not relaxing epidemiological containment measures. It is not excluded that in the future it will be necessary to revaccinate against new variants.

The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that engage evolutionarily conserved epitopes on coronavirus spike proteins represents a promising strategy to improve therapy and prophylaxis against SARS‐CoV‐2 and variants thereof. Herein  a facile multivalent engineering approach is employed to achieve large synergistic improvements in the neutralizing activity of a SARS‐CoV‐2 cross‐reactive nanobody  VHH‐72  initially generated against SARS‐CoV. This synergy is epitope specific and is not observed for a second high‐affinity nanobody against a non‐conserved epitope in the receptor‐binding domain. Importantly  a hexavalent VHH‐72 nanobody retains binding to spike proteins from multiple highly transmissible SARS‐CoV‐2 variants  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  and potently neutralizes them. Multivalent VHH‐72 nanobodies also display drug‐like biophysical properties  including high stability  high solubility  and low levels of non‐specific binding. The unique neutralizing and biophysical properties of VHH‐72 multivalent nanobodies make them attractive as therapeutics against SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.

The rapid development and deployment of extremely effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have seemingly brought within reach the end of the pandemic. However  the virus has acquired mutations; and emerging variants of concern  VOC  are more infectious and reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines. While promising efforts to combat these variants are underway  the evolutionary pressures leading to these variants are poorly understood. To that end  here we have studied the effects on the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain of three amino-acid substitutions found in several variants of concern  including alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   and gamma  P.1 . We found that these substitutions alter the RBD structure  stability  and ability to bind to ACE2  in such a way as to possibly have opposing and compensatory effects. These findings provide new insights into how these VOC may have been selected for infectivity while maintaining the structure and stability of the receptor binding domain.

To this end  a total of 111 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in Italy between 29 January and 27 March 2020 were investigated. The majority of the genomes belonged to lineage B.1  with some descendant lineages. The gene flow analysis showed that the spread occurred mainly from the north to the center and to the south of Italy  as confirmed by epidemiological data. The mean evolutionary rate estimated here was 8.731 × 10 −4   95% highest posterior density  HPD intervals 5.809 × 10 −4  to 1.19 × 10 −3    in line with values reported by other authors. The dated phylogeny suggested that SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1 probably entered Italy between the end of January and early February 2020. Continuous molecular surveillance is needed to trace virus circulation and evolution.

In this study  we compared African green monkeys infected intranasally with either the UK B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant or its contemporary D614G progenitor. Both variants caused mild respiratory disease with no significant differences in clinical presentation. Significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were found in upper and lower respiratory tract samples and tissues from B.1.1.7 infected animals. Interestingly  D614G infected animals showed significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus in rectal swabs and gastrointestinal tissues. Our results indicate that B.1.1.7 infection in African green monkeys is associated with increased respiratory replication and shedding but no disease enhancement similar to human B.1.1.7 cases.

Proteolytic cleavage activates the spike protein  thereby affecting both the cellular entry pathway and cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Here  we investigated the impact of the furin cleavage site on viral growth and pathogenesis using a hamster animal model infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing mutations at the furin cleavage site  S gene mutants . In the airway tissues of hamsters  the S gene mutants exhibited low growth properties. In contrast to parental pathogenic SARS-CoV-2  hamsters infected with the S gene mutants showed no body weight loss and only a mild inflammatory response  thereby indicating the attenuated variant nature of S gene mutants. This transient infection was sufficient for inducing protective neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Consequently  hamsters inoculated with S gene mutants showed resistance to subsequent infection with both the parental strain and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to lineages B.1.1.7 and P.1. Taken together  our findings revealed that the loss of the furin cleavage site causes attenuation in the airway tissues of hamsters and highlighted the potential benefits of S gene mutants as potential immunogens.

Variants are divided into three classes: variant of interest  variant of concern  and variant of high consequence depending on its impact on the transmission  disease severity  diagnostics  vaccines  and therapeutics. The variants of concern include the United Kingdom variant  B.1.1.7   South Africa variant  B.1.351   two related California variants  B.1.427 and B.1.429   and Brazil variant  P.1 . These SARS-CoV-2 variants have a direct impact on the available COVID-19 vaccines and immunotherapeutics as they can alter the neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies resulting in mild-to-substantial loss of efficacy. There is a need to establish surveillance systems that can monitor the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants worldwide.

The risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization are lower among fully vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons; this reduction is even more pronounced among those who have received additional or booster doses  boosters   3 4 . Although the B.1.1.529  Omicron  variant spreads more rapidly than did earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants  recent studies suggest that disease severity is lower for Omicron compared with that associated with the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant; but the high volume of infections is straining the health care system more than did previous waves  5 .*  The Los Angeles County  LAC  Department of Public Health  LACDPH  used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2  CAIR2  data to describe age-adjusted 14-day cumulative incidence and hospitalization rates during November 7  2021-January 8  2022  by COVID-19 vaccination status and variant predominance. For the 14-day period ending December 11  2021  the last week of Delta predominance  the incidence and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons were 12.3 and 83.0 times  respectively  those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 3.8 and 12.9 times  respectively  those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. These rate ratios were lower during Omicron predominance  week ending January 8  2022   with unvaccinated persons having infection and hospitalization rates 3.6 and 23.0 times  respectively  those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 2.0 and 5.3 times  respectively  those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. In addition  during the entire analytic period  admission to intensive care units  ICUs   intubation for mechanical ventilation  and death were more likely to occur among unvaccinated persons than among fully vaccinated persons without or with a booster  p<0.001 . Incidence and hospitalization rates were consistently highest for unvaccinated persons and lowest for fully vaccinated persons with a booster. Being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination is critical to protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated hospitalization.

Methods : SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced  n=277  and analysed with all available genomes from Vietnam and ASEAN countries to understand the phylodynamics. The observed lineages were assigned using Pangolin nomenclature and spread patterns were investigated. Results : Between January 2020 and 08 November 2021  VOCs including alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   gamma  P.1   and delta  B.1.617.2   were observed in ASEAN countries. While alpha and delta were the major VOCs in nine ASEAN countries  delta is the predominant. Among ASEAN countries  alpha VOC was first reported by Singapore  beta VOC by Malaysia  gamma VOC by Philippines and delta VOC by Singapore. Of the first 1000 genomes analysed from Vietnam  alpha and delta are the most represented  with delta being the dominant VOC since May 2021. The delta variant was introduced in early January 2021 and forms a large cluster within the representative genomes. Conclusion : Spatial and temporal monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical to understanding viral phylodynamics and will provide useful guidance to policy makers for infection prevention and control.

METHODS: In a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11 - May 5  2021  we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine  Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna  between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1210 participants  median age was 58 years  22.8% were Black  13.8% were Hispanic  and 20.6% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was most common variant  59.7% of sequenced viruses . Full vaccination  receipt of two vaccine doses ≥14 days before illness onset  had been received by 45 590  7.6%  cases and 215 620  34.7%  controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 86.9%  95% CI: 80.4 to 91.2% . Vaccine effectiveness was similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines  and highest in adults aged 18–49 years  97.3%; 95% CI: 78.9 to 99.7% . Among 45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations  44  97.8%  were ≥50 years old and 20  44.4%  had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among patients with immunosuppression  59.2%; 95% CI: 11.9 to 81.1%  than without immunosuppression  91.3%; 95% CI: 85.5 to 94.7% . CONCLUSION: During March–May 2021  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were highly effective for preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations among US adults. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was beneficial for patients with immunosuppression  but effectiveness was lower in the immunosuppressed population.

The pets were a dog and a cat from the same household  sampled two days after their owner tested positive for COVID‐19. The oral  nasal and fur swabs for both pets tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by qRT‐PCR and consensus whole‐genome sequences from the dog and cat were 100% identical and matched the B.1.1.7 VOC. Virus was isolated from the cat's nasal swab. One month after initial detection of infection  the pets were re‐tested twice at which time only the fur swabs  both pets  and oral swab  dog only  remained positive  and neutralizing antibodies for SARS‐CoV‐2 were present in both animals. Sneezing by both pets was noted by the owner in the weeks between initial and follow‐up testing. This study documents the first detection of B.1.1.7. in companion animals in the United States  and the first genome recovery and isolation of B.1.1.7 variant of concern globally in any animal.

Presently  it has almost reached 94 million cases worldwide. Lebanon on the brink of economic collapse and its healthcare system thrown into turmoil  has previously managed to cope with the initial SARS-CoV-2 wave. In this study  we sequenced 11 viral genomes from positive cases isolated between 2 February 2020 and 15 March 2020. METHODS: Sequencing data was quality controlled  consensus sequences generated  and a maximum-likelihood tree was generated with IQTREE v2. Genetic lineages were assigned with Pangolin v1.1.14 and single nucleotide variants  SNVs  were called from read files and manually curated from consensus sequence alignment through JalView v2.11 and the genomic mutational interference with molecular diagnostic tools was assessed with the CoV-GLUE pipeline. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences confirmed a multiple introduction scenario due to international travel. RESULTS: Three major lineages were identified to be circulating in Lebanon in the studied period. The B.1  20A clade  was the most prominent  followed by the B.4 lineage  19A clade  and the B.1.1 lineage  20B clade . SNV analysis showed 15 novel mutations from which only one was observed in the spike region.

A thorough physical exam and nasopharyngeal  oropharyngeal  and rectal swabs were collected for real-time reverse-transcription PCR  RT-qPCR  SARS-CoV-2 testing on day 0 and in successive samplings on days 7  14  21  and 47 during monitoring. Blood was also drawn to determine complete blood counts  biochemical profiles  and serology of the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2. On day 0  the cat case 1 presented with dyspnea and fever associated with a mild bronchoalveolar pattern. The dog cases 2  3  and 4 were healthy  but case 2 presented with coughing  dyspnea  and weakness  and case 4 exhibited coughing and bilateral nasal discharge 3 and 6 days before the clinical exam. Case 3  from the same household as case 2  remained asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR showed that the cat case 1 and the dog case 2 exhibited the lowest cycle threshold  Ct   Ct < 30  when they presented clinical signs. Viral detection failed in successive samplings. Serological analyses revealed a positive IgG response in cat case 1 and dog cases 3 and 4 shortly after or simultaneously to virus shedding. Dog case 2 was seronegative  but seroconverted 21 days after SARS-CoV-2 detection. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was attempted  and genomes were classified as belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage.

The aim of this study is to investigate SARS-CoV-2 variants and possible transmission of variants of concern  VOCs  in Sierra Leone. A total of 65 nasal swab samples were collected from COVID-19 cases in Sierra Leone  among which 24 samples were collected during the second wave and 41 samples were collected during the third wave. Nanopore sequencing generated 54 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes. The second COVID-19 wave was mainly caused by R.1 lineage while the third COVID-19 wave was dominated by B.1.617.2 lineage  Delta variant . The phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant into Sierra Leone and subsequent local transmission in this country. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the urgent need for implementation of strengthened public health and social measures  PHSM  to control the spread of virus variants.

The neutralizing potency of all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seems to be decreased against the variants of concern  VOCs . We assessed the sensitivity of the Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351  and Delta  B.1.617.2  variants to neutralizing antibodies  NAbs  present in sera from individuals who had received BIV1-CovIran candidate vaccine compared with an original Wuhan-related strain. Methods The ability of vaccine serum to neutralize the variants was measured using the conventional virus neutralization test  cVNT . Correlation of spike  S  protein antibody and anti-receptor binding domain  RBD  with neutralizing activity was investigated. Results Results of the current study demonstrated 29 32  90.6%; 95%CI: 75.0-98.0  of the vaccinees developed NAbs against a Wuhan-related strain. It is noteworthy that 28 32  87.50 %  87.50 %  and 24 32  75 %  of the recipients were able to produce NAbs versus Alpha  Beta and Delta variants  respectively. Serum virus-neutralizing titers for different SARS-CoV-2 strains were weakly correlated with anti-RBD antibodies  Spearman r = 36-42  p values < 0.05   but not S-binding antibodies  p values > 0.05 . Conclusions Although there was a reduction in neutralization titers against the variants of Alpha  Beta and Delta than Wuhan strain  the BIV1-CovIran still exhibited potent neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The official data of the National Health System were used  and a total of 69 539 vaccinated adults were compared with 175 687 unvaccinated. Among the subjects who received at least one vaccine dose  85 infections  0.12%   18 severe and 3 lethal COVID-19 cases were recorded after an average follow-up of 38 days. Among the unvaccinated  the numbers were 6948  4.00%   933  0.53%  and 241  0.14%   respectively. The serious adverse event reports—yet unconfirmed—were 24 out of 102 394 administered doses. In a Cox model  adjusting for age  gender  and selected comorbidities  the effectiveness of either BNT162b2  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or mRNA-1273 vaccines was higher than 95% in preventing infections  mostly due to B.1.1.7 variant   symptomatic or lethal COVID-19. No differences were observed across genders  and among the 691 subjects who received the second dose of vaccine later than the recommended date. Although preliminary  these findings support current immunization policies and may help reducing vaccine hesitancy.

Effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments are urgently needed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2  which binds to the receptor binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here  we developed recombinant human ACE2-Fc fusion protein  hACE2-Fc  and a hACE2-Fc mutant with reduced catalytic activity. hACE2-Fc and the hACE2-Fc mutant both efficiently blocked entry of SARS-CoV-2  SARS-CoV  and HCoV-NL63 into hACE2-expressing cells and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell–cell fusion. hACE2-Fc also neutralized various SARS-CoV-2 strains with enhanced infectivity including D614G and V367F mutations  as well as the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   B.1.617.1  Kappa   and B.1.617.2  Delta   demonstrating its potent and broad-spectrum antiviral effects. In addition  hACE2-Fc proteins protected HBE from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies  hACE2-Fc treatment did not induce the development of escape mutants. Furthermore  both prophylactic and therapeutic hACE2-Fc treatments effectively protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection  as determined by reduced viral replication  weight loss  histological changes  and inflammation in the lungs. The protection provided by hACE2 showed obvious dose-dependent efficacy in vivo. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that hACE2-Fc has a relative long half-life in vivo compared to soluble ACE2  which makes it an excellent candidate for prophylaxis and therapy for COVID-19 as well as for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infections.

To help guide public health policies it is important to monitor efficiently its spread. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta  but is time-consuming  expensive  and unavailable in many regions. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a rapid  simple and inexpensive alternative to sequencing for Delta identification. METHODS: A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR  DMAS-RT-PCR  was developed. The technique exploits allele-specific primers  targeting two spike gene mutations  L452R and T478K  within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3′ end. Specificity was assessed by testing well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples  most of which had previously been fully sequenced. RESULTS: In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing  and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants  Alpha and Beta   and ‘wild-type’ SARS-CoV-2. Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant globally.

Thus  some infections postvaccination are expected. Limited data are available on effectiveness in skilled nursing facilities  SNFs  and against emerging variants. The Kentucky Department for Public Health  KDPH  and a local health department investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in a SNF that occurred after all residents and health care personnel  HCP  had been offered vaccination. Among 83 residents and 116 HCP  75  90.4%  and 61  52.6%   respectively  received 2 vaccine doses. Twenty-six residents and 20 HCP received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  including 18 residents and four HCP who had received their second vaccine dose >14 days before the outbreak began. An R.1 lineage variant was detected with whole genome sequencing  WGS . Although the R.1 variant has multiple spike protein mutations  vaccinated residents and HCP were 87% less likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Vaccination of SNF populations  including HCP  is critical to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction  transmission  and severe outcomes in SNFs. An ongoing focus on infection prevention and control practices is also essential.

Using stratified Cox regression  we estimated adjusted hazard ratios  aHR  of hospital admission  aHR=0.85  95% CI 0.77-0.94   hospital admission or emergency care attendance  aHR=0.87  95% CI 0.81-0.94  and COVID-19 mortality  aHR=0.85  95% CI 0.71-1.03 . The results indicate that the risks of hospitalisation and mortality is similar or lower for AY.4.2 compared to cases with other Delta sub-lineages.

However  whole genome sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species have been scant. Here  we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  AY.3  in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived viral genomes showed the two to be identical  and differing by between 4 and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and time period. However  several mutations unique to the feline samples reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten human and animal health  as well as highlight the importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals. To the authors’ knowledge  this is the first published case of a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.

In this observational cohort study  we compared immunological responses in 144 individuals vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 and the vector vaccine ChAdOx1-nCoV-19  either alone  in combination  or in the context of COVID-19-convalescence. Unvaccinated COVID-19-convalescent subjects served as a reference. We found that cellular and serological immune responses  including neutralizing capacity against VOCs  were significantly stronger with mRNA vaccines as compared with COVID-19-convalescent individuals or vaccinated individuals receiving the vector vaccine ChAdOx1-nCoV-19. Booster immunizations with mRNA vaccines triggered strong and broadly neutralizing antibody and IFN-γ responses in 100% of vaccinated individuals investigated. This effect was particularly strong in COVID-19-convalescent and ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-primed individuals  who were characterized by comparably moderate cellular and neutralizing antibody responses before mRNA vaccine booster. Heterologous vaccination regimes and convalescent booster regimes using mRNA vaccines may allow enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2  including current VOCs. Furthermore  such regimes may facilitate rapid  re- qualification of convalescent plasma donors with high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

In Hong Kong  breakthrough outbreaks have occurred in July  third wave  and November  fourth wave  2020. We used whole viral genome analysis to study the characteristics of these waves. METHODS: We analyzed 509 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from Hong Kong patients between 22nd January and 29th November  2020. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses were performed  and were interpreted with epidemiological information. FINDINGS: During the third and fourth waves  diverse SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified among imported infections. Conversely  local infections were dominated by a single lineage during each wave  with 96.6%  259 268  in the third wave and 100%  73 73  in the fourth wave belonging to B.1.1.63 and B.1.36.27 lineages  respectively. While B.1.1.63 lineage was imported 2 weeks before the beginning of the third wave  B.1.36.27 lineage has circulated in Hong Kong for 2 months prior to the fourth wave. During the fourth wave  50.7%  37 73  of local infections in November was identical to the viral genome from an imported case in September. Within B.1.1.63 or B.1.36.27 lineage in our cohort  the most common non-synonymous mutations occurred at the helicase  nsp13  gene. INTERPRETATION: Although stringent measures have prevented most imported cases from spreading in Hong Kong  a single lineage with low-level local transmission in October and early November was responsible for the fourth wave. A superspreading event or lower temperature in November may have facilitated the spread of the B.1.36.27 lineage.

However  it is necessary to continue generating novel sets of monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity because viral variants can emerge that show resistance to the currently utilized antibodies. Here  we isolated a new cocktail of antibodies  EV053273 and EV053286  from peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from convalescent patients infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. EV053273 exerted potent antiviral activity against the Wuhan wild-type virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants in vitro  whereas the antiviral activity of EV053286 was moderate  but it had a wide-range of suppressive activity on the wild-type virus as well as the Alpha  Beta  Delta  Kappa  Omicron BA.1  and BA.2 variants. With the combined use of EV053273 and EV053286  we observed similar inhibitory effects on viral replication as with REGN-COV in vitro. We further assessed their activity in vivo by using a mouse model infected with a recently established viral strain with adopted infectious activity in mice. Independent experiments revealed that the combined use of EV053273 and EV053286 or the single use of each monoclonal antibody efficiently blocked infection in vivo. Together with data showing that these two monoclonal antibodies could neutralize REGN-COV escape variants and the Omicron variant  our findings suggest that the EV053273 and EV053286 monoclonal antibody cocktail is a novel clinically applicable therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The objectives of this study were to add context to the global data and international genomic consortiums  and to give insight into the efficiency of the contact tracing system in Oman. METHODS: We combined epidemiological data and whole-genome sequence data from 94 samples of SARS-CoV-2 in Oman to understand the origins  genetic variation  and transmissibility. The whole-genome size of sequence data was obtained through a customized SARS-COV-2 research panel. Amplifier methods ranged from 26 Kbp to 30 Kbp and were submitted to GISAID. FINDINGS: The study found that P323L  94.7%  is the most common mutation  followed by D614G  92.6%  Spike protein mutation. A unique mutation  I280V  was first reported in Oman and was associated with a rare lineage  B.1.113  10.6% . In addition  the study revealed a good agreement between genetic and epidemiological data. INTERPRETATION: Oman’s robust surveillance system was very efficient in guiding the outbreak investigation processes in the country  the study illustrates the future importance of molecular epidemiology in leading the national response to outbreaks and pandemics.

Despite extensive use  the effects of Sputnik V on B cell immunity need to be explored in detail. We performed comprehensive profiling of humoral and B cell responses in a cohort of vaccinated subjects  n = 22   and demonstrate that Sputnik vaccination results in robust B cell immunity. We show that B memory cell  MBC  and antibody responses to Sputnik V were heavily dependent on whether the vaccinee had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or not. 85 days after the first dose of the vaccine  ex vivo stimulated MBCs from the vast majority of Sputnik V vaccinees produced antibodies that robustly neutralized the Wuhan Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus. MBC-derived antibodies from all previously infected and some of the naïve vaccine recipients could also cross-neutralize Beta  B.1.351  variant of SARS-CoV-2. Virus-neutralizing activity of MBC-derived antibodies correlated well with that of the serum antibodies  suggesting the interplay between the MBC and long-lived plasma cell responses. Thus  our in-depth analysis of MBC responses in Sputnik V vaccinees complements traditional serological approaches and may provide important outlook into future B cell responses upon re-encounter with the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Difference in recovery patterns across these variants and the interaction with vaccination status has not been reported in population-based studies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to study the length of stay and temporal trends in RT-PCR cycle times  Ct  across alpha and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. METHODS: Participants consisted of patients admitted to national COVID-19 treatment facilities if they had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2  and analysis of variants was performed  using whole genome sequencing . Information on vaccination status  age  sex  cycle times  Ct  for four consecutive RT-PCR tests conducted during hospital stay  and total length of hospital stay for each participant were ascertained from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Patients infected with the delta variant were younger  mean age = 35years vs 39 years for alpha  p<0.001  and had lesser vaccination coverage  54% vs 72% for alpha  p<0.001 . RT-PCR Ct values were similar for both variants at the baseline test; however by the fourth test  delta variant patients had significantly lower Ct values  27 vs 29  p=0.05 . Length of hospital stay was higher in delta variant patients in vaccinated  3 days vs 2.9 days for alpha variant  as well as in unvaccinated patients  5.2 days vs 4.4 days for alpha variant  p<0.001 . Hazards of hospital discharge after adjusting for vaccination status  age  and sex was higher for alpha variant infections  HR=1.2  95% CI: 1.01–1.41  p=0.029 . CONCLUSION: Patients infected with the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have a slower recovery as indicated by longer length of stay and higher shedding of the virus compared to alpha variant infections  and this trend was consistent in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.

Sudden emergence and rapidly increasing numbers  of an otherwise rare infection in active Corona virus disease 2019  COVID-19  or recently recovered patients has made us question the cause for this epidemic in India. This retrospective cohort study was done at Government Ear  Nose and Throat  ENT  hospital  Hyderabad  a designated nodal centre for mucormycosis for the state of Telangana  between April 2021 and June 2021. This study included patients with mucormycosis who had a recent history of COVID-19 infection. Potential predisposing factors  diabetes mellitus  history of oxygen and corticosteroids usage  and inflammatory marker values  predominantly deranged in COVID-19 infection  D-dimer and Serum Ferritin  were evaluated. A correlation between the marker values and susceptibility factors was also studied. Majority of these subjects showed elevated serum markers and had one or more of the predisposing factors for COVID-19 associated mucormycosis  CAM . A significant association was found between elevated marker values and susceptibility factors  diabetes  use of oxygen . Contrary to the popular belief  that the inadvertent use of steroids  use of industrial oxygen or elevated blood sugars caused this epidemic  our study concludes that their role is limited to affecting the extent of morbidity mortality. B.1.1.7 and B.6.117 variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARSCoV2   predominant during the second wave in India  facilitated the fungal invasion and spread by altering the gene expression and inducing inflammatory and immunomodulatory changes.

Recently  a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs  becomes critical  we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance  ES  for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. Next-generation sequencing analysis of amplicons synthesized from sewage concentrates revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences  first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021  in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that  as well as B.1.1.7  our method can detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1  first identified in South Africa and Brazil  respectively  and other viruses carrying critical spike mutation E484K  known to have an effect on virus antigenicity. Although we did not detect such mutation in viral RNAs from sewage  we did detect mutations at amino acids 478  490  and 494  located close to amino acid 484 in the spike protein structure and known to also have an effect on antigenicity. IMPORTANCE The recent appearance and growth of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represent a major challenge for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity  which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Here  we show how environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can be used to help us understand virus transmission patterns and provide an early warning of variants becoming prevalent in the population. We describe the detection and quantification of variant B.1.1.7  first identified in southeast England in sewage samples from London  UK  before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious from clinical cases. Variant B.1.1.7 was first detected in a sample from early November 2020  with the frequency of B.1.1.7 mutations detected in sewage rapidly increasing to >95% in January 2021  in agreement with increasing SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with B.1.1.7 viruses.

It is not known whether the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant * which has been the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  in the United States since late June 2021  causes different clinical outcomes in children and adolescents compared with variants that circulated earlier. To assess trends among children and adolescents  CDC analyzed new COVID-19 cases  emergency department  ED  visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis code  and hospital admissions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 among persons aged 0-17 years during August 1  2020-August 27  2021. Since July 2021  after Delta had become the predominant circulating variant  the rate of new COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related ED visits increased for persons aged 0-4  5-11  and 12-17 years  and hospital admissions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 increased for persons aged 0-17 years. Among persons aged 0-17 years during the most recent 2-week period  August 14-27  2021   COVID-19-related ED visits and hospital admissions in the states with the lowest vaccination coverage were 3.4 and 3.7 times that in the states with the highest vaccination coverage  respectively. At selected hospitals  the proportion of COVID-19 patients aged 0-17 years who were admitted to an ICU ranged from 10% to 25% during August 2020-June 2021 and was 20% and 18% during July and August 2021  respectively. Broad  community-wide vaccination of all eligible persons is a critical component of mitigation strategies to protect pediatric populations from SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 illness.

Since the vaccine‐induced neutralizing antibody targets are the spike protein  this may lead to the possibility of vaccine‐induced humoral immunity escape. METHODS: We measured the neutralizing activity in vitro for Omicron and compared this with wild type  WH‐09  and Delta variants in human and monkey sera from different types of immunity. The monkey sera samples were collected at 1 and 3 months post three‐dose inactivated  PiCoVacc  and recombinant protein  ZF2001  vaccination. Human sera were collected from 1 month post three‐dose inactivated vaccination. RESULTS: In inactivated vaccine sera  at 1 3 months post three‐dose  geometric mean titers  GMTs  of neutralization antibody  NAb  against the Omicron variant were 4.9 5.2‐fold lower than those of the wild type. In recombinant protein vaccine sera  GMTs of NAb against Omicron were 15.7 8.9‐fold lower than those of the wild type. In human sera  at 1 month post three‐dose inactivated vaccination  GMTs of NAb against Omicron were 3.1‐fold lower than those of the wild type. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that despite a reduction in neutralization titers  cross‐neutralizing activity against Omicron and Delta variants was still observed after three doses of inactivated and recombinant protein vaccination.

There is an unmet need for effective treatments against COVID-19 for which neutralizing single domain antibodies  nanobodies  have significant potential. Their small size and stability mean that nanobodies are compatible with respiratory administration. We report four nanobodies  C5  H3  C1  F2  engineered as homotrimers with pmolar affinity for the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Crystal structures show C5 and H3 overlap the ACE2 epitope  whilst C1 and F2 bind to a different epitope. Cryo Electron Microscopy shows C5 binding results in an all down arrangement of the Spike protein. C1  H3 and C5 all neutralize the Victoria strain  and the highly transmissible Alpha  B.1.1.7 first identified in Kent  UK  strain and C1 also neutralizes the Beta  B.1.35  first identified in South Africa . Administration of C5-trimer via the respiratory route showed potent therapeutic efficacy in the Syrian hamster model of COVID-19 and separately  effective prophylaxis. The molecule was similarly potent by intraperitoneal injection.

Even from the start  the increase of this variant was due to transmission events within the community  some causing extensive clusters  rather than further imports. Most cases developed non-severe disease.

Since the very beginning  the spread of the virus has been tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing efforts. As of March 2021  more than 830 000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this first pandemic year. In parallel  nomenclatures systems  often with poor consistency among each other  have been developed to designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible  SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during the first ~ 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission. At the end of 2020 beginning of 2021  though  some alarming events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically  three new viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been described as variants of concern  VOC . These variants were first reported in the UK  B.1.1.7   South Africa  B.1.351  and Brazil  P.1 . Their designation as VOCs was determined by an increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from immunocompromised patients with long-term infection  suggesting a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to the identification of these lineages  as well as emerging data concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes  reinfection risk  vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential. Most of the available evidence is  to date  provisional  but still represents a starting point to uncover the potential threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic surveillance must be strengthened  especially in the wake of the vaccination campaigns.

Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain  RBD   but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants  we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains  including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma   B.1.429  epsilon   B.1.526  iota   A.23.1  and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution  but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance  but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection  COVID-19   but their effectiveness may be reduced by virus variants with mutations affecting the spike protein. To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants  we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. We found that the presence of a key substitution in variants with multiple spike substitutions can predict resistance against a variant but that other substitutions can affect the degree of resistance in unpredictable ways. These findings highlight complex interactions among substitutions in the spike protein affecting virus neutralization and  potentially  virus entry into cells.

In this study  a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy for COVID-19 was designed to prime with a DNA vaccine encoding wild type  WT  spike protein receptor-binding domain  RBD  followed by S1 protein-based vaccine in rabbits. Four vaccine-elicited rabbit monoclonal antibodies  RmAbs   including 1H1  9H1  7G5  and 5E1  were isolated for biophysical property  neutralization potency and sequence analysis. All RmAbs recognized RBD or S1 protein with K D  in the low nM or sub nM range. 1H1 and 9H1  but neither 7G5 nor 5E1  can bind to all RBD protein variants derived from B.1.351. All four RmAbs were able to neutralize wild type  WT  SARS-CoV-2 strain in pseudovirus assay  and 1H1 and 9H1 could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 WT authentic virus with IC 50  values of 0.136 and 0.026 μg mL  respectively. Notably  1H1 was able to neutralize all 6 emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants tested including D614G  B.1.1.7  B.1.429  P.1  B.1.526  and B.1.351 variants  and 5E1 could neutralize against the above 5 variants except P.1. Epitope binning analysis revealed that 9H1  5E1 and 1H1 recognized distinct epitopes  while 9H1 and 7G5 may have overlapping but not identical epitope. In conclusion  DNA priming protein boost vaccination was an effective strategy to induce RmAbs with potent neutralization capability against not only SARS-CoV-2 WT strain but also emergent variants  which may provide a new avenue for effective therapeutics and point-of-care diagnostic measures.

Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally  of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7  the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2  each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately. RESULTS: Due to the lack of publicly available pipelines  which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern  we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HAVoC  Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants of Concern . HAVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: HAVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HAVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. HAVoC user manual and source code are available at https:  www.helsinki.fi en projects havoc and https:  bitbucket.org auto_cov_pipeline havoc  respectively.

We enrolled vaccinated  n = 39  and unvaccinated  n = 11  individuals with acute  symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron infection and performed SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification  whole-genome sequencing  and variant-specific antibody characterization at the time of acute illness and convalescence. Viral load at the time of infection was inversely correlated with antibody binding and neutralizing antibody responses. Increases in antibody titers and neutralizing activity occurred at convalescence in a variant-specific manner. Across all variants tested  convalescent neutralization titers in unvaccinated individuals were markedly lower than in vaccinated individuals. For individuals infected with the Delta variant  neutralizing antibody responses were weakest against BA.2  whereas infection with Omicron BA.1 variant generated a broader response against all tested variants  including BA.2.

CRISPR  Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats  has the potential to transform diagnostics due to its programmability. However  many of the CRISPR-based detection methods are reliant on either a multi-step process involving amplification or elaborate guide RNA designs. A complete one-pot detection reaction using alternative Cas effector endonucleases has been proposed to overcome these challenges. Yet  current approaches using Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus Cas12b  AapCas12b  are limited by its thermal instability at optimum reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  reaction temperatures. Herein  we demonstrate that a novel Cas12b from Brevibacillus sp. SYP-B805  referred to as BrCas12b  has robust trans-cleavage activity at ideal RT-LAMP conditions. A competitive profiling study of BrCas12b against Cas12b homologs from other bacteria genera underscores the potential of BrCas12b in the development of new diagnostics. As a proof-of-concept  we incorporated BrCas12b into an RT-LAMP-mediated one-pot reaction system  coined CRISPR-SPADE  CRISPR Single Pot Assay for Detecting Emerging VOCs  to enable rapid  differential detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  including Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   and Delta  B.1.617.2  in 205 clinical samples. Notably  a BrCas12b detection signal was observed within 1-3 minutes of amplification  achieving an overall 98.1% specificity  91.2% accuracy  and 88.1% sensitivity within 30 minutes. Significantly  for samples with high viral load  C  t  value â‰¤ 30   100% accuracy and sensitivity were attained. To facilitate dissemination and global implementation of the assay  we combined the lyophilized one-pot reagents with a portable multiplexing device capable of interpreting fluorescence signals at a fraction of the cost of a qPCR system. With relaxed design requirements  one-pot detection  and simple instrumentation  this assay has the capability to advance future diagnostics.

The three variants were associated with an increase in transmissibility and worsening of the epidemiological situation in the places where they expanded. The lineage B.1.1.7 was associated with the increase in case fatality rate in the United Kingdom. There are still no studies on the case fatality rate of the other two variants. The aim of this study was to analyze the mortality profile before and after the emergence of the P.1 strain in the Amazonas state. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System  SIVEP-Gripe  Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe   comparing two distinct epidemiological periods: during the peak of the first wave  between April and May 2020  and in January 2021  the second wave   the month in which the new variant came to predominate. We calculated mortality rates  overall case fatality rate and case fatality rate among hospitalized patients; all rates were calculated by age and gender and 95% confidence intervals  95% CI  were determined. FINDINGS: We observed that in the second wave there were a higher incidence and an increase in the proportion of cases of COVID-19 in the younger age groups. There was also an increase in the proportion of women among Severe Acute Respiratory Infection  SARI  cases from 40%  2 709  in the first wave to 47%  2 898  in the second wave and in the proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 between the two periods varying from 34%  1 051  to 47%  1 724   respectively. In addition  the proportion of deaths among people between 20 and 59 years old has increased in both sexes. The case fatality rate among those hospitalized in the population between 20 and 39 years old during the second wave was 2.7 times the rate observed in the first wave  female rate ratio = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.9-3.9]  p <0.0001; male rate ratio = 2.70  95%CI:2.0-3.7   and in the general population the rate ratios were 1.15  95% CI: 1.1-1.2  in females and 0.78  95% CI: 0.7-0.8  in males]. INTERPRETATION: Based on this prompt analysis of the epidemiological scenario in the Amazonas state  the observed changes in the pattern of mortality due to COVID-19 between age groups and gender simultaneously with the emergence of the P.1 strain suggest changes in the pathogenicity and virulence profile of this new variant. Further studies are needed to better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variants profile and their impact for the health population. FUNDING: There was no funding for this study.

Novel variations that are unique to the receptor‐binding motif  RBM  of the receptor‐binding domain  RBD  spike glycoprotein  i. e. L452R‐E484Q  may play a different role in the B.1.617  also known as G 452R.V3  variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore  a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor  RBD  and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study  we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations  L452R‐E484Q  in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic‐stability  residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover  the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural‐dynamics properties significantly. MM GBSA technique was used  which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion  this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.

A few different amino acids in the spike proteins of these lineages can hamper both natural immunity against reinfection  and vaccine efficacy. In this study  the in vitro neutralizing potency of sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinated subjects was analyzed against six different SARS-CoV-2 lineages  including the latest B.1.617.2  or Delta variant   in order to assess the cross-neutralization by anti-spike antibodies. After both single dose vaccination  or natural infection  the neutralizing activity was low and fully effective only against the original lineage  while a double dose or a single dose of vaccine  even one year after natural infection  boosted the cross-neutralizing activity against different lineages. Neither binding  nor the neutralizing activity of sera after vaccination  could predict vaccine failure  underlining the need for additional immunological markers. This study points at the importance of the anamnestic response and repeated vaccine stimulations to elicit a reasonable cross-lineage neutralizing antibody response.

The emergence of variants of concern  VOCs  has become one of the most pressing issues in public health. To control VOCs  it is important to know which COVID-19 convalescent sera have cross-neutralizing activity against VOCs and how long the sera maintain this protective activity. METHODS: Sera of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 to January 2021 and admitted to Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center were selected. Blood was drawn from patients at 1-3  3-6  and 6-8 months post onset. Then  a virus neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2 variants  D614G mutation as conventional strain; B.1.1.7  P.1  and B.1.351 as VOCs  was performed using authentic viruses. RESULTS: We assessed 97 sera from 42 patients. Sera from 28 patients showed neutralizing activity that was sustained for 3-8 months post onset. The neutralizing antibody titer against D614G significantly decreased in sera of 6-8 months post onset compared to those of 1-3 months post onset. However  the neutralizing antibody titers against the three VOCs were not significantly different among 1-3  3-6  and 6-8 months post onset. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that neutralizing antibodies that recognize the common epitope for several variants may be maintained for a long time  while neutralizing antibodies having specific epitopes for a variant  produced in large quantities immediately after infection  may decrease quite rapidly.

Serum antibody titers measured by ELISA were above 1:106  and the neutralizing antibody titer against authentic virus  WT  was 1:14 604  average PRNT90 . Plasma from immunized animals was pepsin digested to remove the Fc portion and purified  yielding an F ab’ 2 preparation with PRNT90 titers 150-fold higher than the neutralizing titers in human convalescent plasma. Challenge studies were carried out in hamsters and showed the in vivo ability of equine F ab’ 2 to reduce viral load in the pulmonary tissues and significant clinical improvement determined by weight gain. The neutralization curve by F ab’ 2 was similar against WT and P.2 variant but displaced to higher concentrations by 0.39 log units against P.1  Gamma  variant. These results support the possibility of using equine F ab’ 2 preparation for the clinical treatment of COVID patients.

Methods: Sixty-four patients who received Rituximab within the last seven years prior to the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were recruited in a prospective observational study. Anti-S1 IgG  SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralization  and various SARS-CoV-2 target antibodies were determined. A live virus assay was used to assess neutralizing antibody activity against B.1.617.2  delta . In Rituximab-treated patients  CD19 +  peripheral B-cells were quantified using flow cytometry. Results: After second vaccination  all antibodies were significantly reduced compared to healthy controls. Neutralizing antibody activity against B.1.617.2  delta  was detectable with a median  IQR  ID 50  of 0  0–1:20  compared to 1:320  1:160–1:320  in healthy controls  for all p < 0.001 . Longer time period since last Rituximab administration correlated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and a stronger neutralization of B.1.617.2  delta . With one exception  only patients with a CD19 +  cell proportion ≥ 1% had detectable neutralizing antibodies. Conclusion: Our data indicate that a reconstitution of the B-cell population to >1% seems crucial in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be administered at least 8–12 months after the last Rituximab treatment for sufficient humoral responses.

Some compounds showed 100% inhibition against the cytopathic effects  CPE; IC 100   of an authentic SARS-CoV-2  US_WA-1 2020  variant at 1.25 µM. The most active inhibitors also potently inhibited variants of concern  VOCs   including the UK  B.1.1.7  and South African  B.1.351  variants and the Delta variant  B.1.617.2  originally identified in India in pseudovirus-based assay. Surface plasmon resonance  SPR  analysis with one potent inhibitor confirmed that it binds to the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer. These small-molecule inhibitors prevented virus-mediated cell–cell fusion. The absorption  distribution  metabolism  and excretion  ADME  data for one of the most active inhibitors  NBCoV1  demonstrated drug-like properties. An in vivo pharmacokinetics  PK  study of NBCoV1 in rats demonstrated an excellent half-life  t 1 2   of 11.3 h  a mean resident time  MRT  of 14.2 h  and oral bioavailability. We expect these lead inhibitors to facilitate the further development of preclinical and clinical candidates.

However  their infectivity and sensitivity to administered vaccines have not been documented. We monitored neutralization potential of convalescent or BNT162b2-post-vaccination sera against Kappa and Delta SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We show that both variants were successfully neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination sera  exhibiting a mild decrease in their neutralization sensitivity. Of the two variants  Delta presented enhanced infectivity levels compared to Kappa or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless  both variants were not as infectious or resistant to post-vaccination sera as the Beta variant of concern. Interestingly  the Delta plus variant  AY.1 B.1.617.2.1  exhibited high resistance to post-vaccination sera  similar to that of the Beta SARS-CoV-2. However  its infectivity levels were close to those of wild-type SARS-CoV2. These results account for the worldwide prevalence of Delta variant of concern  and confirm the efficacy of the BNT162b2-vaccine against circulating other Delta variants.

Analysis of neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of vaccinated individuals without previous history of infection and from convalescent individuals showed partial resistance of the viruses. In contrast  sera from individuals with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were subsequently vaccinated  neutralized variants with titers 4-11-fold higher  providing a rationale for vaccination of infection-experienced individuals. The heavily mutated C.1.2 spike was the most antibody neutralization-resistant spike to date; however  the avidity of C.1.2 spike protein for ACE2 was low. This finding suggests that the virus evolved to escape the humoral response but has a decrease in fitness suggesting that it may cause milder disease or be less transmissible. It may be difficult for the spike protein to evolve to escape neutralizing antibodies while maintaining high affinity for ACE2.

In this study  we continued our efforts to develop more efficient SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors and achieved significant findings. First  we found that the membrane-proximal external region  MPER  sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike fusion protein plays a critical role in viral infectivity and can serve as an ideal template for design of fusion-inhibitory peptides. Second  a panel of novel lipopeptides was generated with greatly improved activity in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 fusion and infection. Third  we showed that the new inhibitors maintained the potent inhibitory activity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants  including those with the major mutations of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains circulating in the United Kingdom and South Africa  respectively. Fourth  the new inhibitors also cross-inhibited other human CoVs  including SARS-CoV  MERS-CoV  HCoV-229E  and HCoV-NL63. Fifth  the structural properties of the new inhibitors were characterized by circular dichroism  CD  spectroscopy and crystallographic approach  which revealed the mechanisms underlying the high binding and inhibition. Combined  our studies provide important information for understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 fusion and a framework for the development of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs.

The disease causes high morbidity and mortality given that diagnosis is often delayed  and that is progresses rapidly. Given the sheer magnitude of the outbreak  the Indian Health Ministry has advised all states to declare mucormycosis an epidemic. Typically  the disease has been found linked to COVID-19 infections caused by the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant which has spread rapidly throughout India. This variant has already become a cause for global concern  having spread to at least 40 countries  including the USA  and UK. We present the findings of a study conducted on post-COVID Mucormycosis patients and discusses the associated risk factors to raise awareness for OMFS colleagues.

However  delays of boost immunization due to limited availability of vaccines may leave individuals vulnerable to infection and prolonged or severe disease courses. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants of concern  VOC —B.1.1.7  United Kingdom   B.1.351  South Africa   and P.1  Brazil —may exacerbate this issue  as the latter two are able to evade control by antibodies. METHODS: We assessed humoral and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type  WT   VOC  and endemic human coronaviruses  hCoVs  that were induced after single and double vaccination with BNT162b2. RESULTS: Despite readily detectable immunoglobulin G  IgG  against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at day 14 after a single vaccination  inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-driven host cell entry was weak and particularly low for the B.1.351 variant. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 WT and VOC-specific T cells were low in many vaccinees after application of a single dose and influenced by immunity against endemic hCoV. The second vaccination significantly boosted T-cell frequencies reactive for WT and B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. CONCLUSIONS: These results call into question whether neutralizing antibodies significantly contribute to protection against COVID-19 upon single vaccination and suggest that cellular immunity is central for the early defenses against COVID-19.

Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y  lineage B.1.1.7  first identified in the UK   and the combination N501Y  E484K  K417N  B.1.351  first identified in South Africa   all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain  RBD . We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 7-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation only slightly enhances the affinity for the receptor  while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result  RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 2-fold weaker than N501Y. However  the recently emerging double mutant E484K N501Y binds even stronger than N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity  viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.

We describe the phylogenomic and population genetic patterns of the virus in Mexico during the pre-vaccination stage  including asymptomatic carriers. A real-time quantitative PCR screening and phylogenomic reconstructions directed at sequence structure analysis of the spike glycoprotein revealed mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico  in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C S:452R  B.1.427 9 . Overall  the detected variants in Mexico show spike protein mutations in the N-terminal domain  i.e. R190M   in the receptor-binding motif  i.e. T478K  E484K   within the S1–S2 subdomains  i.e. P681R H  T732A   and at the basis of the protein  V1176F  raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the variants of interest we postulate: 20B 478K.V1  B.1.1.222 or B.1.1.519  and 20B P.4  B.1.1.28.4 . Moreover  the population patterns of single nucleotide variants from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers obtained with a self-sampling scheme confirmed the presence of several fixed variants  and differences in allelic frequencies among localities. We identified the mutation N:S194L of the nucleocapsid protein associated with symptomatic patients. Phylogenetically  this mutation is frequent in Mexican sub-clades. Our results highlight the dual and complementary role of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to their hosts and provide a baseline for specific follow-up of mutations of concern during the vaccination stage.

Delta  in particular B.1.617.2  is largely and rapidly replacing the Alpha VOC as the dominant clade in most countries. To date  variations in the Spike protein of the Delta VOC have largely been limited. We report here the results of a genomic surveillance programme from Northern Italy. We identified several Delta sublineages harbouring mutations previously reported in GISAID at extremely low frequencies and in different combinations. Two patients  one of them vaccinated  tested positive for a Delta sublineage harbouring S71F  T250I  T572I and K854N. More patients tested positive for G769 V plus C1248F  A352S  and R158G and C1248F  respectively. Genomic surveillance of Delta variants should be encouraged to anticipate immune escape and deploy countermeasures.

Recently  a new variant of SARS-CoV-2  known as B.1.1.7  was first detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries  heightening public health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy resistance  host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes. Here  in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus   we find two host-directed drugs  plitidepsin  aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A  and ralimetinib  inhibits p38 MAP kinase cascade   as well as remdesivir  to possess similar antiviral activity against both the early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant  evaluated in both human gastrointestinal and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent than remdesivir against both viruses. These results highlight the importance of continued development of host-directed therapeutics to combat current and future coronavirus variant outbreaks.

Here  we tested the sera from 248 COVID-19 convalescents around one year post-infection in Wuhan  the earliest known epicenter. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G  IgG  were well maintained in most patients and potently neutralizes the infection of the original strain and the B.1.1.7 variant. However  varying degrees of immune escape was observed on the other tested variants in a patient-specific manner  with individuals showing remarkably broad neutralization potency. The immune escape can be largely attributed to several critical spike mutations. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can elicit long-lasting immunity but escaped by the emerging variants.

The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83–2.18 [95% CI: 1.71–2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020  and in range 1.65–1.72 [95% CI: 1.46–2.04] in Wales  Scotland  Denmark  and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation  it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K  F490S  S494P  in the receptor binding motif of spike  and Q677H  Q675H  in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1 S2 boundary . These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.

While several of these become rare  others largely increase in prevalence  potentially jeopardizing the sensitivity of PCR-based diagnostics. Taking advantage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic knowledge  we designed a one-step probe-based multiplex RT-qPCR  OmniSARS2  to simultaneously detect short fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in ORF1ab  E gene and S gene. Comparative genomics of the most common SARS-CoV-2 lineages  other human betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus  was the basis for this design  targeting both highly conserved regions across SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variable or absent in other Coronaviridae viruses. The highest analytical sensitivity of this method for SARS-CoV-2 detection was 94.2 copies mL at 95% detection probability  ~1 copy per total reaction volume  for the S gene assay  matching the most sensitive available methods. In vitro specificity tests  performed using reference strains  showed no cross-reactivity with other human coronavirus or common pathogens. The method was compared with commercially available methods and detected the virus in clinical samples encompassing different SARS-CoV-2 lineages  including B.1  B.1.1  B.1.177 or B.1.1.7 and rarer lineages. OmniSARS2 revealed a sensitive and specific viral detection method that is less likely to be affected by lineage evolution oligonucleotide–sample mismatch  of relevance to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 molecular diagnostic methods.

In order to contain the spread of these lineages  it is of utmost importance to have rapid  sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand. METHODS: A set of RT-qPCR assays was modified for a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay including detection of the del-HV69 70 and N501Y mutations on the cobas6800 platform. Analytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. For clinical performance  a total of 176 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and next generation sequencing as gold standard. RESULTS: The multiplex assay was highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples  with an LoD of 6.16 cp ml  CI: 4.00 – 8.31 . LoDs were slightly higher for detection of the HV69 70 deletion  85.92  CI: 61 – 194.41  and the N501Y SNP  105.99 cp ml  CI: 81.59 – 183.66 . A total of 176 clinical samples were tested with the assay  including 50 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage  one containing B.1.351 and 85 non-B.1.1.7 B.1.351 lineage  of which three also harbored a HV69 70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay. CONCLUSION: We describe here a highly sensitive  fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of the del-HV69 70 and N501Y mutations that can distinguish between B.1.1.7 and other lineages. The assay allows for high-throughput screening for currently relevant variants in clinical samples prior to sequencing.

This study lays the groundwork for the development of a novel subunit vaccine candidate from the circulating strains of South African SARS-CoV-2 and provides an understanding of the molecular epidemiological trend of the circulating strains. A total of 475 whole-genome nucleotide sequences from South Africa submitted between December 1  2020 and February 15  2021 available at the GISAID database were retrieved based on its size  coverage level and hosts. To obtain the distribution of the clades and lineages of South African SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains  the metadata of the sequence retrieved were subjected to an epidemiological analysis. There was a prediction of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTL   Helper T cells  HTL  and B-cell epitopes. Furthermore  there was allergenicity  antigenicity and toxicity predictions on the epitopes. The analysis of the physicochemical properties of the vaccine construct was performed; the secondary structure  tertiary structure and B-cell 3D conformational structure of the vaccine construct were predicted. Also  molecular binding simulations and dynamics simulations were adopted in the prediction of the vaccine construct's stability and binding affinity with TLRs. Result obtained from the metadata analysis indicated lineage B.1.351 to be in higher circulation among various circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa and GH has the highest number of circulating clades. The construct of the novel vaccine was antigenic  non-allergenic and non-toxic. The Instability index  II  score and aliphatic index were estimated as 41.74 and 78.72 respectively. The computed half-life in mammalian reticulocytes was 4.4 h in vitro  for yeast and in E. coli was >20 h and >10 h in vivo respectively. The grand average of hydropathicity  GRAVY  score is estimated to be −0.129  signifying the hydrophilic nature of the protein. The molecular docking indicates that the vaccine construct has a high binding affinity towards the TLRs with TLR 3 having the highest binding energy  −1203.2 kcal mol  and TLR 9 with the lowest  −1559.5 kcal mol . These results show that the vaccine construct is promising and should be evaluated using animal model.

Motivated by a recent report showing estradiol-mediated downregulation of ACE2 in the airway epithelium 3 we hypothesized that the hormonal changes of pregnancy will decrease the expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry factors. Here  we compare their expression and examine the innate immune system in the nasal epithelium of term pregnant  gestational day 20  vs. non-pregnant 2-month old female rats Study Design All experiments were conducted after appropriate institutional approval  protocol ID:19-1071  and comply with ARRIVE guidelines. Briefly  nasal epithelia from euthanized rats  n=9 each  were dissected according to the protocol described by Dunston et al. with modifications.4 Collected samples were assayed for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors  Ace2  Tmprss2   innate antiviral immune genes that are highly co-expressed with Ace2  Tnfsf10  Mx1  Nos2  5 and genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 detection and defense  Rig-1  Tlr7  MyD88  Irf7  with TaqMan qPCR  ThermoFisher Scientific  Inc. . In addition  we determined the expression of ACE2  LS-c763699  LifeSpan BioSciences  Inc.; 1:1000 dilution  and TMPRSS2  sc-515727  Santa Cruz Biotechnology  Inc.; 1:250 dilution  protein with immunoblots. Finally  we assayed ACE2 enzyme activity with a fluorometric assay  K897-100  Biovision Inc. . Results We observed a marked downregulation of the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes  Fig 1A  along with concomitant changes in protein expression  1B   and a significant decrease in ACE2 enzyme activity in the nasal epithelium during pregnancy  1C . Innate immune genes with antiviral function that are highly co-expressed with Ace2  Tnfsf10  Mx1  Nos2  were significantly elevated in the nasal epithelium from pregnant rats  1D . Similarly  the expression of cytoplasmic  Rig-1  and endosomal viral sensors  Tlr7  MyD88  and Irf7  involved in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were substantially upregulated with pregnancy  1E . Collectively  our results show a decrease in cell entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 and a surprisingly robust expression of innate immune response genes in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats. Conclusion Based on our preclinical findings  we surmise that the high rate of asymptomatic infection in pregnant women is likely due to decreased SARS-CoV-2 tropism secondary to reduced expression of cell entry factors. Our observation of upregulated innate immune defense in the nasal epithelium  in contrast to the immunological indolence at the placental-fetal interface  was unexpected and novel. Considering the exquisite vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza A virus  another single-stranded RNA virus  but not SARS-CoV-2  our findings set the stage for comprehensive characterization of respiratory mucosal immunology in pregnant women to better understand host-pathogen interaction in this unique demographic subset.

Concerns around the impact on vaccine effectiveness  transmissibility and severity are now driving the public health response to these variants. This paper analyses the patterns of growth in hospitalisations and confirmed cases for novel VOCs by age groups  geography and ethnicity in the context of changing behaviour  non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  and the UK vaccination programme. We seek to highlight where strategies have been effective and periods that have facilitated the establishment of new variants. DESIGN: We have algorithmically linked the most complete testing and hospitalisation data in England to create a data set of confirmed infections and hospitalisations by SARS-CoV-2 genomic variant. We have used these linked data sets to analyse temporal  geographic and demographic distinctions. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The setting is England from October 2020 to July 2021. Participants included all COVID-19 tests that included RT-PCR CT gene target data or underwent sequencing and hospitalisations that could be linked to these tests. METHODS: To calculate the instantaneous growth rate for VOCs we have developed a generalised additive model fit to multiple splines and varying day of the week effects. We have further modelled the instantaneous reproduction number R t  for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 variants and included a doubly interval censored model to temporally adjust the confirmed variant cases. RESULTS: We observed a clear replacement of the predominant B.1.1.7 by the B.1.617.2 variant without observing sustained exponential growth in other novel variants. Modelled exponential growth of RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was initially detected in the youngest age groups  although we now observe across all ages a very small doubling time of 10.7  95% CI 9.1 to 13.2  days and 8  95% CI 6.9 to 9.1  days for cases and hospitalisations  respectively. We observe that growth in RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was first detected in the Indian ethnicity group in late February  with a peak of 0.06  95% CI 0.07 to 0.05  in the instantaneous growth rate  but is now maintained by the white ethnicity groups  observing a doubling time of 6.8  95% CI 4.9 to 11  days. R t  analysis indicates a reproduction number advantage of 0.45 for B.1.617.2 relative to B.1.1.7  with the R t  value peaking at 1.85 for B.1.617.2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate a clear transmission advantage for the B.1.617.2 variant and the growth in hospitalisations illustrates that this variant is able to maintain exponential growth within age groups that are largely doubly vaccinated. There are concerning signs of intermittent growth in the B.1.351 variant  reaching a 28-day doubling time peak in March 2021  although this variant is presently not showing any evidence of a transmission advantage over B.1.617.2. Step 1b of the UK national lockdown easing was sufficient to precipitate exponential growth in B.1.617.2 cases for most regions and younger adult age groups. The final stages of NPI easing appeared to have a negligible impact on the growth of B.1.617.2 with every region experiencing sustained exponential growth from step 2. Nonetheless  early targeted local NPIs appeared to markedly reduced growth of B.1.617.2. Later localised interventions  at a time of higher prevalence and greater geographic dispersion of this variant  appeared to have a negligible impact on growth.

This emphasizes the need for the strengthened surveillance system to limit the local transmission of this new variant.

In Sweden  at least 10% of all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced in each county; the B.1.717.2 + S:E484Q combination was not detected in Sweden before and was imported within the scenario described in this report. The high transmission rate of the delta lineage combined with the S:E484Q mutation  associated with immune escape in other lineages  makes this specific genetic combination a possible threat to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Even within the Omicron wave  the B.1.617.2 + S:E484Q variant appeared in community samples in Sweden  as it seems that this combination has an evolutionary gain compared to other B.1.617.2 lineages. The here described genomic combination was not detectable with the common fasta file-based Pango-lineage analysis  hence increasing the probability of the true global prevalence to be higher.

Until August 2021  12 variants of SARS-CoV-2 named as variants of concern  VOC; Alpha to Delta  or variants of interest  VOI; Epsilon to Mu   with significant impact on transmissibility  morbidity  possible reinfection and mortality  have been identified. The VOC Delta  B.1.617.2  of Indian origin is now the dominant and the most contagious variant worldwide as it provokes a strong binding to the human ACE2 receptor  increases transmissibility and manifests considerable immune escape strategies after natural infection or vaccination. Although the development and administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  based on different technologies  mRNA  adenovirus carrier  recombinant protein  etc.   are very promising for the control of the pandemic  their effectiveness and neutralizing activity against VOCs varies significantly. In this review  we describe the most significant circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2  and the known effectiveness of currently available vaccines against them.

As with other RNA viruses  mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene have been continuously evolving. Recently  four variants have been identified  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1 and CAL.20C. These variants appear to be more infectious and transmissible than the original Wuhan-Hu-1 virus. Using a combination of bioinformatics and structural analyses  we show that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of an already known Spike protein mutation D614G together with another mutation P323L in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CAL.20C and B.1.351 shared one common ancestor  whereas the B.1.1.7 and P.1 shared a different ancestor. Structural comparisons did not show any significant difference between the wild-type and mutant ACE2 Spike complexes. Structural analysis indicated that the N501Y mutation may increase hydrophobic interactions at the ACE2 Spike interface. However  reported greater binding affinity of N501Y Spike with ACE2 does not seem to be entirely due to increased hydrophobic interactions  given that Spike mutation R417T in P.1 or K417N in B.1.351 results in the loss of a salt-bridge interaction between ACE2 and S-RBD. The calculated change in free energy did not provide a clear trend of S protein stability of mutations in the variants. As expected  we show that the CAL.20C generally migrated from the west coast to the east coast of the USA. Taken together  the analyses suggest that the evolution of variants and their infectivity is complex and may depend upon many factors.

Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID‐19  cases surpassed 100 million on January 27  2021 according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University  which indicates that more than one of 80 humans on earth has already been infected. Some of the variants  especially the U.K. coronavirus variant  B.1.1.7   the South Africa variant  B.1.351   and the recently identified India variant  B.1.617  are more infectious and deadlier compared to SARS‐CoV‐2 before their appearance. The currently known major variants are characterized by mutations in the receptor‐binding domain of their spike‐protein  e.g.  N501Y  E484K  and K417T N ; the India variant has two characteristic mutations of E484Q and L452R that may impact vaccine efficacy. COVID‐19 is distinguished from other infectious diseases by its two‐faced clinical presentation: it is sometimes almost asymptomatic despite its transmission potential or it may present with pneumonia that can lead to rapid disease progression and fatal outcome.

We describe 44 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients  cycle threshold value <30  admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi between March 6 and April 15 2020. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these patients were sequenced using Illumina Miseq and analysed for common genetic variants and relationships to local and globally circulating strains. Results showed that 32 cases were Vietnamese with a median age of 37 years  range 15–74 years   and 23 were male. Most cases were acquired outside Vietnam  mainly from the UK  n = 15   other European countries  n = 14   Russia  n = 6  and countries in Asia  n = 3 . No cases had travelled from China. Forty-one cases had symptoms at admission  typically dry cough  n = 36   fever  n = 20   sore throat  n = 14  and diarrhoea  n = 12 . Hospitalisation was long with a median of 25 days  most commonly from 20–29 days. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar  92–100% sequence homology  to the reference sequence Wuhan_1  NC_045512   and 32 strains belonged to the B.1.1 lineage. The three most common variants were linked  and included C3037T  C14408T  nsp12: P323L  and A23403G  S: D614G  mutations. This group of mutations often accompanied variant C241T  39 44 genomes  or GGG 28881..28883 AAC  33 44 genomes . The prevalence of the former reflected probable European origin of viruses  and the transition D614G was dominant in Vietnam. New variants were identified; however  none could be associated with disease severity.

Mutations in Spike could affect efficacy of those treatments. Hence  monitoring of mutations is necessary to forecast and readapt the inventory of therapeutics. Different phylogenetic nomenclatures have been used for the currently circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 clades. The Spike protein has different hotspots of mutation and deletion  the most dangerous for immune escape being the ones within the receptor binding domain  RBD   such as K417N T  N439K  L452R  Y453F  S477N  E484K  and N501Y. Convergent evolution has led to different combinations of mutations among different clades. In this review we focus on the main variants of concern  that is  the so‐called UK  B.1.1.7   South African  B.1.351  and Brazilian  P.1  strains.

This lineage  which we refer to as B.1.x  COG-UK sometimes references similar samples as B.1.324.1   is present in at least 20 states across the USA and in at least six countries. However  a large deletion causes the sequence to be automatically rejected from repositories  suggesting that the frequency of this new lineage is underestimated using public data. Recent dynamics based on 339 samples obtained in Santa Cruz County  CA  USA suggest that B.1.x may be increasing in frequency at a rate similar to that of B.1.1.7 in Southern California. At present the functional differences between this variant B.1.x and other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are unknown  and further studies on secondary attack rates  viral loads  immune evasion and or disease severity are needed to determine if it poses a public health concern. Nonetheless  given what is known from well-studied circulating variants of concern  it seems unlikely that the lineage could pose larger concerns for human health than many already globally distributed lineages. Our work highlights a need for rapid turnaround time from sequence generation to submission and improved sequence quality control that removes submission bias. We identify promising paths toward this goal.

All were inpatients in a 48-bed geriatric rehabilitation ward  where a cluster of B.1.1.7  VOC-202012 1  variant COVID-19 cases occurred. We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG production in all patients. We observed patients who developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection  confirmed by RT-PCR  despite previous vaccination with mRNA vaccine. Results: Thirty vaccinated patients were enrolled. Mean age was 83 years and 60% were female. The IgG S-protein serology was positive in 16 of 18  89%  patients without cancer. Immunogenicity among patients with cancer was significantly lower with positive serology in only 7 of 12  58%  p<0.001 . Antibody level was also significantly lower in this group  mean 2946 AU mL vs. 4447 AU mL in controls  p<0.001 . Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 7 patients included 5 with cancer. Predictors for infection among older patients were: negative serology  haematological cancer  CLL or NHL   lung cancer  and treatment with high dose steroids. Covid-19 related deaths occurred in 5 patients included 4 with cancer. Conclusions: Routine measurement of post-vaccine antibodies in older patients with cancer should be considered. Novel strategies are needed to prevent COVID-19 in these individuals. Legal entity responsible for the study: T. Landre. Funding: Has not received any funding.

The World Health Organization  WHO  declared the Omicron as a variant of concern  VoC  because of the unexpected and large numbers of mutations occurred in the genome  higher viral transmission and immune evasions. The present study was performed to explore the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain  SGp RBD  of the three variants  Omicron  Delta  and WT  with the receptor hACE2. The structural changes occurred in Omicron due to the mutations at key positions improved the ability to mediate SARS-CoV-2 viral infection compared to other VoCs. The phytochemicals limonin and glycyrrhizic acid were docked with the SGp RBD of the variants WT  Delta and Omicron. The computed dock score revealed that limonin and glycyrrhizic acid binds effectively at the SGp RBD of all three variants  and showed almost similar binding affinity at the binding interface of ACE2. Therefore  despite the multiple mutations occurred in Omicron and its viral transmission is comparatively high  the computed binding affinity of the phytochemicals limonin and glycyrrhizic acid supported that the traditional medicines can be useful in formulating adjuvant therapies to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron.

Establishment of the highly immunogenic B-cell epitope profile of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in general  and that of the spike protein in particular  may contribute to the development of sensitive diagnostic tools and identification of vaccine` candidate targets. In the current study  the anti-viral antibody response in transgenic K18-hACE-2 mice was examined by implementing an immunodominant epitope mapping approach of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Serum samples for probing an epitope array covering the entire spike protein were collected from mice following infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as the B.1.1.7 Alpha and B.1.351 Beta genetic variants of concern. The analysis resulted in distinction of six linear epitopes common to the humoral response against all virus variants inspected at a frequency of more than 20% of the serum samples. Finally  the universality of the response was probed by cross-protective in vitro experiments using plaque-reducing neutralization tests. The data presented here has important implications for prediction of the efficacy of immune countermeasures against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Using structure-guided chimeric spike designs and multiplexed immunizations  we demonstrate protection against SARS-CoV  SARS-CoV-2  and bat CoV  BtCoV  RsSHC014 challenge in highly vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs containing N-terminal domain  NTD   and receptor binding domains  RBD  induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against three high-risk sarbecoviruses: SARS-CoV  RsSHC014  and WIV-1. In contrast  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a 10 to >500-fold reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous sarbecovirus strains  but SARS-CoV challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infection including measurable lung pathology. Importantly  chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized both the D614G and the South African B.1.351 variants of concern despite some reduction in neutralization activity. Thus  multiplexed-chimeric spikes may provide a novel strategy to prevent pandemic and SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections  while revealing the limited efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccines against other sarbecoviruses.

In addition  although the neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 is well established  the vaccine strategies currently developed have not taken into account protection of the central nervous system. Here  we generated a transgenic mouse strain expressing the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2  and displaying unprecedented brain permissiveness to SARS‐CoV‐2 replication  in addition to high permissiveness levels in the lung. Using this stringent transgenic model  we demonstrated that a non‐integrative lentiviral vector  encoding for the spike glycoprotein of the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2  used in intramuscular prime and intranasal boost elicits sterilizing protection of lung and brain against both the ancestral virus  and the Gamma  P.1  variant of concern  which carries multiple vaccine escape mutations. Beyond induction of strong neutralizing antibodies  the mechanism underlying this broad protection spectrum involves a robust protective T‐cell immunity  unaffected by the recent mutations accumulated in the emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.

Early reports suggest this variant has an increased growth rate suggesting increased transmissibility. This study indirectly assessed differences in transmissibility between the emergent Delta variant compared to the previously dominant Alpha variant  B.1.1.7 . METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted to estimate the odds of household transmission  ≥ 2 cases within 14 days  for Delta variant index cases compared with Alpha cases. Cases were derived from national surveillance data  March to June 2021 . One-to-two matching was undertaken on geographical location of residence  time period of testing and property type  and a multivariable conditional logistic regression model was used for analysis. FINDINGS: In total 5 976 genomically sequenced index cases in household clusters were matched to 11 952 sporadic index cases  single case within a household . 43.3%  n=2 586  of cases in household clusters were confirmed Delta variant compared to 40.4%  n= 4 824  of sporadic cases. The odds ratio of household transmission was 1.70 among Delta variant cases  95% CI 1.48-1.95  p <0.001  compared to Alpha cases after adjusting for age  sex  ethnicity  index of multiple deprivation  IMD   number of household contacts and vaccination status of index case. INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of increased household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant  potentially explaining its success at displacing Alpha variant as the dominant strain in England. With the Delta variant now having been detected in many countries worldwide  the understanding of the transmissibility of this variant is important for informing infection prevention and control policies internationally.

Our analysis  based on 333 genomes  revealed that the first variants detected in the state of Paraná in March 2020 were the B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 variants. The variants B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were predominant throughout 2020 until the introduction of the variant P.2 in August 2020 and a variant of concern  VOC   Gamma  P.1   in January 2021. The VOC Gamma  a ramification of the B.1.1.28 lineage first detected in Manaus  northern Brazil   has grown rapidly since December 2020 and was thought to be responsible for the deadly second wave of COVID-19 throughout Brazil. METHODS: The 333 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 to April 2021 were generated as part of the genomic surveillance carried out by Fiocruz in Brazil Genomahcov Fiocruz. SARS-CoV-2 sequencing was performed using representative samples from all geographic areas of Paraná. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the 333 genomes also included other SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the state of Paraná and other states in Brazil that were deposited in the GISAID. In addition  the time-scaled phylogenetic tree was constructed with up to 3 random sequences of the Gamma variant from each state in Brazil in each month of 2021. In this analysis we also added the sequences identified as the B.1.1.28 lineage of the Amazonas state and and the Gamma-like-II  P.1-like-II  lineage identified in different regions of Brazil. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were previously classified as the VOC Gamma lineage by WHO PANGO showed that some genomes from February to April 2021 branched in a monophyletic clade and that these samples grouped together with genomes recently described with the lineage Gamma-like-II. Additionally  a new mutation  E661D  in the spike  S  protein has been identified in nearly 10% of the genomes classified as the VOC Gamma from Paraná in March and April 2021.Finally  we analyzed the correlation between the lineage and the Gamma variant frequency  age group  patients younger or older than 60 years old  and the clinical data of 86 cases from the state of Paraná. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided a reliable picture of the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the state of Paraná characterized by the dominance of the Gamma strain  as well as a high frequencies of the Gamma-like-II lineage and the S:E661D mutation. Epidemiological and genomic surveillance efforts should be continued to unveil the biological relevance of the novel mutations detected in the VOC Gamma in Paraná.

Here  we report the emergence of the B.1.621 lineage  considered a variant of interest  VOI  with the accumulation of several substitutions affecting the Spike protein  including the amino acid changes I95I  Y144T  Y145S and the insertion 146 N in the N-terminal domain  R346K  E484K and N501Y in the Receptor Binding Domain and P681H in the S1 S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein. The rapid increase in frequency and fixation in a relatively short time in some cities that were near the theoretical herd immunity suggests an epidemiologic impact. Further studies will be required to assess the biological and epidemiologic roles of the substitution pattern found in the B.1.621 lineage.

Design Cohort study. Setting and Participants 418 residents from 18 nursing homes. Methods Blood RBD-IgG  IgG II Quant assay  Abbott Diagnostics; upper limit: 5680 BAU  and nucleocapsid-IgG  Abbott Alinity  were measured 21-28 days after the second BNT162b2 dose  as well as 1-3 days before and 21-28 days after the third vaccine dose. RBD-IgG levels ≥ 592 BAU mL were considered as high antibody response. Residents with prior positive RT-qPCR on a nasopharyngeal swab or with N-IgG levels above 0.8 S CO were considered as prior COVID-19 residents. Results In prior COVID-19 residents  n=122   RBD-IgG median levels decreased by 82% in 167 days on average. In the same period  the number of residents with a high antibody response decreased from 88.5% to 54.9%  p<.0001  and increased to 97.5% after the third vaccine dose  p=0.02 vs the first measure . In residents without prior COVID-19  n=296   RBD-IgG median levels decreased by 89% in 171 days on average. The number of residents with a high antibody response decreased from 29.4 to 1.7%  p<.0001  and increased to 88.4% after the third vaccine dose  p<.0001 vs the first measure  Conclusions and Implications The strong and rapid decay of RBD-IgG levels after the second BNT162b2 dose in all residents and the high antibody response after the third dose validate the recommendation of a third vaccine dose in residents less than 6 months after the second dose  prioritizing residents without prior COVID-19. The slope of RBD-IgG decay after the third BNT162b2 dose and the protection level against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529  omicron  and other variants of concern provided by the high post-boost vaccination RBD-IgG response require further investigation in residents.

Continuous monitoring of the virus has become a cornerstone to make rational decisions on implementing societal and sanitary measures to curtail the virus spread. Additionally  emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased the need for genomic surveillance to detect particular strains because of their potentially increased transmissibility  pathogenicity and immune escape. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of diagnostic and wastewater samples has been explored as an epidemiological surveillance method for the competent authorities. Currently  only the consensus genome sequence of the most abundant strain is taken into consideration for analysis  but multiple variant strains are now circulating in the population. Consequently  in diagnostic samples  potential co-infection s  by several different variants can occur or quasispecies can develop during an infection in an individual. In wastewater samples  multiple variant strains will often be simultaneously present. Currently  quality criteria are mainly available for constructing the consensus genome sequence  and some guidelines exist for the detection of co-infections and quasispecies in diagnostic samples. The performance of detection and quantification of low-frequency variants using whole genome sequencing  WGS  of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown. Here  we evaluated the detection and quantification of mutations present at low abundances using the mutations defining the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7  alpha variant  as a case study. Real sequencing data were in silico modified by introducing mutations of interest into raw wild-type sequencing data  or by mixing wild-type and mutant raw sequencing data  to construct mixed samples subjected to WGS using a tiling amplicon-based targeted metagenomics approach and Illumina sequencing. As anticipated  higher variation and lower sensitivity were observed at lower coverages and allelic frequencies. We found that detection of all low-frequency variants at an abundance of 10  5  3  and 1%  requires at least a sequencing coverage of 250  500  1500  and 10 000×  respectively. Although increasing variability of estimated allelic frequencies at decreasing coverages and lower allelic frequencies was observed  its impact on reliable quantification was limited. This study provides a highly sensitive low-frequency variant detection approach  which is publicly available at https:  galaxy.sciensano.be  and specific recommendations for minimum sequencing coverages to detect clade-defining mutations at certain allelic frequencies. This approach will be useful to detect and quantify low-frequency variants in both diagnostic  e.g.  co-infections and quasispecies  and wastewater [e.g.  multiple variants of concern  VOCs ] samples.

Taking advantage of Denmark's high RT-PCR testing and whole genome sequencing capacities  we used national health register data to assess the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals infected with B.1.1.7 compared with those with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: We did an observational cohort study of all SARS-CoV-2-positive cases confirmed by RT-PCR in Denmark  sampled between Jan 1 and March 24  2021  with 14 days of follow-up for COVID-19 hospitalisation. Cases were identified in the national COVID-19 surveillance system database  which includes data from the Danish Microbiology Database  RT-PCR test results   the Danish COVID-19 Genome Consortium  the National Patient Registry  the Civil Registration System  as well as other nationwide registers. Among all cases  COVID-19 hospitalisation was defined as first admission lasting longer than 12 h within 14 days of a sample with a positive RT-PCR result. The study population and main analysis were restricted to the proportion of cases with viral genome data. We calculated the risk ratio  RR  of admission according to infection with B.1.1.7 versus other co-existing lineages with a Poisson regression model with robust SEs  adjusted a priori for sex  age  calendar time  region  and comorbidities. The contribution of each covariate to confounding of the crude RR was evaluated afterwards by a stepwise forward inclusion. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and March 24  2021  50 958 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and at least 14 days of follow-up for hospitalisation were identified; 30 572  60·0%  had genome data  of whom 10 544  34·5%  were infected with B.1.1.7. 1944  6·4%  individuals had a COVID-19 hospitalisation and of these  571  29·4%  had a B.1.1.7 infection and 1373  70·6%  had an infection with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although the overall number of hospitalisations decreased during the study period  the proportion of individuals infected with B.1.1.7 increased from 3·5% to 92·1% per week. B.1.1.7 was associated with a crude RR of hospital admission of 0·79  95% CI 0·72–0·87; p<0·0001  and an adjusted RR of 1·42  95% CI 1·25–1·60; p<0·0001 . The adjusted RR was increased in all strata of age and calendar period—the two covariates with the largest contribution to confounding of the crude RR. INTERPRETATION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with that of other lineages in an analysis adjusted for covariates. The overall effect on hospitalisations in Denmark was lessened due to a strict lockdown  but our findings could support hospital preparedness and modelling of the projected impact of the epidemic in countries with uncontrolled spread of B.1.1.7. FUNDING: None.

The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS‐CoV‐2  variants has raised concerns of reduced sensitivity to neutralization by their elicited antibodies. We aimed to systematically review the most recent in vitro studies evaluating the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273 induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern. We searched PubMed  Scopus  and Web of Science in addition to bioRxiv and medRxiv with terms including ‘SARS‐CoV‐2’  ‘BNT162b2’  ‘mRNA‐1273’  and ‘neutralizing antibody’ up to June 29  2021. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials  CONSORT  checklist was used for assessing included study quality. A total 36 in vitro studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review. B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma   and B.1.617.2  Delta  are four SARS‐CoV‐2 variants that have recently been identified as variants of concern. Included studies implemented different methods regarding pseudovirus or live virus neutralization assays for measuring neutralization titres against utilized viruses. After two dose vaccination by BNT162b2 or mRNA‐1273  the B.1.351 variant had the least sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies  while B.1.1.7 variant had the most sensitivity; that is  it was better neutralized relative to the comparator strain. P.1 and B.1.617.2 variants had an intermediate level of impaired naturalization activity of antibodies elicited by prior vaccination. Our review suggests that immune sera derived from vaccinated individuals might show reduced protection of individuals immunized with mRNA vaccines against more recent SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern.

Many countries currently find themselves in a race to ramp up vaccination strategies that have been initiated and a possible third wave of the pandemic from new variants  such as the Variant of Concern-202012 01 from the B.1.1.7 lineage. Until today  many investigations in death cases of Coronavirus-disease-19 have been conducted  revealing pulmonary damage to be the predominant feature of the disease. Thereby  different degrees of macroscopic and microscopic lung damage have been reported  most of them resembling an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Far more  systemic complications of the disease such as pulmonary embolisms have been described. However  neither morphologic nor virologic findings of patients dying of the new variants have yet been reported. Here  we report on a comprehensive analysis of radiologic  morphologic  and virologic findings in a fatal case of this variant.

Despite a large number of infected people  particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern  VOC  Gamma  lineage P.1   SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier  we generated 1 188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021  of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus  P.1+  variants  designated Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6  harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal  NTD  domain  particularly Δ144 or Δ141-144  associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1 S2 junction  N679K or P681H  that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site  as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4  S:N679K  and P.1.6  S:P681H  expanded  Re > 1  from March to July 2021  the lineage P.1 declined  Re < 1  and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still  we did not find an increased incidence of P.1+ variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients  71%  in comparison to unvaccinated individuals  93% . This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma P.1 sublineages that are more transmissible  although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally  as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts  the risk of selecting more infectious variants or antibody evasion mutations is expected to increase. IMPORTANCE The continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is an expected phenomenon that will continue to happen due to the high number of cases worldwide. The present study analyzed how a Variant of Concern  VOC  could still circulate in a population hardly affected by two COVID-19 waves and with vaccination in progress. Our results showed that the answer behind that was a new generation of Gamma-like viruses  which emerged locally carrying mutations that made it more transmissible and more capable of spreading  partially evading prior immunity triggered by natural infections or vaccines. With thousands of new cases daily  the current pandemics scenario suggests that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve and efforts to reduce the number of infected subjects  including global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines  are mandatory. Thus  until the end of pandemics  the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance will be an essential tool to better understand the drivers of the viral evolutionary process.

We aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community. METHODS: Between Sept 13  2020  and Sept 15  2021  602 community contacts  identified via the UK contract-tracing system  of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta infection  n=29  with unvaccinated individuals with delta  n=16   alpha  B.1.1.7; n=39   and pre-alpha  n=49  infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological analysis were to assess the secondary attack rate  SAR  in household contacts stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases’ vaccination status. Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences in the peak viral load  viral growth rate  and viral decline rate between participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status. FINDINGS: The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25%  95% CI 18–33  for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38%  24–53  in unvaccinated individuals. The median time between second vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals  median 101 days [IQR 74–120]  than for uninfected individuals  64 days [32–97]  p=0·001 . SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases  25% [95% CI 15–35] for vaccinated vs 23% [15–31] for unvaccinated . 12  39%  of 31 infections in fully vaccinated household contacts arose from fully vaccinated epidemiologically linked index cases  further confirmed by genomic and virological analysis in three index case–contact pairs. Although peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or variant type  it increased modestly with age  difference of 0·39 [95% credible interval –0·03 to 0·79] in peak log 10  viral load per mL between those aged 10 years and 50 years . Fully vaccinated individuals with delta variant infection had a faster  posterior probability >0·84  mean rate of viral load decline  0·95 log 10  copies per mL per day  than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha  0·69   alpha  0·82   or delta  0·79  variant infections. Within individuals  faster viral load growth was correlated with higher peak viral load  correlation 0·42 [95% credible interval 0·13 to 0·65]  and slower decline  –0·44 [–0·67 to –0·18] . INTERPRETATION: Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless  fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings  including to fully vaccinated contacts. Host–virus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

These strains seem to be more easily transmissible than other variants  which may lead to more cases and more deaths. Currently  there are many vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 available in the market but without full clinical data beside. Despite the existence of these vaccines  the numbers of outpatients are still increasing in many countries around the world  and the reliability of these vaccines still remains elusive. It is well known that trace element deficiencies increase the individual susceptibility to immune dysfunction and lead to global health problem. In this context  improving the immune defense system to combats this pandemic is absolutely necessary. The purpose of this review is to establish the probable relation between trace elements supplementation and COVID-19. MAIN BODY: Several clinical studies confirmed that Cu  Se  and Zn insufficiencies alter the immune system and increase the vulnerability to viral infections. Based on antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of these micronutrients  it seems logical that dietary supplementations of these components might enhance human immune system and lower the graveness of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Based on available data  we hypothesize that the clinical use of some essential trace element supplementations such as copper  selenium  and zinc might be a preventive and promising option to enhance human immunity against the new pandemic COVID-19 and its new strains.

One of the key differences between these two assumptions was whether the virus actively replicated since  so far  no reports showed viruses could stop evolution in alive hosts. We studied SARS-CoV-2 sequences in this outbreak by a modified leaf-dating method with the Bayes factor. The numbers of single nucleotide variants  SNVs  found in SARS-CoV-2 sequences were significantly lower than those called from B.1.1 records collected at the matching time worldwide  p = 0.047 . In addition  results of the Leaf-dating method showed ages of viruses sampled from this outbreak were earlier than their recorded dates of collection  Bayes factors > 10   while control sequences  selected randomly with ten replicates  showed no differences in their collection dates  Bayes factors < 10 . Our results which indicated that the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing in June 2020 was caused by a virus that exhibited a lack of evolutionary changes compared to viruses collected at the corresponding time  provided evolutionary evidence to the contaminated imported frozen food should be responsible for the reappearance of COVID-19 cases in Beijing. The method developed here might also be helpful to provide the very first clues for potential sources of COVID-19 cases in the future.

Despite the implementation of aggressive measures to curb infection spread  gaps remain in the understanding of the clinical and epidemiologic features of the regional pandemic. METHODS: We did a retrospective  observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared demographic  clinical  laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19 severities on admission. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with disease severity and in-hospital death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 analysis was performed in 53 patients. FINDINGS: Of the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April 2020  the median age was 36 years  IQR 24–50  and 484  45%  were male. On admission  683  64%  participants had asymptomatic mild  341  32%  moderate  and 47  4%  severe-to-critical COVID-19 manifestation; 20 in-hospital deaths  1•87%  were reported by 5 May 2020. Multivariable regression indicated increasing odds of severe disease associated with older age  odds ratio 1•05  95% CI 1•03-1•07  per year increase; p<0•001   the presence of comorbidities  2•34  95% CI 1•18-4•85; p=0•017  and elevated white blood cell count  WBC  1•13  95% CI 1•00-1•27; p=0•044  on admission  while older age  1•09  95% CI 1•06-1•13  per year increase; p<0•001  and male sex  5•63  95% CI 2•06-17•57; p=0•001  were associated with increased odds of in-hospital death. The SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven phylogenetic lineages  O B.4.1  S A.2  S B.1.1  G B.1  GH B.1.255  GH B.1.3 and GR B.1.1.10; 87% of the isolates were O and S sub-types descending from early Asian lineages  while the G  GH and GR isolates were related to lineages from Europe and the Americas. INTERPRETATION: Older age  comorbidities  increased WBC count  and male sex were risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality in Kazakhstan. The broad SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests multiple importations and community-level amplification predating travel restriction. FUNDING: Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Here  we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera  mRNA vaccine-elicited sera  and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1  B.1.617.2  and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison  similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37  P.1  R.1  and B.1.526 pseudoviruses  but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera  respectively  were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested  four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally  the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants’ spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization  as well as fusogenic activity  which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.

Functional studies have shown omicron to substantially escape the activity of many SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Here we report a 3.1 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy  cryo-EM  structure of the omicron spike protein ectodomain. The structure depicts a spike that is exclusively in the 1-RBD-up conformation with high mobility of RBD. Many mutations cause steric clashes and or altered interactions at antibody binding surfaces  whereas others mediate changes of the spike structure in local regions to interfere with antibody recognition. Overall  the structure of the omicron spike reveals how mutations alter its conformation and explains its extraordinary ability to evade neutralizing antibodies.

In Indonesia  the B.1.1.7 cases have been found in several provinces since January 2021  although they are still in a lower number than the old variant of COVID-19. Therefore  this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021  and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the west java  south sumatra and east kalimantan. METHODS: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models  ARIMA  to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature  humidity  rainfall  sunshine  and wind speed. RESULTS: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces. The total cases in three provinces would increase by 36%  west java   13.5%  south sumatra   and 30%  east kalimantan  as compared with actual cases until the end of 14 days later. The temperature  rainfall and sunshine factors were the main contributors for B.1.1.7 cases with each correlation coefficients; r = -0.230; p < 0.05  r = 0.211; p < 0.05 and r = −0.418; p < 0.01  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We recapitulated that this investigation was the first preliminary study to analyze a short-term forecast regarding COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases as well as to determine the associated meteorological factors that become primary contributors to the virus spread.

The Obesity Society has critically evaluated data from published peer‐reviewed literature and briefing documents from Emergency Use Authorization applications submitted by Pfizer‐BioNTech  Moderna  and Johnson & Johnson. We conclude that these vaccines are highly efficacious  and their efficacy is not significantly different in people with and without obesity  based on scientific evidence available at the time of publication. The Obesity Society believes there is no definitive way to determine which of these three COVID‐19 vaccines is “best” for any weight subpopulation  because of differences in the trial design and outcome measures in the phase 3 trials  elapsed time between doses  and regional differences in the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants [e.g.  South Africa B.1.351 in Johnson & Johnson trial] .

The AusDiagnostics SARS-CoV-2  Influenza and RSV 8-well assay is used at sixteen UK hospitals and detects part of the ORF8 gene  together with a segment from the ORF1a gene . The objective of this study was to determine if the recently identified mutation in ORF8  G28048T  in the B.1.1.7. lineage could be used to identify the new variant quickly in clinical cases with PCR positive results. The melt data from SARS-CoV-2 positives from two hospitals  October through December 2020  were reviewed  and distribution over time and location was evaluated. A low melt variant of the ORF8 amplicon started to appear in samples from Guy's and St. Thomas’ NHS Trust  London  at the start of November  and grew as a proportion of the total positives during the subsequent two months. These low melt variants were very rare during the same period at the Northern Care Alliance  Greater Manchester  North West of UK. It was confirmed that these carried the G28048T mutation. The geographic and temporal distribution of the low melt amplicons makes it very likely that these are lineage B.1.1.7 strains. The melt temperature of this amplicon could be used to discriminate between the original and new variants in advance of the full sequencing of the isolate. However  the appearance of other mutations in the same amplicon means that this approach would be of diminishing value over time.

Unfortunately  massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations  including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here  we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein  A.1  from SARS-CoV-2  repRNA-CoV2S  in immunocompromised  SIV infected and immune competent  naïve pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naïve animals. Furthermore  vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals.

We aimed to evaluate seroconversion  cross-neutralisation and T-cell responses induced by BNT162b2 in immunocompromised patients with systemic inflammatory diseases. METHODS: Prospective monocentric study including patients with systemic inflammatory diseases and healthcare immunocompetent workers as controls. Primary endpoints were anti-spike antibodies levels and cross-neutralisation of Alpha and Delta variants after BNT162b2 vaccine. Secondary endpoints were T-cell responses  breakthrough infections and safety. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases and 21 controls not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were analysed. Kinetics of anti-spike IgG after BNT162b2 vaccine showed lower and delayed induction in cases  more pronounced with rituximab. Administration of two doses of BNT162b2 generated a neutralising response against Alpha and Delta in 100% of controls  while sera from only one of rituximab-treated patients neutralised Alpha  5%  and none Delta. Other therapeutic regimens induced a partial neutralising activity against Alpha  even lower against Delta. All controls and cases except those treated with methotrexate mounted a SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response. Methotrexate abrogated T-cell responses after one dose and dramatically impaired T-cell responses after two doses of BNT162b2. Third dose of vaccine improved immunogenicity in patients with low responses. CONCLUSION: Rituximab and methotrexate differentially impact the immunogenicity of BNT162b2  by impairing B-cell and T-cell responses  respectively. Delta fully escapes the humoral response of individuals treated with rituximab. These findings support efforts to improve BNT162b2 immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals  ClinicalTrials.gov number  NCT04870411 .

The viral genome data show that the COVID-19 curves of daily case numbers were shaped by the emergence of the variants  including Alpha 202012 01 GRY  B.1.1.7; the U.K.   Beta GH 501Y.V2  B.1.351  B.1.351.2  and B.1.351.3; South Africa   Gamma GR 501Y.V3  P.1  P.1.1  and P.1.2; Japan  Brazil   Eta G 484K.V3  B.1.525; Nigeria  the U.K.   Delta G 478K.V1  B.1.617.2  AY.1  AY.2  and AY.3; India   Iota GH 253G.V1  B.1.526; the U.S.A.   and Kappa G 452R.V3  B.1.617.1; India . The Lambda  C.37  variant was reported in Peru initially; this has spread to 41 countries in four continents. Seven out of eight mutations in this variant are associated with the viral spike protein  akin to mutations in the other variants. These mutations have implications for effectiveness of the vaccines and neutralizing antibodies in immunized subjects and those previously infected with the virus and are thought to facilitate the viral invasion into host cells and help the virus evade the host immune system. Widespread dissemination of the viral variants may cause severe clinical consequences  lengthy hospitalizations  and unfavorable prognoses. Healthcare systems will be stretched  and health workers will be fatigued. Fast  equitable  and widespread vaccination with strict adherence to hygiene protocols will control the rising curves of the pandemic due to the new variants.

The recent emergence and rapid spread of several SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying multiple Spike mutations raise concerns about possible immune escape. One variant  first identified in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7  also called 501Y.V1 or 20I   contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy  vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we show that B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization  albeit at moderately reduced levels  ∼2-fold   by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of an mRNA vaccine  mRNA-1273   Moderna  and a protein nanoparticle vaccine  NVX-CoV2373  Novavax . A subset of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain  RBD  of Spike are less effective against the variant while others are largely unaffected. These findings indicate that variant B.1.1.7 is unlikely to be a major concern for current vaccines or for an increased risk of reinfection.

It is unclear whether boosting with Omicron-matched vaccines would enhance protection. Here  nonhuman primates that received mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 were boosted at week 41 with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron. Neutralizing titers against D614G were 4760 and 270 reciprocal ID50 at week 6  peak  and week 41  pre-boost   respectively  and 320 and 110 for Omicron. Two weeks after boost  titers against D614G and Omicron increased to 5360 and 2980 for mRNA-1273 boost and 2670 and 1930 for mRNA-Omicron. Similar increases against BA.2 were observed. Following either boost  70-80% of spike-specific B cells were cross-reactive against WA1 and Omicron. Equivalent control of virus replication in lower airways was observed following Omicron challenge one month after either boost. These data show that mRNA-1273 and mRNA-Omicron elicit comparable immunity and protection shortly after the boost.

A detailed dynamic and energetic analysis of these variants was undertaken in the present work to quantify the effects of different mutations on functional conformational changes and stability of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We employed the efficient and accurate coarse-grained  CG  simulations of multiple functional states of the D614G mutant  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike variants to characterize conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and identify dynamic signatures of the functional regions that regulate transitions between the closed and open forms. By combining molecular simulations with full atomistic reconstruction of the trajectories and the ensemble-based mutational frustration analysis  we characterized how the intrinsic flexibility of specific spike regions can control functional conformational changes required for binding with the host-cell receptor. Using the residue-based mutational scanning of protein stability  we determined protein stability hotspots and identified potential energetic drivers favoring the receptor-accessible open spike states for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike variants. The results suggested that modulation of the energetic frustration at the inter-protomer interfaces can serve as a mechanism for allosteric couplings between mutational sites and the inter-protomer hinges of functional motions. The proposed mechanism of mutation-induced energetic frustration may result in greater adaptability and the emergence of multiple conformational states in the open form. This study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants may leverage the intrinsic plasticity of functional regions in the spike protein for mutation-induced modulation of protein dynamics and allosteric regulation to control binding with the host cell receptor.

Monoclonal antibodies used in the clinic have varying efficacies against distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants; thus  there is considerable interest in engineered ACE2 peptides with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These could have therapeutic benefit against multiple viral variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations  we show how three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 peptide  sACE2 2 .v2.4-IgG1  markedly increase affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike  S  protein. We demonstrate high binding affinity to S protein of the early SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 2020 isolate and also to multiple variants of concern: B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma   and B.1.617.2  Delta  SARS-CoV-2 variants. In humanized K18-hACE2 mice  prophylactic and therapeutic administration of sACE2 2 .v2.4-IgG1 peptide prevented acute lung vascular endothelial injury and lung edema  essential features of ARDS  and significantly improved survival after infection by SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 2020 as well as P.1 variant of concern. These studies demonstrate for the first time broad efficacy in vivo of an ACE2 decoy peptide against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and point to its therapeutic potential.

We show that the large number of BA.1 and BA.2 spike mutations severely dampen plasma neutralizing activity elicited by infection or seven clinical vaccines  with cross-neutralization of BA.2 being consistently more potent than that of BA.1  independent of the vaccine platform and number of doses. Although mRNA vaccines induced the greatest magnitude of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 plasma neutralizing activity  administration of a booster based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence markedly increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against BA.1 and BA.2 across all vaccines evaluated. Our data suggest that although BA.1 and BA.2 evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses  current vaccine boosting regimens may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced disease.

Previously  we used a structural design approach to develop picomolar range miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. Here  we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead miniprotein  LCB1  to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden  diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation  and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung when given as many as five days before or two days after virus inoculation. Importantly  LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain  WA1 2020   an emerging B.1.1.7 strain  and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions. These data support development of LCB1v1.3 for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome might allow identification of variants with increased contagiousness  different clinical patterns and or different response to vaccines. A highly automated next generation sequencing  NGS -based method might facilitate an active genomic surveillance of the virus. METHODS: RNA was extracted from 27 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from citizens of the Italian Campania region in March–April 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Following viral RNA quantification  sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel on the Genexus Integrated Sequencer  an automated technology for library preparation and sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes were built using the pipeline SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY  REconstruction of COronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis  and analysed by IQ-TREE software. RESULTS: The complete genome  100%  of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully obtained for 21 27 samples. In particular  the complete genome was fully sequenced for all 15 samples with high viral titer  > 200 copies µl   for the two samples with a viral genome copy number < 200 but greater than 20  and for 4 10 samples with a viral load < 20 viral copies. The complete genome sequences classified into the B.1 and B.1.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. In comparison to the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1  48 total nucleotide variants were observed with 26 non-synonymous substitutions  18 synonymous and 4 reported in untranslated regions  UTRs . Ten of the 26 non-synonymous variants were observed in ORF1ab  7 in S  1 in ORF3a  2 in M and 6 in N genes. CONCLUSIONS: The Genexus system resulted successful for SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequencing  also in cases with low viral copies. The use of this highly automated system might facilitate the standardization of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocols and make faster the identification of novel variants during the pandemic.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation as part of routine surveillance. Nucleic acid amplification testing was performed on the two samples to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection  and serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Comparative genome analysis with whole-genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the two episodes of COVID-19. The first COVID-19 episode was in March 2020  and the second was in January 2021. Both SARS-CoV-2 infections presented with mild symptoms  and seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 IgG was documented. Genomic analysis showed that the viral genome from the first infection belonged to the lineage B.1.1.74  while that from the second infection to the lineage B.1.177. Epidemiological  clinical  serological  and genomic analyses confirmed that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the healthcare worker met the qualifications for “best evidence” for reinfection. Further studies are urgently needed to assess the frequency of such a worrisome occurrence  particularly in the light of the recent diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant  and to discuss the mediating role of positive coping style between resilience and anxiety  and the moderating role of general self-efficacy. METHOD: Connor-Davidson Resilience scale  CD-RISC   Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale  GAD-7   General Self-efficacy Scale  GSES  and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire  SCSQ  were used in this cross-sectional study among 390 healthcare workers in Jiangsu Province  China. Mackinnon's four-step procedure was applied to test the mediation effect  and Hayes PROCESS macro was conducted to examine the moderated mediation model. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety among Chinese healthcare workers during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was 41.8%. Male  unmarried  childless and younger subjects reported higher levels of anxiety. Positive coping partially mediated the effect of resilience on anxiety among healthcare workers and the indirect effect was stronger with the increase of general self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety was prevalent among healthcare workers during the spread of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. This research sheds new light on the potential mechanism underlying the association between resilience and anxiety and provides new insight into the prevention of anxiety among healthcare workers during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.

COVID-19 can result in fatal comorbidities  including acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS . Several reports suggest that children have milder illness  though severe cases have still been reported. We report a 9-year-old boy with ARDS caused by the SARS-CoV-2 delta  B.1.617.2  variant. He was admitted to our hospital and carefully observed due to underlying Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. He developed intractable seizures with a high fever. Although the seizures were controlled  his respiratory condition deteriorated to severe ARDS. High-dose methylprednisolone was administered with high positive end-expiratory pressure and low tidal volume. After ARDS treatment  oxygenation improved sufficiently to permit extubation. This case suggests that close observation is required in pediatric patients with neurologic comorbidities because of an increased risk for severe COVID-19.

Genomic surveillance of the virus has proven to be a critical tool for tracking the emergence and spread of variants with increased transmission or immune evasion potential. Despite the global distribution of infection  differences in viral genomic surveillance capabilities between countries and regions have resulted in gaps in our understanding of the viral population dynamics underlying the pandemic. Nigeria  despite having the largest population of any country in Africa  has had relatively little SARS-CoV-2 sequence data made publicly available. In this study  we report the whole-genome sequences of 74 SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from individuals in Oyo State  Nigeria over the first two weeks of January 2021. Forty-six of the isolates belong to the B.1.1.7 “UK variant” lineage. Comparison to available regional and global sequences suggest that the B.1.1.7 isolates in Nigeria are primarily monophyletic  possibly representing a singular successful introduction into the country. The majority of the remaining isolates  17 of 74  belong to the B.1.525 lineage  which contains multiple spike protein mutations  including the E484K mutation associated with potential immune escape. Indeed  Nigeria has the highest reported frequency of this lineage despite its relative rarity worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of the B.1.525 isolates in this study relative to other local and global isolates suggested a recent origin and rapid expansion of this lineage in Nigeria  with the country serving as a potential source for this lineage in other outbreaks. These results demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Nigeria and in other undersampled regions across the globe.

Additional mutations are found in these variants at residues 417 and 484 that appear to promote antibody evasion. In contrast  the Epsilon variants  B.1.427 429  lack the N501Y mutation  yet exhibit antibody evasion. We have engineered spike proteins to express these RBD VoC mutations either in isolation  or in different combinations  and analyze the effects using biochemical assays and cryo-EM structural analyses. Overall  our findings suggest that the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variant spikes can be rationalized as the result of mutations that confer either increased ACE2 affinity  increased antibody evasion  or both  providing a framework to dissect the molecular factors that drive VoC evolution.
doi:10.3390/e23050512,Semicovariance Coefficient Analysis of Spike Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses for Viral Evolution and Characteristics Associated with Fatality,doi:10.3390/e23050512,https://doi.org/10.3390/e23050512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922613/,pubmed:33922613,pmc:PMC8146220,Entropy (Basel),2021,Semicovariance Coefficient Analysis of Spike Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses for Viral Evolution and Characteristics Associated with Fatality,Complex modeling has received significant attention in recent years and is increasingly used to explain statistical phenomena with increasing and decreasing fluctuations  such as the similarity or difference of spike protein charge patterns of coronaviruses. Different from the existing covariance or correlation coefficient methods in traditional integer dimension construction  this study proposes a simplified novel fractional dimension derivation with the exact Excel tool algorithm. It involves the fractional center moment extension to covariance  which results in a complex covariance coefficient that is better than the Pearson correlation coefficient  in the sense that the nonlinearity relationship can be further depicted. The spike protein sequences of coronaviruses were obtained from the GenBank and GISAID databases  including the coronaviruses from pangolin  bat  canine  swine  three variants   feline  tiger  SARS-CoV-1  MERS  and SARS-CoV-2  including the strains from Wuhan  Beijing  New York  German  and the UK variant B.1.1.7  which were used as the representative examples in this study. By examining the values above and below the average mean based on the positive and negative charge patterns of the amino acid residues of the spike proteins from coronaviruses  the proposed algorithm provides deep insights into the nonlinear evolving trends of spike proteins for understanding the viral evolution and identifying the protein characteristics associated with viral fatality. The calculation results demonstrate that the complex covariance coefficient analyzed by this algorithm is capable of distinguishing the subtle nonlinear differences in the spike protein charge patterns with reference to Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2  which the Pearson correlation coefficient may overlook. Our analysis reveals the unique convergent  positive correlative  to divergent  negative correlative  domain center positions of each virus. The convergent or conserved region may be critical to the viral stability or viability; while the divergent region is highly variable between coronaviruses  suggesting high frequency of mutations in this region. The analyses show that the conserved center region of SARS-CoV-1 spike protein is located at amino acid residues 900  but shifted to the amino acid residues 700 in MERS spike protein  and then to amino acid residues 600 in SARS-COV-2 spike protein  indicating the evolution of the coronaviruses. Interestingly  the conserved center region of the spike protein in SARS-COV-2 variant B.1.1.7 shifted back to amino acid residues 700  suggesting this variant is more virulent than the original SARS-COV-2 strain. Another important characteristic our study reveals is that the distance between the divergent mean and the maximal divergent point in each of the viruses  MERS > SARS-CoV-1 > SARS-CoV-2  is proportional to viral fatality rate. This algorithm may help to understand and analyze the evolving trends and critical characteristics of SARS-COV-2 variants  other coronaviral proteins and viruses.

Multiple mutations in the spike protein of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 appear to impact on the effectiveness of available vaccines. Specific antiviral agents are keenly anticipated but their efficacy may also be compromised in emerging variants. One of the most attractive coronaviral drug targets is the main protease  M pro  . A promising M pro  inhibitor of clinical relevance is the peptidomimetic nirmatrelvir  PF-07321332 . We expressed M pro  of six SARS-CoV-2 lineages  C.37 Lambda  B.1.1.318  B.1.2  B.1.351 Beta  B.1.1.529 Omicron  P.2 Zeta   each of which carries a strongly prevalent missense mutation  G15S  T21I  L89F  K90R  P132H  L205V . Enzyme kinetics reveal that these M pro  variants are catalytically competent to a similar degree as the wildtype. We show that nirmatrelvir has similar potency against the variants as the wildtype. Our in vitro data suggest that the efficacy of the specific M pro  inhibitor nirmatrelvir is not compromised in current COVID-19 variants.

Evaluation of Three COVID-19 Monoclonal Antibody Regimens in the Context of Rising B.1.526 Prevalence in New York City,BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies were given emergency use authorization  EUA  by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of high-risk  outpatient COVID-19 infection. In New York City  NYC   the emergence and rapid growth of the B.1.526 variant of concern  VOC  possessing the E484K mutation was first noted in February 2021. In-vitro studies subsequently confirmed attenuated monoclonal antibody neutralization against VOCs. At our institution  bamlanivimab  BAM  alone or with etesevimab  B E  and casirivimab imdevimab  C I  were utilized at different phases of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess their comparative efficacies in a highly variant prevalent setting. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted at an urban hospital in the Bronx  NY and evaluated adult monoclonal antibody recipients from any of our infusion sites. Patients initially received BAM but given the high prevalence of variants  treatment was transitioned to first B E and then C I exclusively. We compared BAM versus combination therapy as well as B E versus C I individually. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital admission within 30 days post infusion. RESULTS: From February 1 to March 7  2021  358 patients received BAM and from March 17 to May 9  2021  86 and 179 patients received B E and C I  respectively. Compared to any combination infusion  patients who received BAM were significantly older  more likely to possess ≥ 2 qualifying EUA criteria  and less likely to be vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to infusion  Table 1 . Following B E and C I  4.5% of patients were admitted versus 10.1% for BAM  p=0.011. There were no significant differences in admission between B E and C I recipients  p=0.485. After excluding fully vaccinated patients  n=14  and adjusting for age and ≥ 2 EUA criteria  combination therapy remained associated with decreased odds of hospitalization compared to BAM  odds ratio  0.48; 95% confidence interval  0.24-0.94 . [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Combination therapy may be associated with fewer hospital admissions following infusion  although there were no statistically significant differences between the individual combination infusions. We suggest similar studies be conducted by other sites to understand the clinical impact of local SARS-CoV-2 variants on antibody efficacy.

Three-quarters of the welfare benefit of the vaccine can be achieved with a speed of 100 000 full vaccination per day. A 1-week delay in the vaccination campaign raises the death toll by approximately 2500  and it reduces wealth by 8 billion euros. Because of the large heterogeneity of the rates of hospitalization and mortality across age classes  it is critically important for the number of lives saved and for the economy to vaccinate older people first. Any departure from this policy has a welfare cost. Prioritizing the allocation of vaccines to the most vulnerable people save 70 000 seniors  but it also increases the death toll of younger people by 14 000. Vaccine nationalism is modeled by assuming two identical Frances  one with a vaccine production capacity and the other without it. If the production country vaccinates its entire population before exporting to the other  the global death toll would be increased by 20 %. I also measure the welfare impact of the strong French anti-vax movement  and of the prohibition of an immunity passport.

Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 from occupational exposure to COVID-19 virus during their daily medical service work. Excellent infection prevention and control measures and adequate personal protective equipment  PPE  are essential to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19. WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? On March 17  2021  a female healthcare professional who already received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination and was working in the isolation area of a designated COVID-19 hospital was diagnosed with COVID-19 in Xi’an city. Her exposure likely occurred five days before illness onset when she obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the two imported cases that were identified as belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage  the variant first detected in the United Kingdom. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICES? Since the healthcare worker had been fully vaccinated and had mild symptomatology  it is considered a mild breakthrough infection. All vaccines are associated with breakthrough infections. In addition to rigorous adherence to infection prevention and control measures  use of adequate PPE  and using good clinical practices  the potential role of chronic upper respiratory infection in acquiring COVID-19 during medical procedures deserves further consideration.

Methods: Whole genome sequencing was carried out on diagnostic sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs from 373 patients with COVID-19. Molecular clock phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to further explore dominant lineages. Results: The B.1.411 lineage was most prevalent  which was established in Sri Lanka and caused outbreaks throughout the country until March 2021. The estimated time of the most recent common ancestor  tMRCA  of this lineage was June 1  2020  with 95% lower and upper bounds March 30 to July 27  suggesting cryptic transmission may have occurred  prior to a large epidemic starting in October 2020. Returning travellers were identified with infections caused by lineage B.1.258  as well as the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage  which has replaced B.1.411 to fuel the ongoing large outbreak in the country. Conclusions: The large outbreak that started in early October  is due to spread of a single virus lineage  B.1.411 until the end of March 2021  when B.1.1.7 emerged and became the dominant lineage.

We aimed to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: This prospective  cohort study  Nor-vaC  was done at two hospitals in Norway. For this sub-study  we enrolled patients with rheumatoid arthritis on rituximab treatment and healthy controls who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the Norwegian national vaccination programme. Patients with insufficient serological responses to two doses  antibody to the receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein concentration <100 arbitrary units [AU] mL  were allotted a third vaccine dose. Antibodies to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured in serum 2–4 weeks after the second and third doses. Vaccine-elicited T-cell responses were assessed in vitro using blood samples taken before and 7–10 days after the second dose and 3 weeks after the third dose from a subset of patients by stimulating cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike protein peptides. The main outcomes were the proportions of participants with serological responses  anti-RBD antibody concentrations of ≥70 AU mL  and T-cell responses to spike peptides following two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04798625  and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Feb 9  2021  and May 27  2021  90 patients were enrolled  87 of whom donated serum and were included in our analyses  69 [79·3%] women and 18 [20·7%] men . 1114 healthy controls were included  854 [76·7%] women and 260 [23·3%] men . 49 patients were allotted a third vaccine dose. 19  21·8%  of 87 patients  compared with 1096  98·4%  of 1114 healthy controls  had a serological response after two doses  p<0·0001 . Time since last rituximab infusion  median 267 days [IQR 222–324] in responders vs 107 days [80–152] in non-responders  and vaccine type  mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2  were significantly associated with serological response  adjusting for age and sex . After two doses  10  53%  of 19 patients had CD4 +  T-cell responses and 14  74%  had CD8 +  T-cell responses. A third vaccine dose induced serological responses in eight  16·3%  of 49 patients  but induced CD4 +  and CD8 +  T-cell responses in all patients assessed  n=12   including responses to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  B.1.617.2 . Adverse events were reported in 32  48%  of 67 patients and in 191  78%  of 244 healthy controls after two doses  with the frequency not increasing after the third dose. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. INTERPRETATION: This study provides important insight into the divergent humoral and cellular responses to two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in rituximab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A third vaccine dose given 6–9 months after a rituximab infusion might not induce a serological response  but could be considered to boost the cellular immune response.

Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2  whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study  sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike  S  and anti-Nucleocapsid  NP  IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months  2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However  all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity  notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition  sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G  B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G  B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.

Our objective was to describe MIS-C cases reported to CDC’s national surveillance since the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHODS: We included patients meeting the MIS-C case definition with onset date from February 19  2020 through July 31  2021  using CDC’s MIS-C case report form  which collects information on demographics  clinical presentation  and laboratory results. Trends over time across 3 MIS-C pandemic waves were assessed using Cochran-Armitage test for categorical and Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of 4 901 reported cases  4 470 met inclusion criteria. Median patient age increased over time  P<0.001   with a median of 9 years  interquartile range  5–13 years  during the most recent  third  wave. Male predominance also increased  62% in third wave  P<0.001 . A significant  P<0.001  increase in severe hematologic and gastrointestinal involvement was observed across the study period. Frequency of several cardiovascular complications  i.e.  cardiac dysfunction  myocarditis  and shock  vasopressor receipt  and renal failure declined  P<0.001 . Provision of critical care including mechanical ventilation  P<0.001  and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO; P=0.046  decreased  as did duration of hospitalization and mortality  each P<0.001 . CONCLUSIONS: Over the first 3 pandemic waves of MIS-C in the United States  cardiovascular complications and clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization  receipt of ECMO  and death decreased over time. These data serve as a baseline for monitoring future trends associated with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  or other variants and increased COVID-19 vaccination among children.

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant of concern is more transmissible than previously identified variants * and as of September 2021  is the predominant variant in the United States. Studies characterizing the distribution and severity of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants  particularly the Delta variant  are limited in the United States  3   and are subject to limitations related to study setting  specimen collection  study population  or study period  4-7 . This study used whole genome sequencing  WGS  data on SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens collected across Kaiser Permanente Southern California  KPSC   a large integrated health care system  to describe the distribution and risk of hospitalization associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants during March 4-July 21  2021  by patient vaccination status. Among 13 039 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens identified from KPSC patients during this period  6 798  52%  were sequenced and included in this report. Of these  5 994  88%  were collected from unvaccinated persons  648  10%  from fully vaccinated persons  and 156  2%  from partially vaccinated persons. Among all sequenced specimens  the weekly percentage of B.1.1.7  Alpha  variant infections increased from 20% to 67% during March 4-May 19  2021. During April 15-July 21  2021  the weekly percentage of Delta variant infections increased from 0% to 95%. During March 4-July 21  2021  the weekly percentage of variants was similar among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons  but the Delta variant was more commonly identified among vaccinated persons then unvaccinated persons overall  relative to other variants. The Delta variant was more prevalent among younger persons  with the highest percentage  55%  identified among persons aged 18-44 years. Infections attributed to the Delta variant were also more commonly identified among non-Hispanic Black persons  relative to other variants. These findings reinforce the importance of continued monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants and implementing multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies  particularly during the current period in which Delta is the predominant variant circulating in the United States.

Here  we analyzed the frequency of Q677P H and FCS point mutations in 1 144 793 human and 1042 animal spike protein sequences and from those of the emergent variants B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.429 + B.1.427  and B.1.525  which were deposited in the database of the GISAID Initiative. Different genetic polymorphisms  particularly P681H and A688V  were detected in the FCS  mainly in human isolates  and otherwise  only pangolin and bat sequences had these mutations. Multiple FCS amino acid deletions such as Δ 680 SPRRA 684  and Δ 685 RSVA 688  were only detected in eight and four human isolates  respectively. Surprisingly  deletion of the entire FCS motif as Δ 680 SPRRARSVA 688  and Δ 680 SPRRARSVAS 689  was detected only in three human isolates. On the other hand  analysis of FCS from emergent variants showed no deletions in the FCS except for spike P681del  which was detected in seven B.1.1.7 isolates from the USA. Spike Q677P was detected only once in variant  B.1.1.7  whereas Q677H was detected in all variants  i.e.  B.1.1.7  n = 1938   B.1.351  n = 28   P.1  n = 9   B.1.429 + B.1.427  n = 132   and B.1.525  n = 1584 . Structural modeling predicted that mutations or deletions at or near the FCS significantly alter the cleavage loop structure and would presumably affect furin binding. Taken together  our results show that Q677H and FCS point mutations are prevalent and may have various biological effects on the circulating variants. Therefore  we recommend urgent monitoring and surveillance of the investigated mutations  as well as laboratory assessment of their pathogenicity and transmissibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the distribution  prevalence  and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Brazzaville  the Republic of Congo  ROC . Methods Between December 2020 and July 2021  a total of n=600 oropharyngeal specimens collected in the community were tested for COVID-19. Of the samples tested  317  53%  were SARS-CoV-2 positive. All samples that had a threshold of Ct <30  n=182  was sequenced by next-generation sequencing  NGS   and all complete sequenced genomes were submitted to GISAID  and lineages were assigned using pangolin nomenclature and a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed. In addition  the global prevalence of the predominant lineages was analysed using data from GISAID and Outbreak databases. Results A total of 15 lineages circulated with B.1.214.2  26%   B.1.214.1  19%  and B.1.620  18%  being the predominant. The variants of concern  VOC  alpha  B.1.1.7   6%  and for the first time in June delta  B.1.617.2   4%  were observed. In addition  the B.1.214.1 lineage first reported from ROC was observed to be spreading locally and regionally. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the B.1.620 variant  VUM  under observation may have originated from either Cameroon or the Central African Republic. SARS-CoV-2 lineages were heterogeneous  with the densely populated districts of Poto-Poto and Moungali likely the epicenter of spread. Conclusion Longitudinal monitoring and molecular surveillance across time and space are critical to understanding viral phylodynamics  which could have important implications for transmissibility and impact infection prevention and control measures.

However  SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly spreading worldwide from the sites of initial identification. The variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma  and B.1.167.2  Delta  showed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein potentially able to cause escape from nAb responses with a consequent reduction of efficacy of vaccines and mAbs-based therapy. We produced the recombinant RBD  rRBD  of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the Wuhan-Hu 1 reference sequence in a mammalian system  for mice immunization to isolate new mAbs with neutralizing activity. Here we describe four mAbs that were able to bind the rRBD in Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and the transmembrane full-length spike protein expressed in HEK293T cells by flow cytometry assay. Moreover  the mAbs recognized the RBD in supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected VERO E6 cells by Western Blot under non-reducing condition or in supernatants of cells infected with lentivirus pseudotyped for spike protein  by immunoprecipitation assay. Three out of four mAbs lost their binding efficiency to completely N-deglycosylated rRBD and none was able to bind the same recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli  suggesting that the epitopes recognized by three mAbs are generated by the conformational structure of the glycosylated native protein. Of particular relevance  three mAbs were able to inhibit Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO E6 cells in a plaque-reduction neutralization test and the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Alpha  Beta  Gamma and Delta VOC in a pseudoviruses-based neutralization test. These mAbs represent important additional tools for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19 and may contribute to the understanding of the functional structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

The B.1.351 variant carrying the escape mutation E484K in the receptor binding domain is of particular concern due to reduced immunological protection following vaccination. Protection can manifest as early as 10 days following immunization with full protection two weeks following the second dose  but the course is not well-characterized for variants. Here  we investigated the immune transcriptome of six elderly individuals  average age 82 yr.  from an old people’s home  who contracted B.1.351  with four having received the first dose of BNT162b eight to 11 days prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patients were hospitalized and received dexamethasone treatment. Immune transcriptomes were established from PBMCs approximately 10 and 35 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptomology. RNA-seq revealed a more intensive immune response in vaccinated patients as compared to unvaccinated ones. Specifically  transcription factors linked to the JAK STAT pathway  interferon stimulated genes  and genes associated with innate antiviral immunity and COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2 infection were highly enriched in vaccinated patients. This rendered the transcriptomes of the older vaccinated group significantly different than older unvaccinated individuals infected at the same institution and more similar to the immune response of younger unvaccinated individuals  age range 48–62  following B.1.351 infection. All individuals in this study whether vaccinated or not were hospitalized due to B.1.351 infection and one vaccinated patient died illustrating that although an enhanced immune response was documented infection it was insufficient to protect from disease. This highlights the need for maintaining physical distancing and prevention measures throughout the time course of vaccination in older adults.

We therefore aimed to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  in patients taking methotrexate and commonly used targeted biological therapies  compared with healthy controls. Given the roll-out of extended interval vaccination programmes to maximise population coverage  we present findings after the first dose. METHODS: In this cohort study  we recruited consecutive patients with a dermatologist-confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis who were receiving methotrexate or targeted biological monotherapy  tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors  interleukin [IL]-17 inhibitors  or IL-23 inhibitors  from a specialist psoriasis centre serving London and South East England. Consecutive volunteers without psoriasis and not receiving systemic immunosuppression who presented for vaccination at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust  London  UK  were included as the healthy control cohort. All participants had to be eligible to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before and on day 28  ±2 days  after vaccination. The primary outcomes were humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  defined as neutralising antibody responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2  and spike-specific T-cell responses  including interferon-γ  IL-2  and IL-21  28 days after vaccination. FINDINGS: Between Jan 14 and April 4  2021  84 patients with psoriasis  17 on methotrexate  27 on TNF inhibitors  15 on IL-17 inhibitors  and 25 on IL-23 inhibitors  and 17 healthy controls were included. The study population had a median age of 43 years  IQR 31–52   with 56  55%  males  45  45%  females  and 85  84%  participants of White ethnicity. Seroconversion rates were lower in patients receiving immunosuppressants  60 [78%; 95% CI 67–87] of 77  than in controls  17 [100%; 80–100] of 17   with the lowest rate in those receiving methotrexate  seven [47%; 21–73] of 15 . Neutralising activity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate  median 50% inhibitory dilution 129 [IQR 40–236]  than in controls  317 [213–487]  p=0·0032   but was preserved in those receiving targeted biologics  269 [141–418] . Neutralising titres against the B.1.1.7 variant were similarly low in all participants. Cellular immune responses were induced in all groups  and were not attenuated in patients receiving methotrexate or targeted biologics compared with controls. INTERPRETATION: Functional humoral immunity to a single dose of BNT162b2 is impaired by methotrexate but not by targeted biologics  whereas cellular responses are preserved. Seroconversion alone might not adequately reflect vaccine immunogenicity in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving therapeutic immunosuppression. Real-world pharmacovigilance studies will determine how these findings reflect clinical effectiveness. FUNDING: UK National Institute for Health Research.

We studied longitudinal cohorts of naive individuals and disease-recovered patients for up to 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. We assessed the quality of the memory response by analysis of VDJ repertoires  affinity and neutralization against variants of concern  VOCs   using unbiased cultures of 2452 MBCs. Upon boosting  the MBC pool of recovered patients selectively expanded  further matured and harbored potent neutralizers against VOCs. Although naïve individuals had weaker neutralizing serum responses  half of their RBD-specific MBCs displayed high affinity towards multiple VOCs  including delta  B.1.617.2   and one-third retained neutralizing potency against beta  B.1.351 . Our data suggest that an additional challenge in naive vaccinees could recall such affinity-matured MBCs and allow them to respond efficiently to VOCs.

We compared the impact of the Delta variant and non-Delta variant on the COVID-19 outcomes in patients from Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces  Indonesia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study  we ascertained 161 patients  69 with the Delta variant and 92 with the non-Delta variant. The Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer was used to perform the whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The mean age of patients with the Delta variant and the non-Delta variant was 27.3 ± 20.0 and 43.0 ± 20.9  p = 3 × 10 −6  . The patients with Delta variant consisted of 23 males and 46 females  while the patients with the non-Delta variant involved 56 males and 36 females  p = 0.001 . The Ct value of the Delta variant  18.4 ± 2.9  was significantly lower than that of the non-Delta variant  19.5 ± 3.8   p = 0.043 . There was no significant difference in the hospitalization and mortality of patients with Delta and non-Delta variants  p = 0.80 and 0.29  respectively . None of the prognostic factors were associated with the hospitalization  except diabetes with an OR of 3.6  95% CI = 1.02–12.5; p = 0.036 . Moreover  the patients with the following factors have been associated with higher mortality rate than the patients without the factors: age ≥65 years  obesity  diabetes  hypertension  and cardiovascular disease with the OR of 11  95% CI = 3.4–36; p = 8 × 10 −5    27  95% CI = 6.1–118; p = 1 × 10 −5    15.6  95% CI = 5.3–46; p = 6 × 10 −7    12  95% CI = 4–35.3; p = 1.2 × 10 −5    and 6.8  95% CI = 2.1–22.1; p = 0.003   respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age ≥65 years  obesity  diabetes  and hypertension were the strong prognostic factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients with the OR of 3.6  95% CI = 0.58–21.9; p = 0.028   16.6  95% CI = 2.5–107.1; p = 0.003   5.5  95% CI = 1.3–23.7; p = 0.021   and 5.8  95% CI = 1.02–32.8; p = 0.047   respectively. Conclusions: We show that the patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant have a lower Ct value than the patients infected by the non-Delta variant  implying that the Delta variant has a higher viral load  which might cause a more transmissible virus among humans. However  the Delta variant does not affect the COVID-19 outcomes in our patients. Our study also confirms that older age and comorbidity increase the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19.

Since then  the highly infectious Delta strain has been spreading globally. The Delta variant and its sub-lineages showed an increased infection rate with a reduced effect of the potential antibody neutralization. The current work is a modeled computational analysis of the mutated receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage binding with ACE2 and GRP78 to understand the increased strain transmissibility. The cell-surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78  GRP78  attached to the mutated ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD complex is modeled. The results showed that GRP78 β-substrate-binding domain weakly binds to the wild-type RBD combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-ACE2 complex. Both GRP78 and ACE2 bind approximately in the same region on the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD surface. On the other hand  GRP78 strongly binds to the mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD in the RBD-ACE2 complex through the α-substrate-binding domain instead of β-substrate-binding domain in a different region from that of ACE2. The current findings suggest that blocking the main ACE2 pathway may not prevent the interactions between GRP78 and the mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD  which might introduce an additional avenue into the virus invasion for the host cell if the ACE2 pathway is blocked by the neutralized antibodies. Hence  the peptide satpdb10668 has been proposed as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment and virus invasion into the host cell.

However  apprehension exists that variants of concern  VOCs  may evade vaccine protection  due to evidence of reduced neutralization of the VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 by vaccine sera in laboratory assays. We performed a matched cohort study to examine the distribution of VOCs in infections of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinees from Clalit Health Services  Israel  using viral genomic sequencing  and hypothesized that if vaccine effectiveness against a VOC is reduced  its proportion among breakthrough cases would be higher than in unvaccinated controls. Analyzing 813 viral genome sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs  we showed that vaccinees who tested positive at least 7 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351  compared with controls. Those who tested positive between 2 weeks after the first dose and 6 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7. These findings suggest reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs within particular time windows. Our results emphasize the importance of rigorously tracking viral variants  and of increasing vaccination to prevent the spread of VOCs.

Because this variant has more than 50 mutations  including 30 mutations on the spike  it has generated a lot of concerns on the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19. Here through ELISA assays using the recombinant RBD proteins with sequences the same to that of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04  lineage B.1   the Delta variant and the Omicron variant as the coating antigens  the binding capabilities between the RBDs and the antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent sera and vaccine sera after two doses of the inactivated vaccine produced by Sinopharm WIBP are compared with each other. The results showed that the Omicron variant may evade antibodies induced by the ancestral strain and by the inactivated vaccine  with significant reduction in the binding capability of its RBD much greater than that of the Delta variant.

Hence  the current perspective explores the possible causes of rapid upsurge in COVID-associated mucormycosis cases  which was accounted for over 70% of global cases. The five most probable factors associated with the increase of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients include diabetes mellitus  steroids overdose  high iron levels  immuno-suppression  combined with other possible factors such as unhygienic conditions  prolonged hospitalization  use of ventilators and leaky humidifiers in oxygen cylinders  creates an ideal environment for contracting mucormycosis. However  these cases could be brought down by disseminating simple preventive measures and creating awareness among the medical society and general public on this rare and deadly contagion of COVID-associated mucormycosis. The identification of the early symptoms will help to restrict the spread of lethal fungal diseases. Further  a collaborative team of surgeons  ophthalmologists  physicians  otolaryngologists specialists would be required in the hospital wards to proceed with quick surgeries on severely impacted patients.

Methods We included 1000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  collected clinical data from 997  and obtained 678 whole genome sequences by massively parallel sequencing. Bivariate  multivariate  and classification and regression tree analyses were run between clinical and genomic variables. Results Age and infection with lineages B.1.1  B.1.1.388  B.1.523  and B.1.621 were related to lethality for patients 71-88 years old  OR: 6.048036; 95% CI 1.346567-32.92521  p-value: 0.01718674 . The need for hospitalization was associated with higher age and comorbidities. For patients 38-51 years old infected with lineages A  B  B.1.1.388  B.1.1.434  B.1.153  B.1.36.10  B.1.411  B.1.471  B.1.558 or B.1.621  hospitalization rate increased significantly  OR 8.368427  95% CI 2.573145-39.10672  p-value: 0.00012 . Associations between clades and clinical outcomes diverged from previously reported data. Conclusions Lineage B.1.621 increased the need for hospitalization and lethality. Our findings  plus the rapidly increasing prevalence in Colombia and other countries  suggest broadly considering it as a Variant of Interest. If associated disease severity is confirmed  possible designation as Variant of Concern could be entertained.

Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom  South Africa and Brazil  B.1.1.28-E484K  have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless  the spread of B.1.1.28  E484K  and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work  we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul  the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28  E484K  lineage  demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28  E484K  with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also  clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state  named VUI-NP13L  characterized by 12 lineage-defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion  co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13 L in Rio Grande do Sul  we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Furthermore  combining WBE together with high-throughput sequencing techniques can be useful for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral diversity present in a given sample. The present study focuses on the genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 76 sewage samples collected during the three epidemiological waves that occurred in Spain from 14 wastewater treatment plants distributed throughout the country. The results obtained demonstrate that the metagenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater allows the detection of mutations that define the B.1.1.7 lineage and the ability of the technique to anticipate the detection of certain mutations before they are detected in clinical samples. The study proves the usefulness of sewage sequencing to track Variants of Concern that can complement clinical testing to help in decision-making and in the analysis of the evolution of the pandemic.

Sicily is one of the main entry gates of migrants crossing into Europe. We conducted a pilot study  based on the full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from migrants coming to Sicily by crossing the Mediterranean Sea  with the aim to investigate the viral genome polymorphism and to describe their genetic variations and the phylogenetic relationships. On June 21  a nongovernmental organization vessel rescued 210 migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Sicily. Of them  13.4% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen whole genome sequences were obtained to explore viral genetic variability. All but one of the sequences clustered with other viral African strains within the lineage A  whereas only one intermixed among B.1 lineage genomes. Our findings documented that most of the investigated migrants acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection before landing in Sicily. However  SARS-CoV-2 transmission during travel or in overcrowded Libyan immigrant camps and or illegal transport boats could not be ruled out. SARS-CoV-2 molecular surveillance on migrants arriving in Europe through the Sicilian gate may improve the knowledge of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamic also in light of the emergence of new variants.

Although the causal relationship among mutations and the features of SARS-CoV-2 such as rapid transmission  pathogenicity  and tropism  remains unclear  our results of genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may help to interpret the interaction between genomic characterization in SARS-CoV-2 and infectivity with the host. METHODS: A total of 4 254 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data  GISAID . Multiple sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic approach for mutation analysis were conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis  MEGA   and an in-house program based on Perl language  respectively. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains indicated that there were 3 major clades including S  V  and G  and 2 subclades  G.1 and G.2 . There were 767 types of synonymous and 1 352 types of non-synonymous mutation. ORF1a  ORF1b  S  and N genes were detected at high frequency  whereas ORF7b and E genes exhibited low frequency. In the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the S gene  11 non-synonymous mutations were observed in the region adjacent to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  binding site. CONCLUSION: It has been reported that the rapid infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with host receptor affinity are derived from several mutations in its genes. Without these genetic mutations to enhance evolutionary adaptation  species recognition  host receptor affinity  and pathogenicity  it would not survive. It is expected that our results could provide an important clue in understanding the genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2  Delta  variant has caused outbreaks among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in congregate settings and large public gatherings  3 4 . During July 2021  a COVID-19 outbreak involving the Delta variant was identified in a federal prison in Texas  infecting 172 of 233  74%  incarcerated persons in two housing units. The Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  partnered with CDC to investigate. CDC analyzed data on infection status  symptom onset date  hospitalizations  and deaths among incarcerated persons. The attack rate was higher among unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated persons  39 of 42  93% versus 129 of 185  70%; p = 0.002 .† Four persons were hospitalized  three of whom were unvaccinated  and one person died  who was unvaccinated. Among a subset of 70 persons consenting to an embedded serial swabbing protocol  the median interval between symptom onset and last positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  test result in fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons was similar  9 versus 11 days  p = 0.37 . One or more specimens were culture-positive from five of 12  42%  unvaccinated and 14 of 37  38%  fully vaccinated persons for whom viral culture was attempted. In settings where physical distancing is challenging  including correctional and detention facilities  vaccination and implementation of multicomponent prevention strategies  e.g.  testing  medical isolation  quarantine  and masking  are critical to limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission  5 .

However  the innate immune mechanisms that mediate protection during COVID-19 are not well defined. Here  we characterize a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and find that early CCR2 signaling restricts the viral burden in the lung. We find that a recently developed mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2  MA-SARS-CoV-2  strain as well as the emerging B.1.351 variant trigger an inflammatory response in the lung characterized by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes. Using intravital antibody labeling  we demonstrate that MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increases in circulating monocytes and an influx of CD45 +  cells into the lung parenchyma that is dominated by monocyte-derived cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing  scRNA-Seq  analysis of lung homogenates identified a hyperinflammatory monocyte profile. We utilize this model to demonstrate that mechanistically  CCR2 signaling promotes the infiltration of classical monocytes into the lung and the expansion of monocyte-derived cells. Parenchymal monocyte-derived cells appear to play a protective role against MA-SARS-CoV-2  as mice lacking CCR2 showed higher viral loads in the lungs  increased lung viral dissemination  and elevated inflammatory cytokine responses. These studies have identified a potential CCR2-monocyte axis that is critical for promoting viral control and restricting inflammation within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

New sensitive  rapid diagnostic tests for the wide-spectrum detection of viral variants are needed. We generated a panel of 41 monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein  NP  by using mice hybridoma techniques. Of these mAbs  nine exhibited high binding activities and were applied in latex-based lateral flow immunoassays  LFIAs . The LFIAs utilizing NP-mAb-7 and -40 had the best sensitivity and lowest limit of detection: 8 pg for purified NP and 625 TCID 50  mL for the authentic virus  hCoV-19 Taiwan 4 2020 . The specificity tests showed that the NP-mAb-40 7 LFIA strips did not cross-react with five human coronavirus strains or 20 other common respiratory pathogens. Importantly  we found that 10 NP mutants  including alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   gamma  P.1   and delta  B.1.617.2  variants  could be detected by NP-mAb-40 7 LFIA strips. A clinical study  n = 60  of the NP-mAb-40 7 LFIA strips demonstrated a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 90% in infected individuals with cycle threshold  Ct  values < 29.5. These anti-NP mAbs have strong potential for use in the clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection  whether the virus is wild-type or a variant of concern.

The present study presents the result of the monitoring of sanitary sewerage in the municipality of Niterói  a metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  and its use as a complementary indicator in the surveillance of COVID-19 cases  thus assisting actions of public health from local authorities. Twelve composite raw sewage samples were weekly collected from two wastewater treatment plants  WWTPs  and alternately from 17 sewer pipes  SP  from surrounding neighbourhoods and slums throughout 20 weeks  April 15th to August 25th  2020 . Two hundred twenty-three samples were concentrated using the ultracentrifugation-based method and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected and quantified by RT-qPCR using primers and probe targeting the N2 genome. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 84.3%  188 223  of samples with a positive rate ranging from 42%  5 12  in the first week of monitoring to 100% during the peak of epidemic with viral concentration ranging from 3.1 to 7.1 log 10  genome copies    100 mL throughout the studied period. Positive rates were higher in WWTPs when compared to SP  being useful tool for monitoring trends in the evolution of the COVID-19 curve  while SP data were more effective when health public interventions were needed. Whole-genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq System confirmed the lineage of three genomes as B.1.1.33  clade G  containing the nucleotide substitutions observed in strains that circulate in the Rio de Janeiro during the period of this study. In addition  geoprocessing tool was used to build heat maps based on SARS-CoV-2 data from sewage samples  which were weekly updated and available online to the general population as an indicator of the ongoing epidemic situation in Niterói city  raising public awareness.

This prospective observational cohort study aims to define the potential sources of introduction and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of the first nursing home facility in Singapore. An epidemiological serial point-prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted among 108 residents and 56 healthcare staff  HCS . In the current study  14  13%  residents and two  3.6%  HCS were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   with a case fatality rate  CFR  of 28.6%  4 14  among the residents. The median age of the infected residents was 86.5 [interquartile range  IQR  78.5–88] and 85.7% were women. Five residents were symptomatic  35.7%  and the others were asymptomatic  64.3% . A higher proportion of residents who succumbed to COVID-19 had hypertension than those who recovered. The SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing showed lineage B.6 which is rare globally but common regionally during the early phase of the pandemic. Household transmission is a potential source of introduction into the nursing home  with at least six epidemiologically linked secondary cases. Male residents were less implicated due to the staff segregation plan by block. Among residents  a higher proportion of the non-survivors were asymptomatic and had hypertension compared with survivors.

However  the emergence of viral variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially escape neutralizing antibody responses  warranting continued immune-monitoring. METHODS: We used a panel of 30 post-mRNA vaccination sera to determine neutralization and RBD and spike binding activity against a number of emerging viral variants. The virus neutralization was determined using authentic SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay format that mimics physiological conditions. FINDINGS: We tested seven currently circulating viral variants of concern interest  including the three Iota sublineages  Alpha  E484K   Beta  Delta and Lambda in neutralization assays. We found only small decreases in neutralization against Iota and Delta. The reduction was stronger against a sub-variant of Lambda  followed by Beta and Alpha  E484K . Lambda is currently circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany  the US and Israel. Of note  reduction in a receptor binding domain and spike binding assay that also included Gamma  Kappa and A.23.1 was negligible. INTERPRETATION: Taken together  these findings suggest that mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may remain effective against these viral variants of concern interest and that spike binding antibody tests likely retain specificity in the face of evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

At the end of 2020  a variant named 20I 501Y.V1  lineage B.1.1.7  emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated with biological evidence that this variant and the original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here  we analyze the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain  lineage B1 . Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However  when both viruses were put in competition in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium  the 20I 501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. All together  these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and may contribute to a better understanding of the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the severe acute respiratory CoV-2  SARS-CoV-2  20I 501Y.V1 variant.

Among them  the most scarce information has been obtained from the P.1 variant and more data on its global presence and about its spreading dynamics are needed. Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed prospectively on travellers arriving from Brasil and on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from our population. Results: In this study we report the first SARS-CoV-2 P.1 and P.2 variants exported from Brazil to Spain. The case infected with the P.1 variant  who had only stayed in Rio de Janeiro  required hospitalization. The two P.2 cases remained asymptomatic. A wider distribution for P.1 variant beyond the Brazilian Amazonia should be considered. The exportation of the P.2 variant  carrying the E484K mutation  deserves attention. Conclusion: One month after the first description of P.1 and P.2 importations from Brazil to Madrid  these variants were identified circulating in the community  in cases without a travel history  and involved in household transmissions.

Here  we showed that the South African variant B.1.351 was the most resistant to current monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma from COVID-19-infected individuals  followed by the Brazilian variant P.1 and the UK variant B.1.1.7. This resistance hierarchy corresponded with Y144del and 242-244del mutations in the N-terminal domain and K417N T  E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2. Crystal structural analysis of B.1.351 triple mutant  417N-484K-501Y  RBD complexed with monoclonal antibody P2C-1F11 revealed the molecular basis for antibody neutralization and escape. B.1.351 and P.1 also acquired the ability to use mouse and mink ACE2 receptor for entry. Our results demonstrate major antigenic shifts and potential broadening of the host range for B.1.351 and P.1 variants  which pose serious challenges to our current antibody therapies and vaccine protection.

Though vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  have been developed to fight COVID-19 in the past year  one major concern is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs . Indeed  SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as B.1.1.7  UK   B.1.351  South Africa   P.1  Brazil   and B.1.617.1  India  now dominate the pandemic. Herein  we found that binding activity and neutralizing capacity of sera collected from convalescent patients in early 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs  but not non-VOC variants  were severely blunted. Furthermore  we observed evasion of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from a VH3-30 mAb 32D4  which was proved to exhibit highly potential neutralization against wild-type  WT  SARS-CoV-2. Thus  these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be able to spread in convalescent patients and even harbor resistance to medical countermeasures. New interventions against these SARS-CoV-2 VOCs are urgently needed.

Prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already shown striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless  concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here  we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38-142 in complex with the receptor binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recognition of the N343 glycosylation site and water-mediated interactions facilitate cross-reactivity of CV38-142 to SARS-related viruses  allowing the antibody to accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies  notably COVA1-16  to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2  including circulating variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Overall  this study provides valuable information for vaccine and therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 and protect against zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.

However  a deadly second wave of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   infected by SARS-CoV-2 variants  especially the Delta  B.1.617.2  variant  with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections were reported in the world recently. Actually  Delta variant not only resulted in a severe surge of vaccine breakthrough infections which was accompanied with high viral load and transmissibility  but also challenged the development of effective vaccines. Therefore  the biological characteristics and epidemiological profile of Delta variant  the current status of Delta variant vaccine breakthrough infections and the mechanism of vaccine breakthrough infections were discussed in this article. In addition  the significant role of the Delta variant spike  S  protein in the mechanism of immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 was highlighted in this article. In particular  we further discussed key points on the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research and development  hoping to make a contribution to the early  accurate and rapid control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

However  with the exception of farmed mink  there is no previous evidence that these infected animals can infect humans  resulting in sustained human-to-human transmission. Following a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of a pet shop worker  animals in the shop and the warehouse supplying it were tested for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this case study  viral swabs and blood samples were collected from animals in a pet shop and its corresponding warehouse in Hong Kong. Nasal swab or saliva samples from human COVID-19 patients epidemiologically linked to the pet shop and from subsequent local cases confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 delta variant were collected. Oral swabs were tested by quantitative RT-PCR  RT-qPCR  for SARS-CoV-2 and blood samples were serologically tested by a surrogate virus neutralisation test and plaque reduction neutralisation test. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive samples were sequenced by next generation viral full genome sequencing using the ISeq sequencing platform  Illumina   and the viral genomes were phylogenetically analysed. FINDINGS: Eight  50%  of 16 individually tested Syrian hamsters in the pet shop and seven  58%  of 12 Syrian hamsters in the corresponding warehouse were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in RT-qPCR or serological tests. None of the dwarf hamsters  n=75   rabbits  n=246   guinea pigs  n=66   chinchillas  n=116   and mice  n=2  were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-qPCR tests. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes deduced from human and hamster cases in this incident all belong to the delta variant of concern  AY.127  that had not been circulating locally before this outbreak. The viral genomes obtained from hamsters were phylogenetically related with some sequence heterogeneity. Phylogenetic dating suggests infection in these hamsters occurred around Oct 14  2021  95% CI Sept 15 to Nov 9  2021 . Multiple zoonotic transmission events to humans were detected  leading to onward human-to-human transmission. INTERPRETATION: Pet hamsters can be naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2. The virus can circulate among hamsters and lead to human infections. Both genetic and epidemiological results strongly suggest that there was more than one hamster-to-human transmission event in this study. This incident also led to onward human transmission. Importation of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters was a likely source of this outbreak. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health  Research Grants Council of Hong Kong  Food and Health Bureau  and InnoHK.

Based on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  there is an urgent need to understand whether patients are able to mount a sufficient response to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS MM and WM patients are vaccinated with mRNA-1273  Moderna   BNT162b2 mRNA  Pfizer BioNTech   or JNJ-78436735  Johnson & Johnson  in a prospective clinical trial. Primary endpoint is SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  S  antibody  Ab  detection 28 days after final vaccination. Secondary endpoints include functional serologic assessments and T-cell responses at 28 days  6 months  9 months  and 12 months following vaccination. S Abs were detected by Elecsys assay  Roche Diagnostics   with ³ 0.80 U mL defined as positive and titers > 250 U mL considered stronger correlates of neutralization. SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and variant S-specific Ab isotypes and FcγR binding profiles were quantified by custom Luminex assay. Antibody-dependent neutrophil and cellular phagocytosis  ADNP and ADCP  were assessed using flow cytometry. RESULTS To date 141 patients have been enrolled  137  91 MM and 46 WM  of whom had an S Ab assessment. Median Ab titer was 178.0  IQR  16.10-1166.0  for MM and 3.92  IQR  0-278.9  for WM. S Ab response rate was 91%  83 91  in MM and 56%  27 46  in WM. However  responses achieving S Ab >250 U mL were 47.3%  43 91  in MM and 26.1%  12 46  in WM. In patients ³75 years  responses >250 u mL were 13.3%  2 15; p<0.05 . Vaccine-specific S Ab responses >250 u mL following mRNA-1273  BNT162b2  and JNJ-78436735 were 67.6%  23 34; p<0.05   38.3%  18 47; p=NS   and 20%  2 10; p=NS  in MM and 50.0%  8 16; p<0.05   14.8%  4 27; p<0.05   and 0%  0 3; p=NS  in WM. Among MM patients with progressive disease  S Ab response >250 u mL occurred in 30%  6 20  as opposed to 55.6%  30 54  for VGPR+  p<0.05 . MM patients having autologous stem cell transplant within 12 months demonstrated 100%  5 5; p<0.05  S Ab responses. For MM patients actively receiving an anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab or an immunomodulatory drug  S Ab response occurred in 38.9%  14 36; p=NS  and 50.9%  28 55; p<0.05 . Among WM patients  S Ab responses >250 U mL occurred in 63.6%  7 11; p<0.05  previously untreated; 0%  0 9; p<0.05  who received rituximab within 12 months; 10%  2 20 ; p<0.05  on an active Bruton Tyrosine Kinase  BTK  inhibitor; and 20%  3 15; p=NS  who received other therapies. Functional Ab studies were performed on 14 MM patients  14 WM  patients  and 14 healthy donors  HD   Figure 1 . All patients were assessed 28 days following their final vaccination and myeloma patients had an additional assessment 28 days following initial vaccination. MM and WM patients demonstrated less IGG1 and IGG3 S Ab production than HD. MM patients showed increased IgA and IgM S Ab production as well as increased FcgR2A binding following a second vaccine in contrast to HD. Both ADNP and ADCP were reduced in MM and WM patients. MM patients demonstrated improved ADCP in SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351  B.1.117  and P.1 versus wildtype  p<0.05 . CONCLUSIONS We report the first known evidence of impaired functional humoral responses following COVID-19 vaccines in patients with MM and WM. Overall  WM patients showed more severe impairment of COVID-19 S Ab responses. Most previously untreated WM patients achieved S Ab responses  however the most significant reduction in S Ab responses were seen in WM patients who received rituximab within 12 months or active BTK inhibitors. For MM patients  being in disease remission associated with improved S Ab response. Among MM and WM patients  age ³75 years associated with significantly lower rates and vaccination with MRNA-1273  Moderna  elicited significantly higher S Ab response rates than other vaccines. A defect in ADNP and more profound defect in ADCP suggests overall compromised opsinophagocytic activity among MM and WM patients. Data comparing first and second vaccine responses in MM patients  suggest less efficient class switching to IGG as well as incomplete maturation of their FcgR2A binding profiles but normal maturation of FcgR3A. Interestingly  ADCP was improved in several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. T-cell studies are pending and will be updated. Further understanding of the immunological response to COVID19 vaccination is needed to clarify patients risks  and necessity for booster or alternative protective measures against COVID-19.

We investigated the association between time since two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in Scotland  where delta was dominant   with comparative analyses in Brazil  where delta was uncommon . METHODS: In this retrospective  population-based cohort study in Brazil and Scotland  we linked national databases from the EAVE II study in Scotland; and the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign  Acute Respiratory Infection Suspected Cases  and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Illness datasets in Brazil  for vaccination  laboratory testing  clinical  and mortality data. We defined cohorts of adults  aged ≥18 years  who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and compared rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes  ie  COVID-19 hospital admission or death  across fortnightly periods  relative to 2–3 weeks after the second dose. Entry to the Scotland cohort started from May 19  2021  and entry to the Brazil cohort started from Jan 18  2021. Follow-up in both cohorts was until Oct 25  2021. Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratios  RRs  and vaccine effectiveness  with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 1 972 454 adults received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Scotland and 42 558 839 in Brazil  with longer follow-up in Scotland because two-dose vaccination began earlier in Scotland than in Brazil. In Scotland  RRs for severe COVID-19 increased to 2·01  95% CI 1·54–2·62  at 10–11 weeks  3·01  2·26–3·99  at 14–15 weeks  and 5·43  4·00–7·38  at 18–19 weeks after the second dose. The pattern of results was similar in Brazil  with RRs of 2·29  2·01–2·61  at 10–11 weeks  3·10  2·63–3·64  at 14–15 weeks  and 4·71  3·83–5·78  at 18–19 weeks after the second dose. In Scotland  vaccine effectiveness decreased from 83·7%  95% CI 79·7–87·0  at 2–3 weeks  to 75·9%  72·9–78·6  at 14–15 weeks  and 63·7%  59·6–67·4  at 18–19 weeks after the second dose. In Brazil  vaccine effectiveness decreased from 86·4%  85·4–87·3  at 2–3 weeks  to 59·7%  54·6–64·2  at 14–15 weeks  and 42·2%  32·4–50·6  at 18–19 weeks. INTERPRETATION: We found waning vaccine protection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths in both Scotland and Brazil  this becoming evident within three months of the second vaccine dose. Consideration needs to be given to providing booster vaccine doses for people who have received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2  with its predecessors  i.e.  MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV  belong to the family of Coronaviridae. Reportedly  COVID-19 has infected 344 710 576 people around the globe and killed nearly 5 598 511 persons in the short span of two years. On November 24  2021  B.1.1.529 strain  later named Omicron  was classified as a Variant of Concern  VOC . SARS-CoV-2 has continuously undergone a series of unprecedented mutations and evolved to exhibit varying characteristics. These mutations have largely occurred in the spike  S  protein  site for antibody binding   which attribute high infectivity and transmissibility characteristics to the Omicron strain. Although many studies have attempted to understand this new challenge in the COVID-19 strains race  there is still a lot to be demystified. Therefore  the purpose of this review was to summarize the structural or virologic characteristics  burden  and epidemiology of the Omicron variant and its potential to evade the immune response.

Methods : We conducted a cross-sectional study among crew members using epidemiological data and results from SARS-CoV-2-PCR of nasopharynx-oropharynx samples  antibody analyses of blood-samples  and whole-genome sequencing. Results : We included 114 multinational crew members  71% participation   median age 36 years and 69% men. Attack rate was 33%; 32 of 37 outbreak-cases were seropositive 5-10 days post-PCR. One PCR-negative participant was seropositive  suggesting prior infection. Network-analysis showed clusters based on common exposures  including embarkation date  nationality  sharing cabin with an infected cabin-mate  AOR 3.27  95%CI 0.97-11.07  p=0.057   and specific workplaces  mechanical operations: 9.17  1.82-45.78   catering: 6.11  1.83-20.38  . Breaches in testing  quarantine and isolation practices before during expeditions were reported. Whole-genome sequencing revealed lineage B.1.36  previously identified in Asia. Despite extensive sequencing  continued transmission of B.1.36 in Norway was not detected. Conclusions : Our findings confirm high risk of SARS-CoV-2-transmission on cruise ships related to workplace and cabin-type and show that continued community-transmission after the outbreak could be stopped by implementing immediate infection control measures at the final destination.

These variants pose significant health threats and possibly undermine ongoing vaccination efforts. Recent research showed that flight bans on the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in January 2020 were implemented too late and therefore  turned out to be largely ineffective  enabling a swift turn into a fully-blown pandemic. In this study  we investigate the following question: How effective were existing flight bans against the newly emerged variants of concern? In other words: Do airlines and countries happen to repeat the same mistake again? We analyze the spread of the three most prevalent variants of concern right now: B.1.1.7  known as the UK variant   B.1.351  known as the South African variant   and P.1  known as the Brazilian variant . We find that many countries  again  implemented flights bans once the mutated virus had enough time to be imported via air transportation. To support our empirical analysis further  we designed and implemented a compartmental network spreading model on top of worldwide flight data for the years 2020 and 2021. We observe that the model predictions are rather accurate and confirm our findings. Overall  we hope that our study encourages air transportation stakeholders and policy makers to avoid repeating earlier mistakes in the future  with the ultimate goal to overcome COVID-19 entirely.

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants  we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417  E484 and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain  RBD . Despite this  we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern  including B.1.1.7  alpha   P.1  gamma  and B.1.617.2  delta . Notably  antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants  suggesting different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to wildtype  WT  SARS-CoV-2 do possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.

Lending support to this critically important result of the aforementioned trial  we demonstrated in our study that patients infected with a SARS-Cov-2 sub-lineage  B.1.1.284  carrying the Pro108Ser mutation in 3CL pro  tended to have a comparatively milder clinical course  i.e.  a smaller proportion of patients required oxygen supplementation during the clinical course  than patients infected with the same sub-lineage of virus not carrying the mutation. Characterization of the mutant 3CL pro  revealed that the Kcat Km of the 3CL pro  enzyme containing Ser108 was 58% lower than that of Pro108 3CL pro . Hydrogen deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry  HDX-MS  revealed that the reduced activity was associated with structural perturbation surrounding the substrate-binding region of the enzyme  which is positioned behind and distant from the 108th amino acid residue. Our findings of the attenuated clinical course of COVID-19 in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 strains with reduced 3CL pro  enzymatic activity greatly endorses the promising result of the aforementioned clinical trial of the 3CL pro  inhibitor.

Here  we compare SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cells against the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and CAL.20C lineages in COVID-19 convalescents and in recipients of the Moderna  mRNA-1273  or Pfizer BioNTech  BNT162b2  COVID-19 vaccines. The total reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is similar in terms of magnitude and frequency of response  with decreases in the 10%–22% range observed in some assay VOC combinations. A total of 7% and 3% of previously identified CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cell epitopes  respectively  are affected by mutations in the various VOCs. Thus  the SARS-CoV-2 variants analyzed here do not significantly disrupt the total SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity; however  the decreases observed highlight the importance for active monitoring of T cell reactivity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

To uncover their humoral response in detail  we performed single B-cell analysis from 10 SARS-CoV-2 elite neutralizers. We isolated and analyzed 126 monoclonal antibodies  many of which were sarbecovirus cross-reactive  with some displaying merbecovirus- and embecovirus-reactivity. Several isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies were effective against B.1.1.7  B1.351  B.1.429  B.1.617  B.1.617.2 variants and 19 prominent potential escape sites. Furthermore  assembly of 716 806 SARS-CoV-2 sequences predicted emerging escape variants  which were also effectively neutralized. One of these broadly neutralizing potent antibodies  R40-1G8  is a IGHV3-53 RBD-Class-1 antibody. Remarkably  Cryo-EM analysis revealed that R40-1G8 has a flexible binding mode  targeting both ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations of the RBD. Given the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants  we demonstrate that elite neutralizers are a valuable source for isolating ultrapotent antibody candidates to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The recently described variant of concern designated Omicron  B.1.1.529  has rapidly spread worldwide and is now responsible for the majority of COVID-19 cases in many countries. Because Omicron was recognized very recently  many knowledge gaps exist about its epidemiology  clinical severity  and disease course. A genome sequencing study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Houston Methodist healthcare system identified 4 468 symptomatic patients with infections caused by Omicron from late November 2021 through January 5  2022. Omicron very rapidly increased in only three weeks to cause 90% of all new COVID-19 cases  and at the end of the study period caused 98% of new cases. Compared to patients infected with either Alpha or Delta variants in our healthcare system  Omicron patients were significantly younger  had significantly increased vaccine breakthrough rates  and were significantly less likely to be hospitalized. Omicron patients required less intense respiratory support and had a shorter length of hospital stay  consistent with on average decreased disease severity. Two patients with Omicron “stealth” sublineage BA.2 also were identified. The data document the unusually rapid spread and increased occurrence of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant in metropolitan Houston  and address the lack of information about disease character among US patients.

Among the enrolled pets  we identified a SARS-CoV-2-infected cat and dog from the same household; both animals were asymptomatic but had close contact with the symptomatic and SARS-CoV-2-positive owner. Whole genome sequencing of animal and owner specimens revealed identical viral genomes of the B.1.575 lineage  suggesting zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human to at least one pet. This is the first report of the B.1.575 lineage in companion animals. Genetically linking SARS-CoV-2 between people and animals  and tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is essential to detect any cross-species SARS-CoV-2 transmission that may lead to more transmissible or severe variants that can affect humans. Surveillance studies  including genomic analyses of owner and pet specimens  are needed to further our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 impacts companion animals.

The epidemic accelerated in Philadelphia  PA  in the spring of 2020  with the city experiencing a first peak of infections on 15 April  followed by a decline through midsummer. Here  we investigate spread of the epidemic in the first wave in Philadelphia using full-genome sequencing of 52 SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from 27 hospitalized patients collected between 30 March and 17 July 2020. Sequences most commonly resembled lineages circulating at earlier times in New York  suggesting transmission primarily from this location  though a minority of Philadelphia genomes matched sequences from other sites  suggesting additional introductions. Multiple genomes showed even closer matches to other Philadelphia isolates  suggestive of ongoing transmission within Philadelphia. We found that all of our isolates contained the D614G substitution in the viral spike and belong to lineages variously designated B.1  Nextstrain clade 20A or 20C  and GISAID clade G or GH. There were no viral sequence polymorphisms detectably associated with disease outcome. For some patients  genome sequences were determined longitudinally or concurrently from multiple body sites. In both cases  some comparisons showed reproducible polymorphisms  suggesting initial seeding with multiple variants and or accumulation of polymorphisms after infection. These results thus provide data on the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Philadelphia and begin to explore the dynamics within hospitalized patients.

With apparent increased transmissibility variant B.1.617.2 has contributed to the current wave of infection ravaging the Indian subcontinent and has been designated a variant of concern in the UK. Here we study the ability of monoclonal antibodies  convalescent and vaccine sera to neutralize B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 and complement this with structural analyses of Fab RBD complexes and map the antigenic space of current variants. Neutralization of both viruses is reduced when compared with ancestral Wuhan related strains but there is no evidence of widespread antibody escape as seen with B.1.351. However  B.1.351 and P.1 sera showed markedly more reduction in neutralization of B.1.617.2 suggesting that individuals previously infected by these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B.1.617.2. This observation provides important new insight for immunisation policy with future variant vaccines in non-immune populations.

A novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage  B.1.177  reportedly arose in Spain in the summer of 2020  with subsequent spread across Europe linked to travel by infected individuals. Surveillance and monitoring through the use of whole genome sequencing  WGS  offers insights into the global and local movement of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and can detect introductions of novel variants. Methods We analysed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced for surveillance purposes from specimens received by Public Health Ontario  Sept 6 – Oct 10  2020   collected from individuals in eastern Ontario  which comprised the study sample. Taxonomic lineages were identified using pangolin  v2.08  and phylogenetic analysis incorporated publicly available genomes covering the same time period as the study sample. Epidemiological data collected from laboratory requisitions and standard reportable disease case investigation was integrated into the analysis. Results Genomic surveillance identified a COVID-19 case with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.177 from an individual in eastern Ontario in late September  2020. The individual had recently returned from Europe. Genomic analysis with publicly available data indicate the most closely related genomes to this specimen were from Southern Europe. Genomic surveillance did not identify further cases with this lineage. Conclusions Genomic surveillance allowed for early detection of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Ontario which was deemed to be travel related. This type of genomic-based surveillance is a key tool to measure the effectiveness of public health measures such as mandatory self-isolation for returned travellers  aimed at preventing onward transmission of newly introduced lineages of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to undergo frequent mutations  including SNPs and deletions  which seem to be transmitted together  forming clusters that define specific lineages. Reverse-Transcription quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  has been used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and is still considered the gold standard method. Our Eukaryotic Host Pathogens Interaction  EHPI  laboratory received six SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from a Sicilian private analysis laboratory  four of which showed a dropout of the E gene. Our sequencing data revealed the presence of a synonymous mutation  c.26415 C > T  TAC > TAT  in the E gene of all four samples showing the dropout in RT-qPCR. Interestingly  these samples also harbored three other mutations  S137L—Orf1ab; N439K—S gene; A156S—N gene   which had a very low diffusion rate worldwide. This combination suggested that these mutations may be linked to each other and more common in a specific area than in the rest of the world. Thus  we decided to analyze the 103 sequences in our internal database in order to confirm or disprove our “mutation cluster hypothesis”. Within our database  one sample showed the synonymous mutation  c.26415 C > T  TAC > TAT  in the E gene. This work underlines the importance of territorial epidemiological surveillance by means of NGS and the sequencing of samples with clinical and or technical particularities  e.g.  post-vaccine infections or RT-qPCR amplification failures  to allow for the early identification of these SNPs. This approach may be an effective method to detect new mutational clusters and thus to predict new emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages before they spread globally.

Therapeutic implementation of these antibodies has been challenged by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutated spike versions. Consequently  re-assessment of previously identified mAbs is of high priority. Four previously selected mAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes are now evaluated for binding potency to mutated RBD versions  reported to mediate escape from antibody neutralization. In vitro neutralization potencies of these mAbs  and two NTD-specific mAbs  are evaluated against two frequent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  the B.1.1.7 Alpha  and the B.1.351 Beta. Furthermore  we demonstrate therapeutic potential of three selected mAbs by treatment of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice two days post infection with each virus variant. Thus  despite the accumulation of spike mutations  the highly potent MD65 and BL6 mAbs retain their ability to bind the prevalent viral mutants  effectively protecting against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.

Its subsequent evolution has led to emergence of multiple sublineages  many of which are well-mixed between countries. AIM: Here  we aim to study the emergence and spread of the Delta lineage in Russia. METHODS: We use a phylogeographic approach to infer imports of Delta sublineages into Russia  and phylodynamic models to assess the rate of their spread. RESULTS: We show that nearly the entire Delta epidemic in Russia has probably descended from a single import event despite genetic evidence of multiple Delta imports. Indeed  over 90% of Delta samples in Russia are characterized by the nsp2:K81N+ORF7a:P45L pair of mutations which is rare outside Russia  putting them in the AY.122 sublineage. The AY.122 lineage was frequent in Russia among Delta samples from the start  and has not increased in frequency in other countries where it has been observed  suggesting that its high prevalence in Russia has probably resulted from a random founder effect. CONCLUSION: The apartness of the genetic composition of the Delta epidemic in Russia makes Russia somewhat unusual  although not exceptional  among other countries.

Although we do not have any knowledge upon the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe adopted by this kit  it is likely that N gene dropout only occurs when 28948C > T is coupled with 28932C > T  this latter present  in turn  in all B.1.177.75 sequences available on public databases. Furthermore  epidemiological analysis was also performed. The majority of the N-negative B.1.177.75 cases belonged to two clusters apparently unrelated to each other and both clusters involved young people. However  the phylogeny for sequences containing the + + - pattern strongly supports a genetic connection and one common source for both clusters. Though  genetic comparison suggests a connection rather than indicating the independent emergence of the same mutation in two apparently unrelated clusters. This study highlights once more the importance of sharing genomic data to link apparently unrelated epidemiological clusters and to  remarkably  update molecular tests.

Spike is also undergoing immunogenic selection with variants that increase infectivity and partially escape convalescent plasma. Here  we describe Spike Display  a high-throughput platform to rapidly characterize glycosylated spike ectodomains across multiple coronavirus-family proteins. We assayed ∼200 variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes for their expression  ACE2 binding  and recognition by 13 nAbs. An alanine scan of all five N-terminal domain  NTD  loops highlights a public epitope in the N1  N3  and N5 loops recognized by most NTD-binding nAbs.

White-tailed deer  the predominant cervid in North America  are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection  and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in deer  283 retropharyngeal lymph node  RPLN  samples collected from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January of 2021 were assayed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283  33.2%  deer samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR. Notably  following the November 2020 peak of human cases in Iowa  and coinciding with the onset of winter and the peak deer hunting season  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 80 of 97  82.5%  RPLN samples collected over a 7-wk period. Whole genome sequencing of all 94 positive RPLN samples identified 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages  with B.1.2  n = 51; 54.5%  and B.1.311  n = 19; 20%  accounting for ∼75% of all samples. The geographic distribution and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer spread. These discoveries have important implications for the long-term persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our findings highlight an urgent need for a robust and proactive “One Health” approach to obtain enhanced understanding of the ecology  molecular evolution  and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.

The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals  which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type  WT  and the South African B.1.351  SA  variant towards MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT SA∙∙∙MAO complex formation  which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates  thereby impacting their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies  these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection  thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances  and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future  we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored  but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.

In the current study  an in-depth investigation for the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation route using graphene oxide  GO  is presented. We focus on the antiviral effect of GO nanosheets on three SARS-CoV-2 strains: Wuhan  B.1.1.7  U.K. variant   and P.1  Brazilian variant . Plaque assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  showed that 50 and 98% of the virus in a supernatant could be cleared following incubation with GO  100 μg mL  for 1 and 60 min  respectively. Transmission electron microscopy  TEM  analysis and protein  spike  S  and nucleocapsid  N  proteins  decomposition evaluation confirm a two-step virus inactivation mechanism that includes  i  adsorption of the positively charged spike of SARS-CoV-2 on the negatively charged GO surface and  ii  neutralization inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 on the surface of GO through decomposition of the viral protein. As the interaction of S protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter into human cells  the damage to the S protein using GO makes it a potential candidate for use in contributing to the inhibition of the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically  our findings provide the potential for the construction of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 face mask using a GO nanosheet  which could contribute greatly to preventing the spread of the virus. In addition  as the effect of surface contamination can be severe in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2  the development of efficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 protective surfaces coatings based on GO nanosheets could play a significant role in controlling the spread of the virus through the utilization of GO-based nonwoven cloths  filters  and so on.

Vaccinated individuals as a potential source of transmission,Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has shown to offer effective protection against Coronavirus disease  COVID-19  in persons 16 years of age or older in different trials [1 2]  but its role against SARS-CoV-2 infection  determining subsequent positivity to real-time polymerase chain reaction  PCR  swab test is still unknown. Indeed  though being one of the greatest achievements reached by the scientific community in the last century  these trials did not address whether vaccinations succeeded to prevent asymptomatic infections. Only recently  plaque reduction neutralization testing was used to demonstrate that the BNT162b2 vaccine was capable to neutralize new highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the S gene  detected in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7 lineage   South Africa  B.1.351 lineage   and Brazil  P.1 lineage  [3]. Nevertheless  knowing if vaccination may as well prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading is of the outmost importance especially among healthcare workers  HCWs   who are known to be at high risk of transmitting the viral disease in the hospital setting [4]. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections have been poorly described [5]  but cases of swab test positivity after the vaccination have been often reported by mass media nowadays  along with concerns that vaccinated individuals could still transmit SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19 vaccination [6]. Nevertheless  to date  no report that would at least sound scientific  is currently available. Hereby  we briefly report the first real-world case of positive PCR test in a HCW after full dose vaccination-induced immunity.

Data on breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections in vaccinated individuals and transmission risk are limited. The aim of this study was to provide estimates of transmission risk in Delta variant breakthrough infections. Study design : Methods To analyse onward transmission of fully vaccinated individuals infected with B.1.617.2  we compared 85 patients  vaccination group [VG]  with an age- and sex-matched unvaccinated control group  CG; n = 85 . Results Transmission of B.1.617.2 was significantly reduced  halved  in the VG. The number of infected contacts to total number of contacts per infected person was 0.26 ± 0.40 in the VG vs 0.56 ± 0.45 in the CG  p = .001 . Similarly  fully vaccinated contacts were less likely to be infected by fully vaccinated infected persons  IPs  than by unvaccinated IPs  20.0% vs 37.5%   although this association was not significant. Conclusions Fully vaccinated contacts had 50% less transmissions than unvaccinated individuals. These findings must be verified in larger sample populations and it is especially important to investigate the role of vaccination status of close contacts.

The world witnessed three waves of the corona virus till now  and more upcoming is expected  whereas several challenges are presented. Empirical data displayed that the features of the virus effects do vary between the three periods. The severity of the disease  differences in symptoms  attitudes of the people have been reported  although the comparative characteristics of the three waves still keep essentially indefinite. In contrast  the sense of danger toward the cries gradually decreases in most countries. This may be due to some factors  including the approved vaccines  introducing alternative plans from politicians to control and deal with the epidemic  and decreasing the mortality rates. However  the alarm voice started to rise again with the appearance of new variant strains with several mutations in the virus. Several more questions began to be asked without sufficient answers. Mutations in COVID-19 have introduced an extreme challenge in preventing and treating SARS-COV-2. The essential feature for mutations is producing new variants known by high tensmibility  disturbing the viral fitness  and enhancing the virus replication. One of the variants that have emerged recently is the Delta variant  B.1.617.2   which was firstly detected in India. In November 2021  a more ferocious mutant appeared in South Africa  also called omicron  B.1.1.529 . These mutants grabbed world attention because of their higher transmissibility than the progenitor variants and spread rapidly. Several information about the virus are still confusing and remains secret. There are eight approved vaccines in the market; however  the investigation race about their effect against reinfection and their role against the new variants is still under investigation. Furthermore  this is the first time vaccinating against COVID-19  so the question remains: Will we need an annual dose of the corona vaccines  and the side effects don't been observed till now?

At the same time  there is limited knowledge about these emerging variants. Even if research data are available  it is varyingly scattered. In this review  we have discussed the appearance of significant alarming SARS‐CoV‐2 variants in the entire world. The study also discusses the properties of the substantial variant of concern  VOC  variants such as B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P.1  Gamma   B.1.427  Epsilon  and B.1.429  Epsilon . At the same time  the characteristic properties of some significant variant of interest  VOI  variants like B.1.525  Eta   B.1.526  Iota   sublineage B.1.526.1   B.1.617  sublineages B.1.617.1  Kappa   B.1.617.2  Delta  and B.1.617.3   P.2  Zeta   P.3  Theta   B.1.616 and B.1.427 have also been discussed. Here  we have explained some essential mutations for the VOC and VOI variants such as K417T N  L452R  E484K  N501Y  D614G and P681R. Consecutively  we also highlighted the crucial clinical characteristics of the variants  such as transmissibility  infectivity  re‐infectivity  immune escape  vaccine activity and vaccine escape. Our comprehensive review will provide updated information on the newly appearing variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 and help the researchers to formulate strategies to curtail the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Small molecules that interfere with binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain  RBD  to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme II  ACE2  receptor may be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here  we screened 512 pure compounds derived from natural products using a high-throughput RBD ACE2 binding assay and identified  – -hopeaphenol  a resveratrol tetramer  in addition to vatalbinoside A and vaticanol B  as potent and selective inhibitors of RBD ACE2 binding and viral entry. For example   – -hopeaphenol disrupted RBD ACE2 binding with a 50% inhibitory concentration  IC 50   of 0.11 μM  in contrast to an IC 50  of 28.3 μM against the unrelated host ligand receptor binding pair PD-1 PD-L1  selectivity index  257.3 . When assessed against the USA-WA1 2020 variant   – -hopeaphenol also inhibited entry of a VSVΔG-GFP reporter pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike into ACE2-expressing Vero-E6 cells and in vitro replication of infectious virus in cytopathic effect and yield reduction assays  50% effective concentrations [EC 50 s]  10.2 to 23.4 μM  without cytotoxicity and approaching the activities of the control antiviral remdesivir  EC 50 s  1.0 to 7.3 μM . Notably   – -hopeaphenol also inhibited two emerging variants of concern  B.1.1.7 Alpha and B.1.351 Beta in both viral and spike-containing pseudovirus assays with similar or improved activities over the USA-WA1 2020 variant. These results identify  – -hopeaphenol and related stilbenoid analogues as potent and selective inhibitors of viral entry across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Despite the unprecedented pace of vaccine development  with six vaccines already in use worldwide  the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 ‘variants of concern’  VOC  across diverse geographic locales have prompted re-evaluation of strategies to achieve universal vaccination 3 . All three officially designated VOC carry Spike  S  polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited during initial waves of the pandemic 4–8 . Here  we characterize the biological consequences of the ensemble of S mutations present in VOC lineages B.1.1.7  501Y.V1  and B.1.351  501Y.V2 . Using a replication-competent EGFP-reporter vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  system  rcVSV-CoV2-S  which encodes S from SARS coronavirus 2 in place of VSV-G  and coupled with a clonal HEK-293T ACE2 TMPRSS2 cell line optimized for highly efficient S-mediated infection  we determined that only 1 out of 12 serum samples from a cohort of recipients of the Gamaleya Sputnik V Ad26   Ad5 vaccine showed effective neutralization  IC 90   of rcVSV-CoV2-S: B.1.351 at full serum strength. The same set of sera efficiently neutralized S from B.1.1.7 and showed only moderately reduced activity against S carrying the E484K substitution alone. Taken together  our data suggest that control of some emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may benefit from updated vaccines.

In the present study  we used the COVIDSeq protocol  which involves multiplex-PCR  barcoding  and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates  amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally  the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1 143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge  this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2  with an additional advantage of enabling the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Since then  the pandemic has evolved with the large worldwide emergence of new variants  such as the Alpha  B.1.1.7 variant   Beta  B.1.351 variant   and Gamma  P.1 variant   and some other under investigation such as the A.27 in France. Many studies are focusing on antibody neutralisation changes according to the spike mutations  but to date  little is known regarding their respective replication capacities. In this work  we demonstrate that the Alpha variant provides an earlier replication in vitro  on Vero E6 and A549 cells  than Beta  Gamma  A.27  and historical lineages. This earlier replication was associated with higher infectious titres in cell-culture supernatants  in line with the higher viral loads observed among Alpha-infected patients. Interestingly  Beta and Gamma variants presented similar kinetic and viral load than the other non-Alpha-tested variants.

Herd immunity through vaccination is our major expectation to rein the virus. However  the emergence of widespread genetic variants could potentially undermine the vaccines. The evidence that some variants could evade immune responses elicited by vaccines and previous infection is growing. In this review  we summarized the current understanding on five notable genetic variants  i.e.  D614G  Cluster 5  VOC 202012 01  501Y.V2 and P.1  and discussed the potential impact of these variants on the virus transmission  pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. We also highlight that mutations in the N-terminal domain of spike protein should be considered when evaluating the antibody neutralization abilities. Among these genetic variants  a concern of genetic variant 501Y.V2 to escape the protection by vaccines was raised. We therefore call for new vaccines targeting this variant to be developed.

Eleven other sequences in France and 8 831 worldwide were available from GISAID  92% originating from Japan. The three genome sequences from our institute were phylogenetically closest to another from Guinea-Conakry  where one of the patients had travelled. These viruses did not exhibit any unusual features in cell culture. Spike structural predictions indicated a 1.3-time higher transmissibility index than for the globally spread B.1.1.7 variant but also an affinity loss for gangliosides that might have slowed dissemination. The spread of new SARS-CoV-2 mutants variants is still not well understood and therefore difficult to predict  and this hinders implementation of effective preventive measures  including adapted vaccines.

To prevent further spread of infection  sera cross-neutralizing activity of patients previously infected with conventional SARS-CoV-2 against novel variants is important but has not been firmly established. METHODS: We investigated the neutralizing potency of 81 coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  patients’ sera from the first to fourth waves of the pandemic against SARS-CoV-2 D614G  B.1.1.7  P.1  and B.1.351 variants using their authentic viruses. RESULTS: Most sera had neutralizing activity against all variants  showing similar activity against B.1.1.7 and D614G  but lower activity especially against B.1.351. In the fourth wave  sera-neutralizing activity against B.1.1.7 was significantly higher than that against any other variants  including D614G. The sera-neutralizing activity in less severe patients was lower than that of more severe patients for all variants. CONCLUSIONS: The cross-neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was effective against all variants but was potentially weaker for B.1.351. The high neutralizing activity specific to B.1.1.7 in the fourth wave suggests that mutations in the virus might cause conformational change of its spike protein  which affects immune recognition of D614G. Our results indicate that individuals who recover from COVID-19 could be protected from the severity caused by infection with newly emerging variants.

Among members aged ≥12 years of a large integrated health care delivery system in Oregon and Washington  incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  emergency department  ED  visits  and hospitalizations were calculated by COVID-19 vaccination status  vaccine product  age  race  and ethnicity. Infection after full vaccination was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result ≥14 days after completion of an authorized COVID-19 vaccination series.* During the July-September 2021 surveillance period  SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among 4 146 of 137 616 unvaccinated persons  30.1 per 1 000 persons  and 3 009 of 344 848 fully vaccinated persons  8.7 per 1 000 . Incidence was higher among unvaccinated persons than among vaccinated persons across all demographic strata. Unvaccinated persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more than twice as likely to receive ED care  18.5%  or to be hospitalized  9.0%  than were vaccinated persons with COVID-19  8.1% and 3.9%  respectively . The crude mortality rate was also higher among unvaccinated patients  0.43 per 1 000  than in fully vaccinated patients  0.06 per 1 000 . These data support CDC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination  including additional and booster doses  to protect individual persons and communities against COVID-19  including illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant  1 .

Genomic surveillance has greatly aided the detection and tracking of the virus and the identification of the variants of concern  VOC . The knowledge and understanding from genomic surveillance is important for a populous country like India for public health and healthcare officials for advance planning. An integrative analysis of the publicly available datasets in GISAID from India reveals the differential distribution of clades  lineages  gender  and age over a year  Apr 2020–Mar 2021 . The significant insights include the early evidence towards B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 lineages in the specific states of India. Pan-India longitudinal data highlighted that B.1.36* was the predominant clade in India until January–February 2021 after which it has gradually been replaced by the B.1.617.1 lineage  from December 2020 onward. Regional analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicated that B.1.617.3 was first seen in India in the month of October in the state of Maharashtra  while the now most prevalent strain B.1.617.2 was first seen in Bihar and subsequently spread to the states of Maharashtra  Gujarat  and West Bengal. To enable a real time understanding of the transmission and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes  we built a transmission map available on https:  covid19-indiana.soic.iupui.edu India EmergingLineages April2020 to March2021. Based on our analysis  the rate estimate for divergence in our dataset was 9.48 e-4 substitutions per site year for SARS-CoV-2. This would enable pandemic preparedness with the addition of future sequencing data from India available in the public repositories for tracking and monitoring the VOCs and variants of interest  VOI . This would help aid decision making from the public health perspective.

In this study  we describe a severely immunosuppressed individual with HIV-1 SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with a long-term course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 28-year-old man was diagnosed with HIV-1 infection  CD4+ count: 3 cells µL nd 563000 HIV-1 RNA copies mL  and simultaneous Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia  disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positivity from nasopharyngeal samples was prolonged for 15 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 was identified as variant Alpha  PANGO lineage B.1.1.7  with mutation S:E484K. Spike-specific T-cell response was similar to HIV-negative controls although enriched in IL-2  and showed disproportionately increased immunological exhaustion marker levels. Despite persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection  adaptive intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution  was not identified. Spike-specific T-cell response protected against a severe COVID-19 outcome and the increased immunological exhaustion marker levels might have favoured SARS-CoV-2 persistence.

We previously showed protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease and pneumonia in hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Here  we observe a 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 do not lose weight compared to control animals. In contrast to control animals  the lungs of vaccinated animals do not show any gross lesions. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA  sgRNA  and no infectious virus can be detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation shows extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals  but none in the vaccinated animals. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against clinical disease caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 VOCs.

Herein  we developed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the changes occurring upon mutations in the viral spike. We focused on mutants located in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and analyzed whether these mutants modulate the interaction with the human host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II  ACE2 . Thirty-two highly prevalent mutants were retrieved from the GISAID database  and their structural models were built using the SWISS-Model server. The stabilization effect for each mutation was assessed by the DUET and DeepDGG software. By applying molecular docking using both Z-Dock and Haddock software we found that multiple mutations  including A475V  V455E  V445L  and V445I  resulted in the higher binding free energy as compared to the wild type  WT  spike protein  thus had a destabilizing effect on the binding to ACE2. On the other hand  several mutants  including the most prevalent N501Y and B.1.1.7 variants  as well as the K444R  L455F  Q493R  and Y505W variants exhibited lower binding free energy as compared to the WT spike. These mutants showed an increased number of electrostatic interactions with ACE2 than the WT spike protein  and they changed the interaction pattern of the neighboring residues. Together  the results presented in this study contribute to a better understanding of the changes in the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the human host ACE2 receptor associated with point mutations in the viral spike protein.

METHODS: Whole genome sequencing  cycle threshold  Ct  values  infectious virus  anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G  IgG  levels  and clinical chart reviews were combined to characterize SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the National Capital Region between January and September 2021 and differentiate infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals by the Delta  Alpha  and B.1.2  the predominant lineage prior to Alpha  variants. RESULTS: The Delta variant displaced the Alpha variant to constitute 99% of the circulating lineages in the National Capital Region by August 2021. In Delta infections  28.5% were breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated individuals compared to 4% in the Alpha infected cohort. Breakthrough infections in both cohorts were associated with comorbidities  but only Delta infections were associated with a significant increase in the median days after vaccination. More than 74% of Delta samples had infectious virus compared to <30% from the Alpha cohort. The recovery of infectious virus with both variants was associated with low levels of local SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with the Delta variant was associated with more frequent recovery of infectious virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals compared to the Alpha variant but was not associated with an increase in disease severity in fully vaccinated individuals. Infectious virus was correlated with the presence of low amounts of antiviral IgG in the nasal specimens.

We have examined the structure and receptor binding properties of spike proteins from the B.1.1.7  Alpha  and B.1.351  Beta  variants to better understand the evolution of the virus in humans. Spikes of both variants have the same mutation  N501Y  in the receptor-binding domains. This substitution confers tighter ACE2 binding  dependent on the common earlier substitution  D614G. Each variant spike has acquired other key changes in structure that likely impact virus pathogenesis. The spike from the Alpha variant is more stable against disruption upon binding ACE2 receptor than all other spikes studied. This feature is linked to the acquisition of a more basic substitution at the S1-S2 furin site  also observed for the variants of concern Delta  Kappa  and Omicron  which allows for near-complete cleavage. In the Beta variant spike  the presence of a new substitution  K417N  also observed in the Omicron variant   in combination with the D614G  stabilises a more open spike trimer  a conformation required for receptor binding. Our observations suggest ways these viruses have evolved to achieve greater transmissibility in humans.

In this study  we report on 2634 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from infected patients in Qatar between March-2020 and March-2021  representing 1.5% of all positive cases in this period. Despite the restrictions on international travel  the viruses sampled from the populace of Qatar mirrored nearly the entire global population’s genomic diversity with nine predominant viral lineages that were sustained by local transmission chains and the emergence of mutations that are likely to have originated in Qatar. We reported an increased number of mutations and deletions in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages in a short period. These findings raise the imperative need to continue the ongoing genomic surveillance that has been an integral part of the national response to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 profile and re-emergence in Qatar.

DESIGN: This is a modelling study combining estimates of real-time reproduction number R t   derived from UK case  death and serological survey data  with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from tiers. SETTING: The UK at lower tier local authority  LTLA  level. 310 LTLAs were included in the analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in real-time reproduction number R t . RESULTS: Nationally  transmission increased between July and late September  regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system  R t  averaged 1.3  0.9–1.6  across LTLAs  but declined to an average of 1.1  0.86–1.42  2 weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3  respectively  reduced transmission by 6%  5%–7%  and 23%  21%–25% . 288 LTLAs  93%  would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into tier 3 by the second national lockdown  whereas only 90  29%  did so in reality. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as tier 3 are required to suppress transmission  especially considering more transmissible variants  at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.

A new strategy involves the intradermal administration of heterologous vaccines composed of one or two doses of inactivated vaccine and a booster dose with the mutated S1 protein  K-S . Such vaccines improve the immune efficacy by increasing the neutralizing antibody titers and promoting specific T cell responses against five variants of the RBD protein. A viral challenge test with the B.1.617.2  Delta  variant confirmed that both administration schedules  i.e. “1 + 1” and “2 + 1”  ensured protection against this strain. These results suggest that the aforementioned strategy is effective for protecting against new variants and enhances the anamnestic immune response in the immunized population.

We evaluated in mice the protective efficacy of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine against BA.1 before or after boosting. Whereas two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against historical WA1 2020 strains  lower levels against BA.1 were associated with breakthrough infection and inflammation in the lung. A primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273.529  an Omicron-matched vaccine  potently neutralized BA.1 but inhibited historical or other SARS-CoV-2 variants less effectively. However  boosting with either mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 vaccines increased neutralizing titers and protection against BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Nonetheless  the neutralizing antibody titers were higher  and lung viral burden and cytokines were slightly lower in mice boosted with mRNA-1273.529 and challenged with BA.1. Thus  boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 enhances protection against Omicron infection with limited differences in efficacy measured.

We aimed to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and compare this with the risk in adults  by analysis of national testing data for England. Methods In our prospective  national surveillance study to assess reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in children in England  we used national SARS-CoV-2 testing data to estimate the risk of reinfection at least 90 days after primary infection from Jan 27  2020  to July  31  2021  which encompassed the alpha  B.1.1.7  and delta  B.1.617.2  variant waves in England. Data from children up to age 16 years who met the criteria for reinfection were included. Disease severity was assessed by linking reinfection cases to national hospital admission data  intensive care admission  and death registration datasets. Findings Reinfection rates closely followed community infection rates  with a small peak during the alpha wave and a larger peak during the delta wave. In children aged 16 years and younger  688 418 primary infections and 2343 reinfections were identified. The overall reinfection rate was 66·88 per 100 000 population  which was higher in adults  72·53 per 100 000  than children  21·53 per 100 000 . The reinfection rate after primary infection was 0·68% overall  0·73% in adults compared with 0·18% in children age younger than 5 years  0·24% in those aged 5–11 years  and 0·49% in those aged 12–16 years. Of the 109 children admitted to hospital with reinfection  78  72%  had comorbidities. Hospital admission rates were similar for the first  64 [2·7%] of 2343  and second episode  57 [2·4%] of 2343  and intensive care admissions were rare  seven children for the first episode and four for reinfections . There were 44 deaths within 28 days after primary infection  0·01%  and none after reinfection. Interpretation The risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is strongly related to exposure due to community infection rates  especially during the delta variant wave. Children had a lower risk of reinfection than did adults  but reinfections were not associated with more severe disease or fatal outcomes. Funding UK Health Security Agency.

Multiple established diagnostic companies are now providing testing platforms whereas initially  testing was being performed with simple PCR-based tests using standard laboratory reagents. Recent Findings Additional testing platforms continue to be developed  including those to detect specific variants  but challenges with testing  including obtaining testing reagents and other related supplies  are frequently encountered. With time  the testing supply chain has improved  and more established companies are providing materials to support these testing efforts. In the United States  U.S.   the need for rapid assay development and subsequent approval through the attainment of emergency use authorization  EUA  has superseded the traditional arduous diagnostic testing approval workflow mandated by the FDA. Through these efforts  the U.S. has been able to continue to significantly increase its testing capabilities to address this pandemic; however  challenges still remain due to the diversity of the performance characteristics of tests being utilized and newly discovered viral variants. Summary This review provides an overview of the current diagnostic testing landscape  with pertinent information related to SARS-CoV-2 virology  variants and antibody responses that are available to diagnose infection in the U.S.

COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Hospitalizations and Deaths in the Veterans Health Administration,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofab466.098,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.098,,pmc:PMC8644943,Open Forum Infect Dis,2021,98. COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Hospitalizations and Deaths in the Veterans Health Administration,BACKGROUND: A COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection is defined as SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected ≥ 14 days after completion of a final vaccine dose. CDC’s May 25 MMWR report of 10 262 vaccine breakthrough infections in the U.S. is likely an underestimate. Herein  we report Veterans Health Administration  VHA  breakthrough cases  focusing on hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS: We extracted COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections tested between 1 19 2021 and 4 30 2021 from the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse  including screening tests . We reviewed medical records of cases who died and or were hospitalized within 14 days of SARS-CoV-2 positive test for clinician documentation of conditions deemed high risk for COVID-19 and to confirm hospitalization or death was related to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing  Clear Labs platform  and antigen testing  Abbott BinaxNOW  from available patient samples were performed and Pangolin lineage determined. RESULTS: 1 142 COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections were identified. 357 1 142  31.3%  were hospitalized and or died. 1 085  95%  were male  Table 1   and median age was 72.5 years  74 years for hospitalized deceased patients . COVID-19 infection contributed to hospitalization and or death in 139  38.9%  cases. The remaining 218  61.1%  were hospitalized or died of causes apparently unrelated to COVID-19. Smoking and heart conditions were seen most frequently among hospitalized deceased breakthrough cases  Table 2 . Variant B.1.1.7 was predominant  present in 17 27  63%  total samples sequenced  and 13 21  61.9%  hospitalized deceased.  Table 3 . Of 21 sequenced hospitalized deceased cases  SARS-CoV-2 antigen positivity was present in 11  52.4% . [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Compared to CDC reported breakthrough infections  VHA cases were more male  older  and hospitalized died at higher frequency. Further study is needed to determine the contribution of specific underlying conditions  COVID-19 vaccine formulations and variants on hospitalization and death among COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections. Sequencing efforts for breakthrough cases should be intensified  particularly for those presenting with more severe infections. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures

In this study  we tested a panel of anti-receptor-binding domain monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology  S309  the parent mAb of VIR-7831  sotrovimab    AstraZeneca  COV2-2196 and COV2-2130  the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061   Regeneron  REGN10933 and REGN10987   Eli Lilly  LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016  and Celltrion  CT-P59  for their ability to neutralize an infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate. Several mAbs  LY-CoV555  LY-CoV016  REGN10933  REGN10987 and CT-P59  completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells  whereas others were reduced  COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination  ~12-fold decrease  or minimally affected  S309 . Our results suggest that several  but not all  of the antibodies in clinical use might lose efficacy against the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant.

In this study  changes in the epitopes of spike and orf8 proteins in SARS‐CoV‐2 of B.1.1.7 lineage were investigated. Genomic alignment of the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 with SARS‐CoV‐2 Wuhan showed the presence of several mutations in orf1a b  spike  orf8  and N proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7. Molecular models of spike and orf8 proteins were constructed by homology modeling. Superimposition between the spike proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 Wuhan and SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 showed noticeable variations in the spatial orientation in Val70‐Asn74 and Thr250‐Ser255 regions. This may have also resulted in the extension of the epitopic region at Ser244‐Gly249 in the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 spike protein. Superimposition of the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 spike protein over Fab‐spike protein complexes of SARS‐CoV‐2 Wuhan also showed subtle variations in the antibody binding affinity targeting the N‐terminal domain of the spike protein. Epitopic variations were also observed between the corresponding orf8 regions of SARS‐CoV‐2 Wuhan and SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7. Moreover  the presence of a stop codon at position 27 in orf8 connotes the emergence of two frames  orf8a and orf8b  in SARS‐CoV‐2  which further hampers its extracellular secretion  and in turn  immunogenicity. The findings of the present study could further be used to develop targeted immunotherapeutics.

We report on the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype with nine mutations including D614G T307I double-mutation of the spike. This variant expanded and completely replaced previous lineages within a short period in the subantarctic Magallanes Region  southern Chile. The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases  resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain  interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G. Continuous surveillance of new mutations and molecular analyses of such variations are important tools to understand the molecular mechanisms defining infectivity and virulence of current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The antibodies recognized and potently neutralized a panel of different Spike variants including Alpha  Delta  Epsilon  Eta and A.23.1  but to a lesser extent Beta and Gamma. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co-immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site  the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly  the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.

Here  we derive airway organoids from human pluripotent stem cells  hPSC-AOs . The hPSC-AOs  particularly ciliated-like cells  are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using this platform  we perform a high content screen and identify GW6471  which blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. GW6471 can also block infection of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant. RNA-seq analysis suggests that GW6471 blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part by inhibiting HIF1α  which is further validated by chemical inhibitor and genetic perturbation targeting HIF1α. Metabolic profiling identifies decreased rates of glycolysis upon GW6471 treatment  consistent with transcriptome profiling. Finally  xanthohumol  5- Tetradecyloxy -2-furoic acid  and ND-646  three compounds that suppress fatty acid biosynthesis  also block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together  a high content screen coupled with transcriptome and metabolic profiling reveals a key role of the HIF1α-glycolysis axis in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium.

To address these issues  we used lentiviruses pseudotyped by variant spikes to measure their neutralization by convalescent sera  vaccine-elicited and Regeneron therapeutic antibodies and ACE2 affinity. Convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies neutralized viruses with Delta spike with 2-5-fold decrease in titer in different donors. Regeneron antibody cocktail neutralized virus with the Delta spike with a 2.6-fold decrease in titer. Neutralization resistance to serum antibodies and monoclonal antibodies was mediated by L452R mutation. These relatively modest decreases in antibody neutralization titer for viruses with variant spike proteins suggest that current vaccines will remain protective against the family of Delta variants.

During the first wave  diagnostics were largely based on reverse transcription-linked PCR  RT-PCR . The Abbott PanBio antigen test was deployed during the 2nd wave which may have been driven by emergence of the B.1.351 variant. At the time of evaluation in mid-November 2020  B.1.351 was the dominant circulating virus in Nelson Mandela Bay  in the Eastern Cape Province. Methods : Used PanBio antigen swabs  collected from patients with genetically characterised virus  were first validated as suitable for PCR. A prospective study was then undertaken to evaluate assay performance in the field. Testing was conducted at mobile community testing centres on 677 ambulant patients. Used swabs were kept and tested by RT-PCR. Results : During initial validation  used swabs in proprietary lysis buffer were found to be suitable for PCR and secondly  the PB assay reliably detected patients infected with B.1.351. In the field study  of 146 RT-PCR positive individuals  101 were RTD positive in the clinic. The RTD had a sensitivity of 69.2%  95%CI 61.4  75.8  and specificity of 99.0%  95%CI 98.8  99.3 . Sensitivity was dependent on the amount of viral RNA in clinical samples  as reflected by the PCR cycle threshold  CT  value. Conclusions : The assay reliably detected B.1.351 infections in ambulatory ill patients during initial validation and in field testing. In the field  assay sensitivity was >90% in patients with high viral loads who are expected to be most infectious. Negative and positive predictive values were also >90%.

We characterized seven anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain  RBD  antibodies for binding activity  pairing capability  and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 and three variant RBDs via lateral flow immunoassays. The results allowed us to group these antibodies into three distinct epitope bins. Our studies showed that two antibodies had broadly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and these variant RBDs and that one antibody did not neutralize the South African  SA  and Brazilian P.1  BR P.1  RBDs. The antibody escaped by the SA and BR P.1 RBDs retained binding activity to SA and BR P.1 RBDs but was unable to induce neutralization. We demonstrated that lateral flow immunoassay could be a rapid and effective tool for antibody characterization  including epitope classification and antibody neutralization kinetics. The potential contributions of the mutations  N501Y  E484K  and K417N T  contained in these variants’ RBDs to the antibody pairing capability  neutralization activity  and therapeutic antibody targeting strategy are discussed.

This study investigated binding antibody responses and neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants  in patients with COVID-19 who had been fully vaccinated with CoronaVac  n = 77   individuals who had been fully vaccinated with CoronaVac but had not contracted COVID-19  n = 170   and individuals who had received AZD1222 as a third vaccination  n = 210 . Breakthrough infection was generally detected approximately 88 days after the second CoronaVac vaccination  interquartile range 68–100 days . Blood samples were collected at a median of 34 days after infection. Binding antibody levels in sera from patients with breakthrough infection were significantly higher than those in individuals who had received AZD1222 as a third vaccination. However  neutralizing activities against wild-type and variants  including alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   and delta  B.1.617.2   were comparable in patients with breakthrough infections and individuals who received a third vaccination with AZD1222  which exceeds 90%. Omicron  B.1.1.529  was neutralized less effectively by serum from breakthrough infection patients  with a 6.3-fold reduction compared to delta variants. The study suggests that breakthrough infection after two doses of an inactivated vaccine can induce neutralizing antibodies against omicron. Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term persistence of antibodies against the omicron variant.

Most of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines use the prototype strain-derived spike  S  protein or its receptor-binding domain  RBD  as the vaccine antigen. The emergence of several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about potential immune escape. In this study  we performed an immunogenicity comparison of prototype strain-derived RBD  S1  and S ectodomain trimer  S-trimer  antigens and evaluated their induction of neutralizing antibodies against three circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants  including B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.617.1. We found that  at the same antigen dose  the RBD and S-trimer vaccines were more potent than the S1 vaccine in eliciting long-lasting  high-titer broadly neutralizing antibodies in mice. The RBD immune sera remained highly effective against the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and B.1.617.1 variants despite the corresponding neutralizing titers decreasing by 1.2-  2.8-  and 3.5-fold relative to that against the wild-type strain. Significantly  the S-trimer immune sera exhibited comparable neutralization potency  less than twofold variation in neutralizing GMTs  towards the prototype strain and all three variants tested. These findings provide valuable information for further development of recombinant protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and support the continued use of currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the regions countries where variant viruses circulate.

The nomenclature to design the variants uses a colloquial form referred to the country or place of detection  a code from the “Pangolin” database and one from the “Nextstrain” page. New variants that have spread include the British B.1.1.7  20I 501Y.V1   the South African B.1.351  20H 501.V2   the Brazilian P.1  20J 501Y.V3   the Californians B.1.427 B.1.429  20C S:452R  and the most recent  the Indian B.1.617  VUI-21APR-01 . The gold standard for the identification of the variants is whole genome sequencing. However  real-time PCR techniques have already been developed for the detection of specific mutations that can facilitate their presumptive identification. The impact of these variants on global vaccination programs has raised concern. It is generally thought that  since the response evoked by the vaccine against the S antigen is directed at the entire protein and the mutations only affect specific regions  the escape effect of the vaccine antibodies will be limited. Among the future strategies proposed for immuno-protection  the increase in the number of doses  the alternation of vaccines and the development of specific vaccines against different variants has been suggested.

More recently  novel SARS-CoV-2 variants have been spreading around the world  and there is growing concern that they may have higher transmissibility and that the protective efficacy of vaccines may be weaker against them. Immediate measures are needed to reduce human exposure to the virus. In this study  the antiviral efficacy of deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode  DUV-LED  irradiation  280 ± 5 nm  3.75 mW cm 2   against three SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated. For the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variant strains  irradiation of the virus stocks for 1 s resulted in infectious titer reduction rates of 96.3%  94.6%  and 91.9%  respectively  and with irradiation for 5 s  the rates increased to 99.9%  99.9%  and 99.8%  respectively. We also tested the effect of pulsed DUV-LED irradiation  7.5 mW cm 2   duty rate: 50%  frequency: 1 kHz  under the same output conditions as for continuous irradiation and found that the antiviral efficacy of pulsed and continuous irradiation was the same. These findings suggest that by further developing and optimizing the DUV-LED device to increase its output  it may be possible to instantly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with DUV-LED irradiation.

Named B.1.427 B.1.429 to denote its 2 lineages  the variant emerged around May 2020 and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from September 1  2020 to January 29  2021  exhibiting an 18.6-24% increase in transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains. The variant carries 3 mutations in the spike protein  including an L452R substitution. Our analyses revealed 2-fold increased B.1.427 B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and increased L452R pseudovirus infection of cell cultures and lung organoids  albeit decreased relative to pseudoviruses carrying the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 variants. Antibody neutralization assays showed 4.0 to 6.7-fold and 2.0-fold decreases in neutralizing titers from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients  respectively. The increased prevalence of a more transmissible variant in California associated with decreased antibody neutralization warrants further investigation.

Here  we identified lactoferrin  LF   mucin1  MUC1  and α-lactalbumin  α-LA  from human breastmilk inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system and transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles  trVLP . Additionally  LF and MUC1 inhibited multiple steps including viral attachment  entry and post-entry replication  while α-LA inhibited viral attachment and entry. Importantly  LF  MUC1 and α-LA possessed potent antiviral activities towards variants such as B.1.1.7  alpha   B.1.351  beta   P.1  gamma  and B.1.617.1  kappa . Taken together  our study provides evidence that human breastmilk components  LF  MUC1 and α-LA  are promising antiviral and potential therapeutic candidates warranting further development or treating COVID-19.

All variants of SARS-CoV-2  including the globally and currently dominant Delta variant  Delta-SARS-CoV-2   caused severe disease and mortality. Among all variants  Delta-SARS-CoV-2 had the highest transmissibility  growth rate  and secondary attack rate than other variants except for the new variant of Omicron that still exists with many unknown effects. In Taiwan  the pandemic Delta-SARS-CoV-2 began in Pingtung from 14 June 2021 and ceased at 11 July 2021. Seventeen patients were infected by Delta-SARS-CoV-2 and 1 person died during the Pingtung outbreak. The Public Health Bureau of Pingtung County Government stopped the Delta-SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within 1 month through measures such as epidemic investigation  rapid gene sequencing  rapidly expanding isolation  expanded screening of the Delta-SARS-CoV-2 antigen for people who lived in regional villages  and indirect intervention  including rapid vaccination  short lockdown period  and travel restrictions. Indirect environmental factors  such as low levels of air pollution  tropic weather in the summer season  and rural areas might have accelerated the ability to control the Delta-SARS-CoV-2 spread. This successful experience might be recommended as a successful formula for the unvaccinated or insufficiently vaccinated regions.

Anti-spike antibody levels can determine which patients develop antibodies at levels similar to healthy controls  and are a known correlate of protection. CASE REPORT: A multiple myeloma patient developed protective anti-spike antibodies after vaccination  608 IU mL   but nonetheless developed severe breakthrough COVID-19 just 10 weeks following his second vaccination with mRNA-1273. RESULTS: Sequencing of the viral isolate revealed an extensively mutated variant with 10 spike protein mutations  including E484Q and N440K. Serology testing showed a dramatic decline in anti-spike antibodies immediately prior to virus exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple myeloma patients who do develop detectable antibody responses to vaccination may be at increased risk for breakthrough infections due to rapid decline in antibody levels. Viral variants with immune escape mutations such as N440K  also seen independently in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant  B.1.1.529  and in viral passaging experiments  likely require a higher level of anti-spike antibodies to prevent severe COVID-19.

Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7  we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States  U.S.   tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure  SGTF   first observed in the U.K.  was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state  detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere  with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses  we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020  with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant  requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

The active immunization was monitored by systemic antibody titration and continuous surveillance was guaranteed by antigenic molecular tests on swabs. Cases of infection have been recently observed in vaccinated healthcare workers. Herein we describe an outbreak of infection occurring in five physicians out of 656 healthcare workers belonging to a private hospital  referring mild symptoms of COVID-19. Healthcare workers underwent complete vaccination and screening for antibody titration. Five out of 656 healthcare workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs and referred mild COVID-19 symptoms. Molecular analyses were carried out to identify possible variants of Spike protein. Their genotyping performed on RNA extracts highlighted the presence of del69 70  N501Y  A570D  and 1841A > G  D614G  sequence variants  all indicative of VOC 202012 01-lineage B.1.1.7  suggesting a common source of infection. These cases might represent a serious emergency because outbreaks can compromise frail patients with important concomitant diseases.

In the second epidemic wave in Nigeria  the roles of co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 Alpha  ie  B.1.1.7  and Eta  ie  B.1.525  variants in contributing to the epidemiological outcomes were of public health concerns for investigation. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to capture the transmission dynamics of different types of strains in Nigeria. By fitting to the national-wide COVID-19 surveillance data  the transmission advantages of SARS-CoV-2 variants were estimated by likelihood-based inference framework. RESULTS: The reproduction numbers were estimated to decrease steadily from 1.5 to 0.8 in the second epidemic wave. In December 2020  when both Alpha and Eta variants were at low prevalent levels  their transmission advantages  against the wild type  were estimated at 1.51  95% credible intervals  CrI  = 1.48  1.54   and 1.56  95% CrI = 1.54  1.59   respectively. In January 2021  when the original variants almost vanished  we estimated a weak but significant transmission advantage of Eta against Alpha variants with 1.14  95% CrI = 1.11  1.16 . CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested evidence of the transmission advantages for both Alpha and Eta variants  of which Eta appeared slightly more infectious than Alpha. We highlighted the critical importance of COVID-19 control measures in mitigating the outbreak size and relaxing the burdens to health care systems in Nigeria.

In December 2020  the B.1.617.2  delta  variant concern  VOC  was first reported in India  and rapidly spread around the globe  is now the main brand in the United Kingdom  and it has grown dramatically. Here we present the clinical features and laboratory findings of the first case of B. 1.617.2  delta  variant concern  VOC  in Iraq. A 6-year-old female child presented with severe abdominal pain  headache  severe vomiting  and diarrhea  runny nose  alerted mental status  loss of appetite  and fever. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 delta variant B.1.617.2 by RT-PCR. The patient was treated by administration of glucose saline 4% for 3 days  ceftriaxone vial 1 mg every 12 h for 6 days  and an acetaminophen bottle on a need to prevent fever followed by a Flagyl bottle every 24 h for 3 days. Vaccination and prevention the spread of the virus and against it are important preventive approaches for delta variant. Sore throat  runny nose  headache  and vomiting  diarrhea are the major clinical features of the delta variant. This was followed by an elevation of the leukocyte WBC  and blood platelets. To reduce the impact of new delta variant B.1.617.2 infection; handwashing  wearing a double mask  avoiding crowded and closed settings  social distancing  lockdown  and ensuring good ventilation are major significant options against this variant.

During late 2020  prisons in England observed a surge in COVID-19 infection. This study describes the emergence of the Alpha variant in prisons during this period. Methods Alpha and non-Alpha variant COVID-19 cases were identified in prisoners in England using address-matched laboratory notifications and genomic information from COG-UK. Results Of 14 094 COVID-19 positive prisoner cases between 1st October 2020 – 28th March 2021  11.5%  n=1 621  had sequencing results. Of these  1 082  66.7%  were identified as the Alpha variant. 29  2.7%  Alpha cases required hospitalisation compared to only 5  1.0%; p=0.02  non-Alpha cases. A total of 14 outbreaks were identified with the median attack rate higher for Alpha  17.9%  IQR 3.2% - 32.2%; p=0.11  than non-Alpha outbreaks  3.5%  IQR 2.0% - 10.2% . Conclusion Higher attack rates and increased likelihood of hospitalisations were observed for Alpha cases compared to non-Alpha. This suggests a key contribution to the rise in cases  hospitalisations and outbreaks in prisons in the second wave. With prisons prone to COVID-19 outbreaks  and the potential to act as reservoirs for variants of concern  sequencing of prison-associated cases alongside whole-institution vaccination should be prioritised.

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  triggered ADCC responses contributes to COVID-19 disease development is currently not well understood. To understand the potential correlation between ADCC responses and COVID-19 disease development  we analyzed the ADCC activity and neutralizing antibody response in 255 individuals ranging from asymptomatic to fatal infections over 1 year post disease. ADCC was elicited by 10 days post-infection  peaked by 11–20 days  and remained detectable until 400 days post-infection. In general  patients with severe disease had higher ADCC activities. Notably  patients who had severe disease and recovered had higher ADCC activities than patients who had severe disease and deceased. Importantly  ADCC activities were mediated by a diversity of epitopes in SARS-COV-2-infected mice and induced to comparable levels against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs   B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1  as that against the D614G mutant in human patients and vaccinated mice. Our study indicates anti-SARS-CoV-2 ADCC as a major trait of COVID-19 patients with various conditions  which can be applied to estimate the extra-neutralization level against COVID-19  especially lethal COVID-19.

Despite group cohorting  cases occurred in almost all groups  i.e. also among persons without close contact. Children’s secondary attack rates  SAR  were similar to adults  childcare centres: 23% vs 30%; p = 0.15; households: 32% vs 39%; p = 0.27 ; child- and adult-induced household outbreaks also led to similar SAR. With the advent of B.1.1.7  susceptibility and infectiousness of children and adults seem to converge. Public health measures should be revisited accordingly.

Analysis in rural England,BACKGROUND: It is useful to document whether each newly dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern was more or less dangerous than preceding dominant variant s . We assessed if the emergence of the Alpha  B.1.1.7  variant in autumn 2020 could be linked to higher case fatality rates  compared to original wild-type COVID-19  subgrouping by age band  sex  deprivation or month of diagnosis as potential risk factors. METHODS: Observational study and secondary analysis were conducted of SARS-CoV-2 cases diagnosed due to medical need or occupational exposure in an administrative area of Eastern England  UK  base population 1 million   who first tested positive in the period 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine relationships of age group  sex  deprivation group and month of diagnosis with case fatality rates within 28 days of diagnosis. Marginal probabilities for risk of dying were calculated separately for the first two main ‘wave’ periods of the English pandemic. RESULTS: Older age and male sex consistently raised the risk of mortality in both wave periods. Higher deprivation was linked to mortality risk in the first wave period  but not in the second wave. Mortality decreased over time during the first wave period  but slightly increased over time during the second wave. Cases were younger in the second wave  and median age of the deceased varied little between waves. INTERPRETATION: The Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 did not lead to higher mortality rates for any age  deprivation or sex group  compared to case fatality rates in the early part of the pandemic period.

We therefore aimed to characterise the sensitivity of the omicron variant to neutralisation. Methods For this cross-sectional study  we cloned the sequence encoding the omicron spike protein from a diagnostic sample to establish an omicron pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. We quantified the neutralising antibody ID50  the reciprocal dilution that produces 50% inhibition  against the omicron spike protein  and the fold-change in ID50 relative to the spike of wild-type SARS-CoV-2  ie  the pandemic founder variant   for one convalescent reference plasma pool  WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin [20 136]   three reference serum pools from vaccinated individuals  and two cohorts from Stockholm  Sweden: one comprising previously infected hospital workers  17 sampled in November  2021  after vaccine rollout and nine in June or July  2020  before vaccination  and one comprising serum from 40 randomly sampled blood donors donated during week 48  Nov 29–Dec 5  of 2021. Furthermore  we assessed the neutralisation of omicron by five clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies  mAbs . Findings Neutralising antibody responses in reference sample pools sampled shortly after infection or vaccination were substantially less potent against the omicron variant than against wild-type SARS-CoV-2  seven-fold to 42-fold reduction in ID50 titres . Similarly  for sera obtained before vaccination in 2020 from a cohort of convalescent hospital workers  neutralisation of the omicron variant was low to undetectable  all ID50 titres <20 . However  in serum samples obtained in 2021 from two cohorts in Stockholm  substantial cross-neutralisation of the omicron variant was observed. Sera from 17 hospital workers after infection and subsequent vaccination had a reduction in average potency of only five-fold relative to wild-type SARS-CoV-2  geometric mean ID50 titre 495 vs 105   and two donors had no reduction in potency. A similar pattern was observed in randomly sampled blood donors  n=40   who had an eight-fold reduction in average potency against the omicron variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2  geometric mean ID50 titre 369 vs 45 . We found that the omicron variant was resistant to neutralisation  50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] >10 μg mL  by mAbs casirivimab  REGN-10933   imdevimab  REGN-10987   etesevimab  Ly-CoV016   and bamlanivimab  Ly-CoV555   which form part of antibody combinations used in the clinic to treat COVID-19. However  S309  the parent of sotrovimab  retained most of its activity  with only an approximately two-fold reduction in potency against the omicron variant compared with ancestral D614G SARS-CoV-2  IC50 0·1–0·2 μg mL . Interpretation These data highlight the extensive  but incomplete  evasion of neutralising antibody responses by the omicron variant  and suggest that boosting with licensed vaccines might be sufficient to raise neutralising antibody titres to protective levels.

In previous reports we hypothesized that the worse outcome of the COVID-19 disease in diabetes mellitus condition could be related to the non-enzymatic glycation of ACE2 receptor and an in silico evaluation led to the demonstration that the number of interactions is decreased in comparison to the unmodified model  possibly shifting the virus attack through different  multiple alternative entry routes. Given the evidenced features of this variant  we aimed to investigate with a computational approach the characteristics of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 with respect to its binding to human ACE-2 receptor  in a particular population  namely people affected by diabetes mellitus  at risk for unfavorable outcomes of the COVID-19. The computational analysis  considering the case in which all the lysine residues in the system are subjected to non-enzymatic glycation  confirmed that lysine glycation causes a general loss of interactivity between wild-type  WT -Spike-RBD and ACE2. In the Omicron variant  Lys417 mutates into an asparagine  preventing the possible non-enzymatic glycation of this residue. Therefore  if non-enzymatic glycation seemed to cause a shift in the way in which the virus enters the cell from the ACE2-mediated mechanism to other pathways  in the case of the Omicron variant the ACE2-mediated approach of the virus seems to remain an important event to take into account. Indeed  interaction profile analysis  together with molecular mechanics–generalized Born surface area  MM-GBSA  calculations  suggests that the Omicron-Spike-RBD maintains a higher affinity for ACE2 subsequently to non-enzymatic glycation with respect to WT-Spike-RBD. The finding of the present computational study may suggest a different clinical relevance of the Omicron variant for the diabetes mellitus field  also in the possible direction of a lower severity of the disease.

METHODS: To evaluate the reactogenicity and humoral as well as cellular immune responses towards most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants after a heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination  we analysed a cohort of 26 clinic employees aged 25-46  median 30.5  years who received a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime followed by a BNT162b2 boost after an 8-week interval. Serological data were compared to a cohort which received homologous BNT162b2 vaccination with a 3-week interval  14 individuals aged 25-65  median 42 . FINDINGS: Self-reported solicited symptoms after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime were in line with previous reports and more severe than after the BNT162b2 boost. Antibody titres increased significantly over time resulting in strong neutralization titres two weeks after the BNT162b2 boost and subsequently slightly decreased over the course of 17 weeks. At the latest time point measured  all analysed sera retained neutralizing activity against the currently dominant Delta  B.1.617.2  variant. Two weeks post boost  neutralizing activity against the Alpha  B.1.1.7  and immune-evading Beta  B.1.351  variant was ∼4-fold higher than in individuals receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. No difference was observed in neutralization of Kappa  B.1.617.1 . In addition  heterologous vaccination induced CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of all analysed variants; Wuhan-Hu-1  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  P.1   and Delta. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion  heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19   BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination is not associated with serious adverse events and induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses. The Alpha  Beta  Delta  and Kappa variants of spike are potently neutralized by sera from all participants and reactive T cells recognize spike peptides of all tested variants. These results suggest that this heterologous vaccination regimen is at least as immunogenic and protective as homologous vaccinations and also offers protection against current variants of concern.

These variants exhibit increased transmissibility  cause more severe disease  exhibit evasive immune properties  impair neutralization by antibodies from vaccinated individuals or convalescence sera  and reinfection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  has classified SARS-CoV-2 variants into variants of interest  variants of concern  and variants of high consequence. Currently  four variants of concern  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  P.1  and B.1.617.2  and several variants of interests  B.1.526  B.1.525  and P.2  are characterized and are essential for close monitoring. In this review  we discuss the different SARS-CoV-2 variants  emphasizing variants of concern circulating the world and highlight the various mutations and how these mutations affect the characteristics of the virus. In addition  we discuss the most common vaccines and the various studies concerning the efficacy of these vaccines against different variants of concern.

Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified  one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain  1 2   which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern  VOCs  first identified in South Africa  B.1.351   4  and Brazil  P.1 .* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  DOHMH  analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection  including illness severity  transmission to close contacts  rates of possible reinfection  and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination  breakthrough infection  or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period  the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection. Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts.

Design and Immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 Synthetic DNA Vaccine,BACKGROUND: First-generation COVID-19 vaccines are matched to spike protein of the Wuhan-H1  WT  strain. Convalescent and vaccinee samples show reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC . Next generation DNA vaccines could be matched to single variants or synthetically designed for broader coverage of multiple VOCs. METHODS: The synthetic consensus  SynCon®  sequence for INO-4802 SARS-CoV-2 spike with focused RBD changes and dual proline mutations was codon-optimized  Figure 1 . Sequences for wild-type  pWT  and B.1.351  pB.1.351  were similarly optimized. Immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB c mice. Pre-clinical efficacy was assessed in the Syrian Hamster model. Figure 1. Design Strategy for INO-4802 [Image: see text] RESULTS: INO-4802 induced potent neutralizing antibody responses against WT  B.1.1.7  P.1  and B.1.351 VOC in a murine model. pWT vaccinated animals showed a 3-fold reduction in mean neutralizing ID50 for the B.1.351 pseudotyped virus. INO-4802 immunized animals had significantly higher  p = 0.0408  neutralizing capacity  mean ID50 816.16 . ID50 of pB.1.351 serum was reduced 7-fold for B.1.1.7 and significantly lower  p = 0.0068  than INO-4802  317.44 . INO-4802 neutralized WT  548.28  comparable to pWT. INO-4802 also neutralized P.1  1026.6   Figure 2 . pWT  pB.1.351 or INO-4802 induced similar T-cell responses against all variants. INO-4802 skewed towards a TH1-response. All hamsters vaccinated with INO-4802 or pB.1.351 were protected from weight loss after B.1.351 live virus challenge. 4 6 pWT immunized hamsters were completely protected. pWT immunized hamsters neutralized WT  1090  but not B.1.351  39.16 . INO-4802 neutralized both WT  672.2  and B.1.351  1121   Figure 3 . We observed higher increase of binding titers following heterologous boost with INO-4802  3.6 – 4.4 log2-fold change  than homologous boost with pWT  2.0 – 2.4 log2 fold change   Figure 4 . Figure 2.

Current Status and Challenges,The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people across the world. The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths  with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use  they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore  there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines  BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273  developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics  respectively  have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%  respectively  after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate  with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains  B.1.17 and B.1.351  of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy  safety  and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain  there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation.

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26 th  until March 23 rd . We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline  COVGAP   and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1  83·6%   detected first on March 2 nd   although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1  68·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T  ‘Basel cluster’   including 157 identical sequences at the root of the ‘Basel cluster’  some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree  showing several introduction events from and or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages  such as the first  B.1.1   did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases  with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires  to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations  as well as travel history  to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data  allows connection and interpretation of events  and can inform public health interventions.

COVID-19 was mild or asymptomatic in those experiencing infection. Methods : NtAb was tested before BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  V0   20±2 days after the first dose  V1_20   20±3 days  V2_20  and 90±2 days  V2_90  after the second dose in vaccinated HCW and after about 2 months  N_60   10 months  N_300  and 13 months  N_390  from natural infection in unvaccinated HCW. NtAb was measured by authentic virus neutralization with a SARS-CoV-2 B.1 isolate circulating in Italy at HCW enrolment. Results : Sixty-two HCW were enrolled. NtAb were comparable in infected HCW with no or mild disease at all the study points. NtAb of uninfected HCW were significantly lower with respect to those of previously infected subjects at V1_20  V2_20 and V2_90. The median NtAb fold decrease from V2_20 to V2_90 was higher in the uninfected subjects with respect to subjects with mild infection  6.26 vs 2.58  p=0.03  and to asymptomatic HCW  6.26 vs 3.67  p=0.022 . The median Nabt at N_390 was significantly lower with respect to N_60  p=0.007 . Conclusions : In uninfected subjects completing the two-dose vaccine schedule  a third mRNA vaccine dose is a reasonable option to counteract the substantial NtAb decline occurring at a significantly higher rate compared to previously infected  vaccinated subjects. Although at low level Nabt are still at detectable level after 13 months in two third of previously infected and not vaccinated subjects.

The recent emergence of B.1.1.529  the Omicron variant1 2  which has more than 30 mutations in the spike protein  has raised concerns for escape from protection by vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. A key test for potential countermeasures against B.1.1.529 is their activity in pre-clinical rodent models of respiratory tract disease. Here  using the collaborative network of the SARS-CoV-2 Assessment of Viral Evolution  SAVE  program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  NIAID   we evaluated the ability of multiple B.1.1.529 Omicron isolates to cause infection and disease in immunocompetent and human ACE2  hACE2  expressing mice and hamsters. Despite modeling and binding data suggesting that B.1.1.529 spike can bind more avidly to murine ACE2  we observed attenuation of infection in 129  C57BL 6  and BALB c mice as compared with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants  with limited weight loss and lower viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Although K18-hACE2 transgenic mice sustained infection in the lungs  these animals did not lose weight. In wild-type and hACE2 transgenic hamsters  lung infection  clinical disease  and pathology with B.1.1.529 also were milder compared to historical isolates or other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Overall  experiments from multiple independent laboratories of the SAVE NIAID network with several different B.1.1.529 isolates demonstrate attenuated lung disease in rodents  which parallels preliminary human clinical data.

It is currently unclear whether the previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection with VOCs. Here  we show that low dose aerosol exposure to hCoV-19 human USA WA-CDC-WA1 2020  WA1  lineage A   resulted in a productive mild infection. In contrast  a low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery  hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19 South African KRISP-K005325 2020  VOC B.1.351  via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for three days. They had a little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast  shedding  weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication were observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit the virus to naïve sentinels via direct contact transmission  in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titres against lineage A  but also titres against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore  initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.

Currently designated variants of concern  VOCs  are B.1.1.7  B1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2 variants and B.1.1.529. Possible options for VOC are urgently required as they carry mutations in the virus spike protein that allow them to spread more easily and cause more serious illness. The primary targets for most therapeutic methods against SARS-CoV-2 are the S  Spike  protein and RBD  Receptor-Binding Domain   which alter the binding to ACE2  Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 . The most popular of these strategies involves the use of drug development targeting the RBD and the NTD  N-terminal domain  of the spike protein and multiple epitopes of the S protein. Various types of mutations have been observed in the RBDs of B.1.1.7  B1.351  P. and B.1.620. The incidence of RBD mutations increases the binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The high binding affinity of RBD and ACE2 has provided a structural basis for future evaluation of antibodies and drug development. Here we discuss the variants of SARS-CoV-2 and recent updates on the clinical evaluation of antibody-based treatment options. Presently  most of the antibody-based treatments have been effective in patients with SARS-CoV-2. However  there are still significant challenges in verifying independence  and the need for further clinical evaluation.

Recently  several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants have been found to be more transmissible. They may affect the immune response caused by vaccines and natural infections and reduce the sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. We analyze the distribution characteristics of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and the frequency of mutant sites based on the data available from GISAID and PANGO by R 4.0.2 and ArcGIS 10.2. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1 are more easily spreading than other variants  and the key mutations of S protein  including N501Y  E484K  and K417N T  have high mutant frequencies  which may have become the main genotypes for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In this study  18 monoclonal antibodies  10 sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients  10 inactivated-virus vaccine-elicited sera  14 mRNA vaccine-elicited sera  nine RBD-immunized mouse sera  four RBD-immunized horse sera  and four spike-encoding DNA-immunized guinea pig sera were tested and analyzed. The N501Y  N439K  and S477N mutations caused immune escape from nine of 18 mAbs. However  the convalescent sera  inactivated virus vaccine-elicited sera  mRNA vaccine-elicited sera  spike DNA-elicited sera  and recombinant RBD protein-elicited sera could still neutralize these variants  within three-fold changes compared to the reference D614G variant . The neutralizing antibody responses to different types of vaccines were different  whereby the response to inactivated-virus vaccine was similar to the convalescent sera.

Several mutations have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome  with the spike protein as one of the mutational hot spots. Specific amino acid substitutions such as D614G and N501Y were found to alter the transmissibility and virulence of the virus. The WHO has classified the variants identified with fitness-enhancing mutations as variants of concern  VOC   variants of interest  VOI  or variants under monitoring  VUM . The VOCs pose an imminent threat as they exhibit higher transmissibility  disease severity and ability to evade vaccine-induced and natural immunity. Here we review the mutational landscape on the SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins and their impact on diagnostics  therapeutics and vaccines. We also look at the effectiveness of approved vaccines  antibody therapy and convalescent plasma on the currently prevalent VOCs  which are B.1.17  B.1.351  P.1  B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529. We further discuss the possible factors influencing mutation rates and future directions.

Detecting mutations by specific RT-qPCR is a rapid and affordable alternative to sequencing. However  care must be taken to ensure that the techniques used are up-to-date and adapted to the variants circulating in the studied population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were screened for detection of mutations of the spike protein using the Novaplex™ SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay from week 11 of 2021. Target sought were deletion H69 V70 and mutations N501Y and E484 K. From week 18 we used in addition the new Novaplex™ SARS-CoV-2 Variants II Assay for samples with no targets found with the Variants I assay or with the mutation E484 K alone  in order to screen the mutations L452R  K417 N T and W152C. RESULTS: Between weeks 11 and 25  2239 positive samples out of 54317 were tested with the Variants I Assay. Between weeks 18 and 25  94 samples met the criteria for being tested with the Variants II Assay. Of these  47 had the L452R mutation without the W152C mutation  typical in the B.1.617 variant. At week 25  this profile was found in 45.5% of the samples and was the most frequent. CONCLUSION: According to our observations  variant B.1.617 has become predominant in our institution and most probably in our region. In the absence of the use of the Variants II Assay  they would have been considered wild.

However  a second wave started in November 2020  when an even higher magnitude of deaths hit the city. The arrival of the second wave coincided with the emergence of the Gamma  P.1  variant of SARS-CoV-2  with higher transmissibility  a younger age profile of cases  and a higher hospitalization rate. Prete et al.  2020 MedRxiv 21256644  found that 8 to 33 of 238  3.4–13.9%  repeated blood donors likely were infected twice in Manaus between March 2020 and March 2021. It is unclear how this finding can be used to explain the second wave. We propose a simple model which allows reinfection to explain the two-wave pattern in Manaus. We find that the two waves with 30% and 40% infection attack rates  respectively  and a reinfection ratio at 3.4–13.9%  can explain the two waves well. We argue that the second wave was likely because the city had not exceeded the herd immunity level after the first wave. The reinfection likely played a weak role in causing the two waves.

The spike glycoprotein  an important molecule in the pathogenesis and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 variants  especially omicron B.1.1.529  shows 37 mutations distributed over the trimeric protein domains. Notably  fifteen of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein  which may alter transmissibility and infectivity. Additionally  the omicron spike evades neutralization more efficiently than the delta spike. Most of the therapeutic antibodies are ineffective against the omicron variant  and double immunization with BioNTech-Pfizer  BNT162b2  might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by omicron B.1.1.529. So far  no efficient antiviral drugs are available against omicron. The present study identified the promising inhibitors from seaweed’s bioactive compounds to inhibit the omicron variant B.1.1.529. We have also compared the seaweed’s compounds with the standard drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime  which were suggested as beneficial antiviral drugs in COVID-19 treatment. Our molecular docking analysis revealed that caffeic acid hexoside  −6.4 kcal mol; RMSD = 2.382 Å  and phloretin  −6.3 kcal mol; RMSD = 0.061 Å  from Sargassum wightii  S. wightii  showed the inhibitory effect against the crucial residues ASN417  SER496  TYR501  and HIS505  which are supported for the inviolable omicron and angiotensin-converting enzyme II  ACE2  receptor interaction. Cholestan-3-ol  2-methylene-   3beta  5 alpha   CMBA   −6.0 kcal mol; RMSD = 3.074 Å  from Corallina officinalis  C. officinalis  manifested the strong inhibitory effect against the omicron RBD mutated residues LEU452 and ALA484  was magnificently observed as the essential residues in Indian delta variant B.1.617.2 previously. The standard drugs  ceftriaxone and cefuroxime  showed no or less inhibitory effect against RBD of omicron B.1.1.529. The present study also emphasized the pharmacological properties of the considered chemical compounds. The results could be used to develop potent seaweed-based antiviral drugs and or dietary supplements to treat omicron B.1.1529-infected patients.

At this current point in time there are 4 known major variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus  namely the English variant  B.1.1.7   the South African variant  B.1.351   Brazilian variants  VOC202101 02  P.1  and VUI202101 01  and a variant similar to that of the South African variant found in North America  B.1.526   all of which have varying levels of resistance and infectivity. It is evident that the SARS-CoV-2 variants pose an international health risk  the mutations of E484K and N501Y are the two most implicated mutations. E484K being the most concerning as it aids in immune evasion and drastically causes the efficacy of the current vaccines to be reduced by large margins. The most worrisome variant is the South African or B.1.351 which harbors the above mutations. It is of the upmost importance that targeted vaccines are synthesized to ensure that immunized individuals have effective protection against these variants. Until these specific targeted vaccines are synthesized the current vaccines offer little long-term protection  however do confer a level of immunity to stop severe infections. It is thus advised that current vaccination programs should continue in earnest as a degree of protection is conferred.

Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures  mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike  which reflects  in part  their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly  treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission  implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection  cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission  we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably  despite differences in cell-free infectivity  the variants of concern  VOC  B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover  B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection  whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall  our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission  with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.

Study design A retrospective and nationwide cohort study was conducted in Mexico. Method Data from 26 961 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. Risk ratios  RR  and 95% confidence intervals  IC  were used to evaluate the association of the evaluated exposures with the risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. Results The overall incidence rate of pneumonia was 23.0 per 10 000 person-days  and it was lower during the Delta variant emergence  30.3 vs. 9.4 person-days  p < 0.001 . In multiple analysis  a decreased risk of pneumonia was observed among those cases occurring in May 2021 or later  vs. March 2020 – April 2021  RR = 0.98  95% CI 0.97-0.99  and among older patients  RR per year = 0.998  95% CI 0.996-0.998 . Other comorbidities  namely obesity  chronic kidney disease  diabetes mellitus  immunosuppression  or malignant tumors  were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. Conclusions Our findings suggest that during the Delta variant emergence  children and adolescent patients were at reduced risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in Mexico. Further research is needed to identify factors determining the observed scenario.

The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan  with a special focus on the UK variant of concern. A total of 579 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in Jordan were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Genetic lineage assignment was undertaken using the Pango system. Amino acid substitutions were investigated using the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer  PROVEAN  tool. A total of 19 different SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages were detected  with the most frequent being the first Jordan lineage  B.1.1.312   first detected in August 2020  n = 424  73.2% . This was followed by the second Jordan lineage  B.1.36.10   first detected in September 2020  n = 62  10.7%   and the UK variant of concern  B.1.1.7; n = 36  6.2% . In the spike gene region  the molecular signature for B.1.1.312 was the non-synonymous mutation A24432T resulting in a deleterious amino acid substitution  Q957L   while the molecular signature for B.1.36.10 was the synonymous mutation C22444T. Bayesian analysis revealed that the UK variant of concern  B.1.1.7  was introduced into Jordan in late November 2020  mean estimate ; four weeks earlier than its official reporting in the country. In Jordan  an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases due to B.1.1.7 lineage coincided with the new year 2021. The highest proportion of phylogenetic clustering was detected for the B.1.1.7 lineage. The amino acid substitution D614G in the spike glycoprotein was exclusively present in the country from July 2020 onwards. Two Jordanian lineages dominated infections in the country  with continuous introduction emergence of new lineages. In Jordan  the rapid spread of the UK variant of concern should be monitored closely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutants appeared to be related to the founder effect; nevertheless  the biological impact of certain mutations should be further investigated.

Genome sequencing is the gold standard method to identify the emerging variants of concern. But it is time-consuming and expensive  limiting the widespread deployment of genome surveillance in some countries. Health authorities surge the development of alternative assay to expand screening capacity with reduced time and cost. In this study  we developed an in-house TaqMan minor groove binder  MGB  probe-based one-step RT-qPCR assay to detect the presence of N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2. A total of 168 SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory specimens were collected to determine diagnostic accuracy of the RT-qPCR assay. As a reference standard  PANGO lineages and the mutation patterns of all samples were characterised by whole-genome sequencing. The analytical sensitivity and the ability of the assay to detect low frequency of N501Y variants were also evaluated. A total of 31 PANGO lineages were identified from 168 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases  in which 34 samples belonged to N501Y variants  including B.1.1.7  n = 20   B.1.351  n = 12  and P.3  n = 2 . The N501Y RT-qPCR correctly identified all 34 samples as N501Y-positive and the other 134 samples as wildtype. The limit-of-detection of the assay consistently achieved 1.5 copies μL on four different qPCR platforms. N501Y mutation was successfully detected at an allele frequency as low as 10% in a sample with mixed SARS-CoV-2 lineage. The N501Y RT-qPCR is simple and inexpensive  US$1.6 per sample . It enables robust high-throughput screening for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern harbouring N501Y mutation.

Brazil is the third-most affected country worldwide  but genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains are mostly restricted to states from the Southeast region. Pernambuco state  located in the Northeast region  is the sixth most affected Brazilian state  but very few genomic sequences from the strains circulating in this region are available. We sequenced 101 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from patients presenting Covid-19 symptoms that reside in Pernambuco. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that all genomes belong to the B lineage and most of the samples  88%  were classified as lineage B.1.1. We detected multiple viral introductions from abroad  likely from Europe  as well as six local B.1.1 clades composed by Pernambuco only strains. Local clades comprise sequences from the capital city  Recife  and other country-side cities  corroborating the community spread between different municipalities of the state. These findings demonstrate that different from Southeastern Brazilian states where the epidemics were majorly driven by one dominant lineage  B.1.1.28 or B.1.1.33   the early epidemic phase at the Pernambuco state was driven by multiple B.1.1 lineages seeded through both national and international traveling.

Omicron  B.1.1.529  rapidly spread worldwide. The large number of mutations in its Spike raise concerns about a major antigenic drift that could significantly decrease vaccine efficacy and infection-induced immunity. A long interval between BNT162b2 mRNA doses elicit antibodies that efficiently recognize Spikes from different VOCs. Here we evaluate the recognition of Omicron Spike by plasma from a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously infected individuals that received their BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 16-weeks apart. Omicron Spike is recognized less efficiently than D614G  Alpha  Beta  Gamma and Delta Spikes. We compare to plasma activity from participants receiving a short  4-weeks  interval regimen. Plasma from individuals of the long interval cohort recognize and neutralize better the Omicron Spike compared to those that received a short interval. Whether this difference confers any clinical benefit against Omicron remains unknown.

We report here affinity maturation of monobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and their neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1  Pango v.3.1.14  as well as four variants of concern. We selected matured monobodies from libraries with multi-site saturation mutagenesis on the recognition loops through in vitro selection. One clone  the C4-AM2 monobody  showed extremely high affinity  K D  < 0.01 nM  against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1  even in monomer form. Furthermore  the C4-AM2 monobody efficiently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1  IC 50  = 46 pM  0.62 ng ml   and the Alpha  IC 50  = 77 pM  1.0 ng ml   Beta  IC 50  = 0.54 nM  7.2 ng ml   Gamma  IC 50  = 0.55 nM  7.4 ng ml   and Delta  IC 50  = 0.59 nM  8.0 ng ml  variants. The obtained monobodies would be useful as neutralizing proteins against current and potentially hazardous future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged  and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants  first identified in the United Kingdom  B.1.1.7  also called VUI202012 01   contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy  vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization  albeit at moderately reduced levels  ~2-fold   by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273  Moderna   and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373  Novavax . Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain  RBD  of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines  or for an increased risk of reinfection.

The total nucleic acid contents of samples from 159 patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from these patients were examined for variants in spike protein RBD. In January 2021  three family members  one aged in their 40s and two aged under 10 years old  were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring W152L E484K G769V mutations. These three patients were living in Japan and had no history of traveling abroad. After identifying these cases  we developed a TaqMan assay to screen for the above hallmark mutations and identified an additional 14 patients with the same mutations. The associated virus strain was classified into the GR clade  Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data [GISAID]   20B clade  Nextstrain   and R.1 lineage  Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak [PANGO] Lineages . As of April 22  2021  R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in 2 388 SARS-CoV-2 entries in the GISAID database  many of which were from Japan  38.2%; 913 2 388  and the United States  47.1%; 1 125 2 388 . Compared with that in the United States  the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 isolates belonging to the R.1 lineage in Japan increased more rapidly over the period from October 24  2020 to April 18  2021. R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has potential escape mutations in the spike protein RBD  E484K  and N-terminal domain  W152L ; therefore  it will be necessary to continue to monitor the R.1 lineage as it spreads around the world.

This participant had a positive RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2 upon routine sampling on study day 7  although he was asymptomatic at that time. He cleared the infection within seven days. On study day 46  he had developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 again. Viral whole genome sequencing was conducted from nares swabs at multiple time points. The day 7 sample was determined to be lineage B.1.340  whereas both the day 46 and day 49 samples were B.1.1. The first positive result for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM serology was collected on day 49 and for IgG on day 91. This case appears most consistent with a reinfection event. Our investigation into this case is unique in that we compared sequence data from more than just paired specimens  and we also assayed for immune response after both the initial infection and the later reinfection. These data demonstrate that individuals who have experienced an infection with SARS-CoV-2 may fail to generate effective or long-lasting immunity  similar to endemic human beta coronaviruses.

However  the specific factors that drove the emergence of such variants since the second half of 2020 are not fully resolved. In this study  we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 P.1 sub-lineage circulating in Brazil  denoted here as Gamma-like-II  that as well as the previously described lineage Gamma-like-I shares several lineage-defining mutations with the VOC Gamma. Reconstructions of ancestor sequences support that most lineage-defining mutations of the Spike  S  protein  including those at the receptor-binding domain  RBD   accumulated at the first P.1 ancestor. In contrast  mutations outside the S protein were mostly fixed at subsequent steps. Our evolutionary analyses estimate that P.1-ancestral strains carrying RBD mutations of concern probably circulated cryptically in the Amazonas for several months before the emergence of the VOC Gamma. Unlike the VOC Gamma  the other P.1 sub-lineages displayed a much more restricted dissemination and accounted for a low fraction  <2 per cent  of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Brazil in 2021. The stepwise diversification of lineage P.1 through multiple inter-host transmissions is consistent with the hypothesis that partial immunity acquired from natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in heavily affected regions might have been a major driving force behind the natural selection of some VOCs. The lag time between the emergence of the P.1 ancestor and the expansion of the VOC Gamma and the divergent epidemic trajectories of P.1 sub-lineages support a complex interplay between the emergence of mutations of concern and viral spread in Brazil.

Our approach harnesses both conventional and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and easily matches the spatial scale of single-virus cell checkpoints. After its validation through the characterization of infected cells and virus morphology  we leveraged this toolbox to reveal subtle issues related to the entry phase of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Vero E6 cells. Our results show that in Vero E6 cells the B.1.1.7 strain  aka Alpha Variant of Concern  is associated with much faster kinetics of endocytic uptake compared to its ancestor B.1.177. Given the cell-entry scenario dominated by the endosomal “late pathway”  the faster internalization of B.1.1.7 could be directly related to the N501Y mutation in the S protein  which is known to strengthen the binding of Spike receptor binding domain with ACE2. Remarkably  we also directly observed the central role of clathrin as a mediator of endocytosis in the late pathway of entry. In keeping with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis  we highlighted the non-raft membrane localization of ACE2. Overall  we believe that our fluorescence microscopy-based approach represents a fertile strategy to investigate the molecular features of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with cells.

Although sequencing is the gold-standard to detect VOCs  it is labor intensive and is costly. We compared a cost-effective real-time PCR assay that detects single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  of VOCs  with next generation sequencing  NGS  in surveillance of VOCs. Methods & Materials A total of 782 SARS CoV-2 PCR positive samples From May – August 2021 were screened using two variant RT-qPCR assays  Seegene Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 Variant Assay I and II   which detects 7 SNPs in the spike protein assigning them to one of the VOCs. We compared the results of the variant RT-qPCR with Illumina  n=97  and Oxford Nanopore  n=53  platforms in a subset of samples  n=150 . Sequences with > 25x coverage were used and assigned to a Pangolin lineage. Results 516 samples amplified for N501Y and HV69 70 deletion of the spike protein were assigned as alpha  B.1.1.7 . Two samples with spike K417N mutation along with N501Y and E484K were considered to be beta  B.1.351  and 175 samples which are only positive for spike L452R mutation were considered to be delta  B.1.617 . 120 156 samples designated as alpha  22 175 designated as delta and 2 samples designated as beta by RT-qPCR were sequenced either by Illumina or Oxford nanopore platforms. The sequencing results showed a 100% accuracy with the variant RT-qPCR for identification of VOCs. Conclusion RT-qPCR that detected SNPs specific for VOCs  appear to be highly sensitive and specific in detection of VOCs and had a similar specificity of genomic sequencing. Therefore  this could be a rapid and less expensive method for surveillance of VOCs  in lower income countries. However  as it only detects specific SNPs  any emerging mutations of concern in these VOCs or newly emerging variants  will not be detected.
doi:10.3390/v13020146,Biological and Clinical Consequences of Integrin Binding via a Rogue RGD Motif in the SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein,doi:10.3390/v13020146,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498225/,pubmed:33498225,pmc:PMC7909284,Viruses,2021,Biological and Clinical Consequences of Integrin Binding via a Rogue RGD Motif in the SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein,Although ACE2  angiotensin converting enzyme 2  is considered the primary receptor for CoV-2 cell entry  recent reports suggest that alternative pathways may contribute. This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD  arginine-glycine-aspartate  sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways  with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes  endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance  binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state  perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets  could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism  strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion–integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors  including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding  resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant  B.1.1.7  or VUI 202012 01   includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement  N501Y  that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins  with consequent clinical impacts.

The previous outbreak  which was due to the B.1.411 virus  Sri Lankan lineage  resulted in a significantly fewer number of cases and deaths compared to the current outbreak caused by B.1.1.7. Therefore  we sought to explore if the differences in the transmission rates and higher mortality rates with the introduction of B.1.1.7 is due to an increased expression of sub-genomic RNA  which is an essential step in the virus life cycle. Methods & Materials Sputum or nasopharyngeal samples of 472 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the analysis. Samples with the cycle threshold <30  were sequenced using 247 amplicons targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome  MN908947v3 . Library preparation was done using AmpliSeq prep kit and sequenced either on illumina iSeq100 or Nextseq550 platforms. Basecalling and demultiplexing were done using the default bcl2fastq  v2.20  pipeline. Raw index-trimmed fastqs were analyzed for sub-genomic RNA using Periscope  https:  github.com sheffield-bioinformatics-core periscope . Raw reads were aligned and checked for the leader sequence at the start of each open reading frame  ORF . The sgRNA detected reads were counted  classified into ORFs and normalized using the genomic RNA counts at each position. Groups were compared with an unpaired Wilcoxon test using R\rstatix package. Figures were generated in R\ggpubr. Results Out of the remaining 434 datasets after the quality control step  164 were of B.1.1.7 lineage while 237 were B.1.4.11. Means of the normalized sgRNA counts between B.1.411 and B.1.1.7 viruses were significantly different in six ORFs. Viruses of the B.1.411 lineage expressed significantly higher sgRNA for Spike protein  p = 0.014   ORF3a  p = 0. 0001   Membrane protein  p = 3.62E-10   ORF8  p = 1.81E-05   and ORF7a  p = 0.0004  than those in B.1.1.7 samples. Contrastingly  Nucleocapsid  N  protein had significantly higher sgRNA expression in B.1.1.7 samples  p=0.0001 . Conclusion Our results suggest that increased expression of sgRNA for a particular virus lineage does not necessarily associate with higher transmissibility as higher expression of sgRNA of B.1.1.7 compared to the B.1.411 lineage virus was only seen for the N protein.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of the circulating virus lineages between March 2020 and February 2021. We performed variant identification  spike mutation pattern analysis  and phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses for 1106 high-coverage whole-genome sequences  implementing maximum likelihood  multiple continuous-time Markov chain  and Bayesian birth–death skyline models. For time trends  logistic regression was used. In the dataset  virus B.1.221 lineage was predominant  15.37%   followed by B.1.258  15.01%  and B.1.1.29  11.48%  strains. Three clades were identified  being responsible for 74.41% of infections over the analyzed period. Expansion in variant diversity was observed since September 2020 with increasing frequency of the number in spike substitutions  mainly H69V70 deletion  P681H  N439K  and S98F. In population dynamics inferences  three periods with exponential increase in infection were observed  beginning in March  July  and September 2020  respectively  and were driven by different virus clades. Additionally  a notable increase in infections caused by the B.1.1.7 lineage since February 2021 was noted. Over time  the virus accumulated mutations related to optimized transmissibility; therefore  faster dissemination is reflected by the second wave of epidemics in Poland.

As pet cats often live in very close contact with their owners  it is essential to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats in a One-Health context. This study reports the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cat in a COVID-19-affected household in Switzerland. The cat  Cat 1  demonstrated signs of an upper respiratory tract infection  including sneezing  inappetence  and apathy  while the cohabiting cat  Cat 2  remained asymptomatic. Nasal  oral  fecal  fur  and environmental swab samples were collected twice from both cats and analyzed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Both nasal swabs from Cat 1 tested positive. In addition  the first oral swab from Cat 2 and fur and bedding swabs from both cats were RT-qPCR positive. The fecal swabs tested negative. The infection of Cat 1 was confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain  RBD  antibody testing and neutralizing activity in a surrogate assay. The viral genome sequence from Cat 1  obtained by next generation sequencing  showed the closest relation to a human sequence from the B.1.1.39 lineage  with one single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  difference. This study demonstrates not only SARS-CoV-2 infection of a cat from a COVID-19-affected household but also contamination of the cats’ fur and bed with viral RNA. Our results are important to create awareness that SARS-CoV-2 infected people should observe hygienic measures to avoid infection and contamination of animal cohabitants.

Several mutations have been reported in the genome of the B.1.1.7 variant including the N501Y and 69-70deletion in the Spike region that has implications on virus transmissibility and diagnostics. Although the B.1.1.7 variant has been reported by several countries  only three cases have been reported in Pakistan through whole-genome sequencing. Therefore  the objective of the study was to investigate the circulation of B.1.1.7 variant of concern  VOC  in Pakistani population. We used a two-step strategy for the detection of B.1.1.7 with initial screening through TaqPath TM  COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR kit  ThermoFisher Scientific  Waltham  US  followed by partial spike  S  gene sequencing of a subset of samples having the spike gene target failure  SGTF . From January 01  2021  to February 21  2021  a total of 2 650 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 70.4%  n = 1 867  showed amplification of all the 3 genes  ORF  N  and S . Notably  29.6%  n=783  samples have been SGTF that represented numbers from all the four provinces and suggest a rather low frequency during the first 3 weeks of January  n = 10  n = 13  and n = 1  respectively . However  the numbers have started to increase in the last week of January  2021. During February  726  93%  cases of SGTF were reported with a peak  n = 345  found during the 3rd week. Based on the partial sequencing of SGTF samples 93.5%  n = 29 31  showed the characteristic N501Y  A570D  P681H  and T716I mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant. In conclusion  our findings showed an upsurge of B.1.1.7 cases in Pakistan during February  2021 affecting 15 districts and warranting large scale genomic surveillance  strengthening of laboratory network and implementation of appropriate control measures in the country.

The aim of this study was to collect data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in bivalve mollusks from harvesting areas of Campania region. A total of 179 samples were collected between September 2019 and April 2021 and were tested using droplet digital RT-PCR  dd RT-PCR  and real-time RT-PCR. Combining results obtained with different assays  SARS-CoV-2 presence was detected in 27 179  15.1%  of samples. A median viral concentration of 1.1 × 10 2  and 1.4 × 10 2  g.c. g was obtained using either Orf1b nsp14 or RdRp gene E  respectively. Positive results were unevenly distributed among harvesting areas and over time  positive samples being more frequent after January 2021. Partial sequencing of the spike region was achieved for five samples  one of which displaying mutations characteristic of the Alpha variant  lineage B.1.1.7 . This study confirms that bivalve mollusks may bioaccumulate SARS-CoV-2 to detectable levels and that they may represent a valuable approach to track SARS-CoV-2 in water bodies and to monitor outbreak trends and viral diversity.

We prospectively evaluated the immunogenicity of the vaccine in triggering both the humoral and the cell-mediated immune response in cancer patients treated with anti PD-1 PD-L1 with or without chemotherapy six months after BNT162b2 vaccine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the previous study  88 patients were enrolled  while the analyses below refer to the 60 patients still on immunotherapy at the time of the follow up. According to previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure  patients were classified in SARS-CoV-2 naïve  without previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure  and SARS-CoV-2 experienced  with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection . Neutralizing antibody  NT Abs  titer against B.1.1 strain and total anti-Spike IgG concentration were quantified in serum samples. ELISpot assay was used for quantification of anti-Spike interferon gamma  IFNγ  producing cells 10 6  peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMC . Fifty patients  83.0%  were on immunotherapy alone  while ten patients  7%  were on chemo-immunotherapy. We analyzed separately patients on immunotherapy and patients on chemo-immunotherapy. RESULTS: Median T-cell response at six months was significantly lower than that measured at three weeks after vaccination  50 interquartile range  IQR  20-118.8 vs 175IQR 67.5-371.3 IFNγ producing cells 10 6  PBMC;p<0.0001 . The median reduction of IgG concentration was 88% in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subject  2.1% in SARS-CoV-2 experienced subjects. SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs titer was stable maintained in SARS-CoV-2 experienced subjects while a significant decrease was observed in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects  from median 1:160 IQR 1:40-1:640 to median 1:20 IQR 1:10-1:40;p<0.0001 . A weak correlation was observed between SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs and Spike-specific IFNγ producing cells at both six months and three weeks after vaccination  r=0.467;p=0.0002 and r=0.428;p=0.0006 respectively . CONCLUSIONS: Our work highlights a reduction in the immune response in cancer patients  particularly in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. Our data support administering third dose of COVID-19 vaccine to cancer patients treated with PD1 PD-L1 inhibitors.

Though nucleic acid-based methods such as RT-PCR are widely available  they require sample preparation and long processing time. PoC diagnostic devices provide relatively faster and stable results. However they require further investigation to provide high accuracy and be adaptable for the new variants. In this study  laser-scribed graphene  LSG  sensors are coupled with gold nanoparticles  AuNPs  as stable promising biosensing platforms. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2  ACE2   an enzymatic receptor  is chosen to be the biorecognition unit due to its high binding affinity towards spike proteins as a key-lock model. The sensor was integrated to a homemade and portable potentistat device  wirelessly connected to a smartphone having a customized application for easy operation. LODs of 5.14 and 2.09 ng mL was achieved for S1 and S2 protein in the linear range of 1.0–200 ng mL  respectively. Clinical study has been conducted with nasopharyngeal swabs from 63 patients having alpha  B.1.1.7   beta  B.1.351   delta  B.1.617.2  variants  patients without mutation and negative patients. A machine learning model was developed with accuracy of 99.37% for the identification of the SARS-Cov-2 variants under 1 min. With the increasing need for rapid and improved disease diagnosis and monitoring  the PoC platform proved its potential for real time monitoring by providing accurate and fast variant identification without any expertise and pre sample preparation  which is exactly what societies need in this time of pandemic.

METHODS: : The study was performed in the context of the mandatory health surveillance at the workplaces  in the period between 25th January 2021 and 26th March 2021  when 6904 HCWs  78% of workforce  gained full protection. HCWs were classified by having received the full vaccine schedule or not. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs  followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. RESULTS: : We observed 84 SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs  most among unvaccinated HCWs. Gene sequencing was successful in 5 cases only  4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants. In the same period  Lombardy registered 192.829 confirmed COVID-19 cases  40.029 of which in Brescia county. The incidence rate of the B.1.1.7 variant rose from 70% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: : Results confirm the protective effects of BNT162b2. The vaccine campaign was effective not only in reducing the appearance of symptoms but also in decreasing the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs. We observed a reduced infection rate also among the residual unvaccinated HCWs.

Hence  T cell and B cell epitopes were derived from the spike glycoprotein sequence of wild SARS-CoV-2. The proposed T cell and B cell epitopes were found to be antigenic and conserved in the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 mutant  B.1.1.7 . Thus  the proposed epitopes are effective against SARS-CoV-2 and its B.1.1.7 mutant. MHC-I that best interacts with the proposed T cell epitopes were found  using immune epitope database. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were done for ensuring a good binding between the proposed MHC-I and T cell epitopes. The finally proposed T cell epitope was found to be antigenic  non-allergenic  non-toxic and stable. Further  the finally proposed B cell epitopes were also found to be antigenic. The population conservation analysis has ensured the presence of MHC-I molecule  respective to the finally proposed T cell  in human population of most affected countries with SARS-CoV-2. Thus the proposed T and B cell epitope could be effective in designing an epitope-based vaccine  which is effective on SARS-CoV-2 and its B.1.1.7mutant.

We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  AZD1222   against this variant. METHODS: Volunteers  aged ≥18 years  who were enrolled in phase 2 3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK  and who were randomly assigned  1:1  to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control  MenACWY  vaccine  provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease  a cough  a fever of 37·8°C or higher  shortness of breath  anosmia  or ageusia . Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test  NAAT  for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage  Victoria . The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 − relative risk  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs MenACWY groups  derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04400838  and ISRCTN  15281137. FINDINGS: Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13  2020  and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30  2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort  6636  78%  were aged 18–55 years and 5065  59%  were female. Between Oct 1  2020  and Jan 14  2021  520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these  401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage  geometric mean ratio 8·9  95% CI 7·2–11·0 . Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4%  95% CI 43·6–84·5  for B.1.1.7 and 81·5%  67·9–89·4  for non-B.1.1.7 lineages. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro  but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

This increase coincided with the spread of more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  including B.1.1.7  1 3  and relaxation of COVID-19 prevention strategies such as those for businesses  large-scale gatherings  and educational activities. To provide long-term projections of potential trends in COVID-19 cases  hospitalizations  and deaths  COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub teams used a multiple-model approach comprising six models to assess the potential course of COVID-19 in the United States across four scenarios with different vaccination coverage rates and effectiveness estimates and strength and implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions  NPIs   public health policies  such as physical distancing and masking  over a 6-month period  April-September 2021  using data available through March 27  2021  4 . Among the four scenarios  an accelerated decline in NPI adherence  which encapsulates NPI mandates and population behavior  was shown to undermine vaccination-related gains over the subsequent 2-3 months and  in combination with increased transmissibility of new variants  could lead to surges in cases  hospitalizations  and deaths. A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021  with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. High vaccination rates and compliance with public health prevention measures are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months.

We report here the preclinical development of yeast-produced receptor-binding domain  RBD -based recombinant protein SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We found that monomeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could be efficiently produced as a secreted protein from transformed Pichia pastoris  P. pastoris  yeast. Yeast-derived RBD-monomer possessed functional conformation and was able to elicit protective level of neutralizing antibodies in mice. We further designed and expressed a genetically linked dimeric RBD protein in yeast. The engineered dimeric RBD was more potent than the monomeric RBD in inducing long-lasting neutralizing antibodies. Mice immunized with either monomeric RBD or dimeric RBD were effectively protected from live SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge even at 18 weeks after the last vaccine dose. Importantly  we found that the antisera raised against the RBD of a single SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain could effectively neutralize the two predominant circulating variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351  implying broad-spectrum protective potential of the RBD-based vaccines. Our data demonstrate that yeast-derived RBD-based recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are feasible and efficacious  opening up a new avenue for rapid and cost-effective production of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to achieve global immunization.

Despite continuing circulation of the SARS-CoV-2  very limited studies have been conducted on genetic evolutionary analysis of the virus in Bangladesh. In this study  a total of 791 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Bangladesh deposited in the GISAID database during March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of seven GISAID clades G  GH  GR  GRY  L  O  and S or five Nextstrain clades 20A  20B  20C  19A  and 19B in the country during the study period. The GISAID clade GR or the Nextstrain clade 20B or lineage B.1.1.25 is predominant in Bangladesh and closely related to the sequences from India  USA  Canada  UK  and Italy. The GR clade or B.1.1.25 lineage is likely to be responsible for the widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country during the first wave of infection. Significant amino acid diversity was observed among Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates  where a total of 1023 mutations were detected. In particular  the D614G mutation in the spike protein  S_D614G  was found in 97% of the sequences. However  the introduction of lineage B.1.1.7  UK variant S_N501Y  and S_E484K mutation in lineage B.1.1.25 in a few sequences reported in late December 2020 is of particular concern. The wide genomic diversity indicated multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Bangladesh through various routes. Therefore  a continuous and extensive genome sequence analysis would be necessary to understand the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh.

Here  we examined how time affects antibody potency. To assess the impact of antibody maturation on durable neutralizing activity against original SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern  VOCs   we analyzed receptor binding domain  RBD -specific IgG antibodies in convalescent plasma taken 1–10 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longitudinal evaluation of total RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody revealed declining total antibody titers but improved neutralization potency per antibody to original SARS-CoV-2  indicative of antibody response maturation. Neutralization assays with authentic viruses revealed that early antibodies capable of neutralizing original SARS-CoV-2 had limited reactivity toward B.1.351  501Y.V2  and P.1  501Y.V3  variants. Antibodies from late convalescents exhibited increased neutralization potency to VOCs  suggesting persistence of cross-neutralizing antibodies in plasma. Thus  maturation of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 potentiates cross-neutralizing ability to circulating variants  suggesting that declining antibody titers may not be indicative of declining protection.

Genomic epidemiology has emerged as a valuable tool to understand introductions and spread of the virus in a specific geographic location. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here  we report the sequences of 59 SARS-CoV-2 samples from inhabitants of the Colombian Amazonas department. The viral genomes were distributed in two robust clusters within the distinct GISAID clades GH and G. Spatial-temporal analyses revealed two independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in the region  one around April 1  2020 associated with a local transmission  and one around April 2  2020 associated with other South American genomes  Uruguay and Brazil . We also identified ten lineages circulating in the Amazonas department including the P.1 variant of concern  VOC . CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first genomic epidemiology investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the territories with the highest report of indigenous communities of the country. Such findings are essential to decipher viral transmission  inform on global spread and to direct implementation of infection prevention and control measures for these vulnerable populations  especially  due to the recent circulation of one of the variants of concern  P.1  associated with major transmissibility and possible reinfections.

Large-scale  accurate  affordable  and rapid diagnostic tests such as the lateral flow assay can help prevent community transmission  but their performance characteristics in real-world conditions and relevant subpopulations remain unclear. Methods : The COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test kit  Eternal Materials  New Taipei City  Taiwan  was used in a high-throughput community testing site; the paired reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  results served as a reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Results : Of 2 096 specimens tested using the rapid antigen tests  70  3.33%  were positive and 2 026  96.7%  were negative. This clinical performance was compared with the RT-PCR results. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test were 76.39%  95% CI  64.91–85.60%  and 99.26%  95% CI  98.78–99.58%   respectively  with high sensitivity in subjects with threshold cycle ≤24. Further  the COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test kit effectively detected the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage. Conclusions : Considering the short turnaround times and lower costs  this simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test for rapid screening combined with RT-PCR as a double confirmatory screening tool can facilitate the prevention of community transmission during COVID-19 emergencies.

Here  we use a live virus neutralization assay with sera from Pfizer- and Moderna-vaccinated individuals to examine neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and observe a 3.9- and 2.7-fold reduction  respectively  in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant compared with an early isolate bearing only a D614G substitution in its spike protein. We observe similar reduced sensitivity with sera from hamsters that were previously infected with an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Despite this reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant  hamsters previously infected  up to 15 months earlier  with an early isolate are protected from infection with the Delta variant  suggesting that the immune response to the first infection is sufficient to provide protection against subsequent infection with the Delta variant.

The third major cause of mortality in the United States  following heart disease and cancer in 2020  was undoubtedly COVID-19. The centers for disease control and prevention  CDC  and the world health organization  WHO  separately developed a categorization system for differentiating new strains of SARS-CoV-2 into variants of concern  VoCs  and variants of interest  VoIs  with the continuing development of various strains SARS-CoV-2. By December 2021  five of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs were discovered from the onset of the pandemic depending on the latest epidemiologic report by the WHO: Alpha  B.1.1.7   Beta  B.1.351   Gamma  P.1   Delta  B.1.617.2   and Omicron  B.1.1.529 . Mutations in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and n-terminal domain  NTD  have been found throughout all five identified VoCs. All strains other than the delta mutant are often found with the N501Y mutation situated on the RBD  resulting in higher binding between the spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptors  enhanced viral adhesion  and following the entrance to host cells. The introduction of these new strains of SRAS-CoV-2 is likely to overcome the remarkable achievements gained in restricting this viral disease to the point where it is presented with remarkable vaccine developments against COVID-19 and strong worldwide mass immunization initiatives. Throughout this literature review  the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines for managing and prohibiting SARS-CoV-2 strains is thoroughly described.

In this study  we construct the spherical amantadine-assembled nanostimulator  AAS . Amantadine as immunostimulating molecules are displayed on the outermost layer of AAS. Molecular mechanism analysis reveals that AAS can activate RIG-I-like receptor  RLR  signaling pathway to increase the expression of type I interferons in vivo. AAS-mediated activation of RLR signaling pathway further promotes the maturation and proliferation of dendritic cells  DCs  and T helper cells  Ths   finally activating B cells to produce potent antibody responses. In performance evaluation experiments  the mixture of AAS and dimeric RBD significantly enhances RBD-specific humoral responses  4-fold IgG  3.5-fold IgG2a  3.3-fold IgG2b  3.8-fold IgG3 and 1.3-fold IgM   in comparison to aluminum adjuvant-assistant dimeric RBD. Importantly  AAS dramatically elevates dimeric RBD-elicited cross-neutralization against different SARS-CoV-2 strains such as Wuhan-Hu-1  9-fold   B.1.1.7  UK variant  15-fold   B.1.351  South African variant  4-fold  and B.1.617.2  India variant  7-fold . Our study verifies the mechanism of AAS in activating RLR signaling pathway in host immune system and highlights the power of AAS in improving antigen-elicited cross-neutralization against different SARS-CoV-2 strains.

From a set of 3595 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences  128 lineages were identified in non-human hosts  the majority represented by the variants of concern Delta  n = 1105  30.7%  and Alpha  n = 466  12.9%   followed by B.1.1.298 lineage  n = 458  12.7% . Environment  Neovison vison  Odocoileus virginianus and Felis catus were the non-human sources with the highest number of lineages  14  12 and 10  respectively . Phylogenomic analyses showed viral clusters from environmental sources  N. vison  O. virginianus  Panthera tigris  and Panthera leo. These clusters were collectively related to human viruses as well as all other non-human sources that were heterogeneously distributed in the phylogenetic tree. Further  the genetic details of viral genomes from bats and pangolins were independently investigated owing to their high divergence  revealing five distinct clusters. Cluster 4 exclusively included bat-sourced genomes and the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain Wuhan-01. In summary  this study identified new genetic landmarks of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We propose potential interspecies transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 between animals and humans  which should be considered in order to establish better pathogen surveillance and containment strategies.

We here tested infectivity and neutralization efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses bearing particular mutations of the receptor-binding domain  RBD  derived either from the Wuhan strains  referred to as D614G or with other sites  or the B.1.351 lineage  referred to as N501Y  K417N  and E484K . The three different pseudoviruses B.1.351 lineage related significantly increased infectivity compared with other mutants that indicated Wuhan strains. Interestingly  K417N and E484K mutations dramatically enhanced cell–cell fusion than N501Y even though their infectivity were similar  suggesting that K417N and E484K mutations harboring SARS-CoV-2 variant might be more transmissible than N501Y mutation containing SARS-CoV-2 variant. We also investigated the efficacy of two different monoclonal antibodies  Casirivimab and Imdevimab that neutralized SARS-CoV-2  against several kinds of pseudoviruses which indicated Wuhan or B.1.351 lineage. Remarkably  Imdevimab effectively neutralized B.1.351 lineage pseudoviruses containing N501Y  K417N  and E484K mutations  while Casirivimab partially affected them. Overall  our results underscore the importance of B.1.351 lineage SARS-CoV-2 in the viral spread and its implication for antibody efficacy.

In this prospective observational cohort study  we analyzed serological immune responses in 190 individuals before  3 weeks after 1 st  and 3 weeks after 2 nd  vaccination with BNT162b2. Unvaccinated COVID-19-convalescent subjects served as reference. End points comprised serum anti-spike IgG and IgA titers as well as neutralization capacities against unmutated and mutated SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains including B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1. We found that antibody titers and neutralization capacities up to 3 weeks after 2 nd  vaccination with BNT162b2 were significantly higher in COVID-19-convalescent as compared to COVID-19-naive vaccinees. Moreover  pre-vaccination anti-NCP IgG titers  but not age or gender  had a high impact on the strength and kinetics of post-vaccination neutralization capacity development. Most importantly  BNT162b2-induced neutralization capacity was cross-reactive with VOCs. In contrast to unvaccinated convalescents  vaccinated convalescent individuals of all ages acquired strong neutralizing capacities against current VOCs. The present study suggests that COVID-19-convalescent individuals with a broad age range between 18 and 98 years benefit from BNT162b2 vaccination by developing strong and broad neutralizing immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 including current VOCs.

We have identified 20 mutations that are widespread in variant of concern lineages and affect widely used sequencing protocols by the ARTIC network and Freed et al.. We show how three of these mutations disrupted sequencing of P.1 lineage specimens during a recent outbreak in British Columbia  Canada  and we provide laboratory validation of protocol modifications that restored sequencing performance. Our findings indicate that genomic sequencing protocols require immediate updating to address emerging mutations. This work also suggests that routine monitoring and protocol updates will be necessary as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. The bioinformatic and laboratory approaches used here provide guidance for this kind of assay maintenance.

The P681H mutation in the “PRRAR” furin cleavage site might affect the binding affinity to furin enzyme and hence its infectivity. Therefore  in this study  various structural bioinformatics approaches were used to model the S-protein structure with the B.1.1.7 variant amino acid substitutions and deletions. In addition to modelling the binding of furin to the cleavage site of the wild-type and the B.1.1.7 variant. Conclusively the B.1.1.7 variant resulted in dynamic stability  conformational changes and variations in binding energies in the S-protein structure  resulting in a more favourable binding of furin enzyme to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.

Whilst African countries were relatively spared initially  the initial low incidence of COVID-19 cases was not sustained for long due to continuing travel links between China  Europe and Africa.. In preparation  Zambia had applied a multisectoral national epidemic disease surveillance and response system resulting in the identification of the first case within 48 hours of the individual entering the country by air travel from a trip to France. Contact tracing showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was contained within the patient’s household  with no further spread to attending health care workers or community members. Phylogenomic analysis of the patient’s SARS-CoV-2 strain showed it belonged to lineage B.1.1.  sharing the last common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from South Africa. At the African continental level  our analysis showed that lineage B.1 and B.1.1 lineages appear to be predominant in Africa. Whole genome sequence analysis should be part of all surveillance and case detection activities in order to monitor the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages across Africa.

Study Design: This was a prospective observational case-control study of infants born to women who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR at any time during their pregnancy  n=15 . The study was carried out in a Tertiary University Maternity Hospital  8 500 deliveries year  in Ireland. This study was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written consent was obtained. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery  full blood count and Calibrated Automated Thrombography were performed. Demographics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Healthy term infants  previously recruited as controls to a larger study prior to the outbreak of COVID-19  were the historical control population  n=10 . RESULTS: Infants born to women with SARS-CoV-2 had similar growth parameters  birth weight 3600g v 3680g  p=0.83  and clinical outcomes to healthy controls  such as need for resuscitation at birth  2  13.3%  v 1  10%   p=1.0  and NICU admission  1  6.7%  v 2  20%   p=0.54 . Haematological parameters  Haemoglobin  platelet  white cell and lymphocyte counts  in the COVID-19 group were all within normal neonatal reference ranges. Calibrated Automated Thrombography revealed no differences in any thrombin generation parameters  lag time  p=0.92   endogenous thrombin potential  p=0.24   peak thrombin  p=0.44   time to peak thrombin  p=0.94   between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this prospective study including eligible cases in a very large population of approximately 1500 women  there was no evidence of derangement of the haematological parameters or hypercoagulability in umbilical cord blood due to COVID-19. Further research is required to investigate the pathological placental changes  particularly COVID-19 placentitis and the impact of different strains of SARS-CoV-2  particularly the B.1.1.7 variant  and the severity and timing of infection on the developing fetus.

In this study  nine receptor-binding domain  RBD  proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants  B.1.1.7  B.1.351 and P.1 lineages  were constructed and fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG  RBD-Fc . These RBD-Fc proteins contained single or multiple amino acid substitutions at prevalent mutation points of spike protein  which enabled them to bind strongly to the polyclonal antibodies specific for wild-type RBD and to the recombinant human ACE2 protein. In the BALB c  mice were immunized with the wild-type RBD-Fc protein first and boosted twice with the indicated mutant RBD-Fc proteins later. All mutant RBD-Fc proteins elicited high-level IgG antibodies and cross-neutralizing antibodies. The RBD-Fc proteins with multiple substitutions tended to induce higher antibody titers and neutralizing-antibody titers than the single-mutant RBD-Fc proteins. Meanwhile  both wild-type RBD-Fc protein and mutant RBD-Fc proteins induced significantly decreased neutralization capacity to the pseudovirus of B.1.351 and P.1 lineages than to the wild-type one. These data will facilitate the design and development of RBD-based subunit vaccines against SARS-COV-2 and its variants.

In this study  complete genome sequences of the virus in the samples obtained from three patients in Alborz province in May and June 2020 were generated and analyzed using bioinformatic methods. The sequenced genomes were positioned in a cluster with B.4 lineage along with the sequences from other countries namely  Turkey  United Arab Emirates and China. There were seven single nucleotide variations  SNVs  in common in all samples and only one of the sequenced genomes showed the D614G amino acid substitution. Three SNVs  1397 G>A  28688 T>C  29742 G>T  which had already been reported in February  were found with high frequency in all the sequenced genomes in this study  implying that viral diversity reflected in the early stages of viral transmission in Iran were established in the second wave. Considering the importance of molecular epidemiology in response to ongoing pandemic  there is an urgent need for more complete genome sequencing and comprehensive analyses to gain insight into the transmission  adaptation and evolution of the virus in Iran.

Since that time  the virus has spread around the world  which resulted in an announcement of the World Health Organization  WHO   dated in March 2020  that COVID-19 was a worldwide pandemic  and since then  the world has been struggling with this disease. SARS-CoV-2  similar to other RNA viruses  continually mutates  and new variants are appearing. Among large numbers of detected SARS-CoV-2 variants  only an insignificant amount of them are able to pose a risk to public health  as they are more contagious and cause more severe conditions. The emerged variants were classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  in collaboration with SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group  SIG  according to strictly defined pattern. Variants were classified as variants of concern  variants of interest  and variants of high consequence. In the last few months  three variants of concern  B.1.1.7  B.1.351  and P.1  and four variants of interests  B.1.526  B.1.525  B.1.427 B.1.429  and P.2  were distinguished and are essential for close monitoring. This analysis summarizes the principal information concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants  such as their infectivity  severity  mutations  and immune susceptibility.

METHODS: All COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Guangdong Province from September 1  2020 to February 28  2021  were included and were divided into asymptomatic and symptomaticgroup. The source country of all patients  clinical laboratory test results  the genotype of virus and the time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turning negative or hospitalization were confirmed. RESULTS: Total 233 patients from 57 different countries or regions were included  with 83  35.6%  asymptomatic and 150  64.4%  symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic cases were younger  P = 0.019   lower rate in comorbidities  P = 0.021  such as hypertension  P = 0.083  and chronic liver disease  P = 0.045   lower PCT  P = 0.021   DDI  P < 0.001  and ALT  P = 0.029   but higher WBC count  P = 0.002  and lymphocyte  P = 0.011  than symptomatic patients. As for SARS-CoV-2 subtypes  patients infected with B.1.1  53.8%   B.1.351  81.8%  and B.1.524  60%  are mainly asymptomatic  while infected with B  B.1  B.1.1.63  B.1.1.7  B.1.36  B.1.36.1  B.1.36.16  B.1.5 and B.6 were inclined to be symptomatic. Patients infected with variant B.1.351 and B.1.524 spent longer time in SARS-CoV-2 RNA turn negative  26 days  P = 0.085; 41 days  P = 0.007  and hospitalization  28 days  P = 0.085; 43 days  P = 0.004 . CONCLUSIONS: The asymptomatic cases are prone to develop in patients with younger age  less comorbidities andinfected with B.1.1 and B.1.524 variants. More attention should be paid for lineage B.1.524 because it can significantly prolong the SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative conversion time and hospitalization in infected cases.

The impact of this new mutation—which occurs in the S protein—on infectivity  virulence  and current vaccine effectiveness is still under evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to sequence SARS-CoV-2 samples of cases in Romania to detect the B.1.1.7 variant and compare these samples with sequences submitted to GISAID. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced and amino acid substitution analysis was performed using the CoV-GLUE platform. RESULTS: We have identified the first cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in samples collected from Romanian patients  of which one was traced to the region of the United Kingdom where the new variant was originally sequenced. Mutations in nonstructural protein 3  Nsp3; N844S and D455N  and ORF3a  L15F  were also detected  indicating common ancestry with UK strains as well as remote connections with strains from Nagasaki  Japan. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate  for the first time  the presence and characteristics of the new variant B.1.1.7 in Romania and underscore the need for increased genomic sequencing in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

Genomic epidemiology is an important tool to assess the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 . Several mutations have been reported by genome analysis of the SARS-CoV-2. In the present study  we investigated the mutational and phylogenetic analysis of 30 whole-genome sequences for the virus's genomic characteristics in the specimens collected in the early phase of the pandemic  March–June  2020  and the sudden surge of local transmission  August–September  2020 . The four samples in the early phase of infection were B.6 lineage and located within a clade of the samples collected at the same time in Singapore and Malaysia  while five returnees by rescue flights showed the lineage B. 1.36.1  three from India   B.1.1  one from India  and B.1.80  one from China . However  there was no evidence of local spread from these returnees. Further  all 19 whole-genome sequences collected in the sudden surge of local transmission showed lineage B.1.36. The surge of the second wave on SARS-CoV-2 infection was linked to the single-introduction of a variant  B.1.36  that may result from the strict restriction of international travel and containment efforts. These genomic data provides the useful information to disease control and prevention strategy.

However  knowledge concerning long-term kinetics of antibody responses in convalescent patients is limited. During a one-year period post symptom onset  we longitudinally collected 162 samples from 76 patients and quantified IgM and IgG antibodies recognizing the nucleocapsid  N  protein or the receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein  S . After one year  approximately 90% of recovered patients still had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies recognizing N and RBD-S. Intriguingly  neutralizing activity was only detectable in ~43% of patients. When neutralization tests against the E484K-mutated variant of concern  VOC  B.1.351  initially identified in South Africa  were performed among patients who neutralize the original virus  the capacity to neutralize was even further diminished to 22.6% of donors. Despite declining N- and S-specific IgG titers  a considerable fraction of recovered patients had detectable neutralizing activity one year after infection. However  neutralizing capacities  in particular against an E484K-mutated VOC were only detectable in a minority of patients one year after symptomatic COVID-19. Our findings shed light on the kinetics of long-term immune responses after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and argue for vaccinations of individuals who experienced a natural infection to protect against emerging VOC.

Concomitantly  such introductions fuel worries about a possible increase in transmissibility and disease severity  as well as a possible decrease in vaccine efficacy. Military personnel are frequently deployed on missions around the world. As part of a COVID-19 risk mitigation strategy  Belgian Armed Forces that engaged in missions and operations abroad were screened  7683 RT-qPCR tests   pre- and post-mission  for the presence of SARS-CoV-2  including the identification of viral lineages. Nine distinct viral genotypes were identified in soldiers returning from operations in Niger  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Afghanistan  and Mali. The SARS-CoV-2 variants belonged to major clades 19B  20A  and 20B  Nextstrain nomenclature   and included “variant of interest” B.1.525  “variant under monitoring” A.27  as well as lineages B.1.214  B.1  B.1.1.254  and A  pangolin nomenclature   some of which are internationally monitored due to the specific mutations they harbor. Through contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis  we show that isolation and testing policies implemented by the Belgian military command appear to have been successful in containing the influx and transmission of these distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants into military and civilian populations.

Although large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has facilitated hospital and public health responses  access to sequencing facilities globally is variable and turnaround times can be significant  so there is a requirement for rapid and cost-effective alternatives. Applying a polymerase chain reaction  PCR -based single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  approach enables rapid  <4 h  identification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from nucleic acid extracts  through the presence or absence of a panel of defined of genomic polymorphisms. For example  the B.1.1.7 lineage  “UK”  “Alpha”  or “Kent” variant  is characterised by 23 mutations compared to the reference strain  and the most biologically significant of these are found in the S gene. We have developed a SARS-CoV-2 typing assay focused on five positions in the S gene  HV69 70  N501  K417  E484 and P681 . This configuration can identify a range of variants  including all the “Variants of Concern” currently designated by national and international public health bodies. The panel has been evaluated using a range of clinical isolates and standardised control materials at four UK hospitals and shows excellent concordance with the known lineage information derived from full sequence analysis. The assay has a turnaround time of about three hours for a set of up to 24 samples and has been utilised to identify emerging variants in a clinical setting.
pubmed:35169598,Omicron BA.2  B.1.1.529.2 : high potential to becoming the next dominating variant,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35169598/,pubmed:35169598,pmc:PMC8845508,ArXiv,2022,Omicron BA.2  B.1.1.529.2 : high potential to becoming the next dominating variant,The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has rapidly replaced the Delta variant as a dominating SARS-CoV-2 variant because of natural selection  which favors the variant with higher infectivity and stronger vaccine breakthrough ability. Omicron has three lineages or subvariants  BA.1  B.1.1.529.1   BA.2  B.1.1.529.2   and BA.3  B.1.1.529.3 . Among them  BA.1 is the currently prevailing subvariant. BA.2 shares 32 mutations with BA.1 but has 28 distinct ones. BA.3 shares most of its mutations with BA.1 and BA.2 except for one. BA.2 is found to be able to alarmingly reinfect patients originally infected by Omicron BA.1. An important question is whether BA.2 or BA.3 will become a new dominating “variant of concern”. Currently  no experimental data has been reported about BA.2 and BA.3. We construct a novel algebraic topology-based deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of mutational and deep mutational data to systematically evaluate BA.2’s and BA.3’s infectivity  vaccine breakthrough capability  and antibody resistance. Our comparative analysis of all main variants namely  Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta  Lambda  Mu  BA.1  BA.2  and BA.3  unveils that BA.2 is about 1.5 and 4.2 times as contagious as BA.1 and Delta  respectively. It is also 30% and 17-fold more capable than BA.1 and Delta  respectively  to escape current vaccines. Therefore  we project that Omicron BA.2 is on its path to becoming the next dominating variant. We forecast that like Omicron BA.1  BA.2 will also seriously compromise most existing mAbs  except for sotrovimab developed by GlaxoSmithKline.

Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now  more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein  we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots  GQDs  have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant  B.1.617.2  spike protein receptor-binding domain  RBD  binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2 . Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs  in the presence of the delta variant spike protein  the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile  which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation  we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM  which is comparable with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity  8 nM . Using the alpha  beta  and gamma variant spike-RBD  experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.

Though vaccines are available  the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study  we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain  RBD  with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type  WT   B.1.1.7  and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant  also known as 501Y.V2  shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484  yet the RBD–ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.

Interestingly  the neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages was significantly higher  whereas the neutralization of B.1.351 and P.1 lineages was robust but significantly lower as compared to B.1 lineage. Following our findings  we consider that the BNT162b2 vaccine offers protection against the current prevailing variants of SARS-CoV-2.

The challenge to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic is further compounded by the emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants viz. B.1.1.7  Alpha   B.1.351  Beta   P1  Gamma  and B.1.617.2  Delta   which show increased transmissibility and resistance towards vaccines and therapies. Importantly  there is convincing evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals with dysregulated immune response and comorbidities. Herein  we provide a comprehensive perspective regarding vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with underlying medical comorbidities. We discuss ongoing vaccine  mRNA  protein-based  viral vector-based  etc.  and therapeutic  monoclonal antibodies  small molecules  plasma therapy  etc.  modalities designed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss in detail  the challenges posed by different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOC  identified across the globe and their effects on therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.
